<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:13:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Which drug (rocuronium or succinylcholine) is better at providing excellent conditions to quickly insert breathing tubes into participants of all ages for elective and emergency situations?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In emergency situations some people need a general anaesthetic with an endotracheal tube (a tube to help them breathe). It is important to have fast-acting medications to allow physicians to complete this procedure quickly and safely. Currently, the medication used most frequently to relax muscles is succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is fast-acting and lasts for only a few minutes, which is very desirable in this setting. However, some people cannot use this medication as it can cause serious salt imbalances or reactions, so an equally effective medication without these side effects would be advantageous. One possible alternative medication is rocuronium, a muscle relaxant with fewer side effects but longer duration of action. This review compares the quality of intubation conditions (the ease with which physicians can quickly and safely pass the endotracheal tube) between rocuronium and succinylcholine in all ages and varying clinical situations.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included in the review controlled trials from 1966 to February 2015 involving participants of all ages needing rapid intubation using rocuronium and succinylcholine . The minimum dose of rocuronium given was 0.6mg/kg and succinylcholine was 1mg/kg. We have combined the results of 50 trials, with a total of 4151 participants, which compared the effectiveness of succinylcholine versus rocuronium on intubation conditions. No major side effects from use of the drugs were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We have found that rocuronium is slightly less effective than succinylcholine for creating excellent and acceptable intubation conditions. Rocuronium should therefore only be used as an alternative to succinylcholine when it is known that succinylcholine should not be used and a more prolonged intubation is expected.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The level of evidence is of moderate GRADE due to imperfect study designs and varying techniques used across trials .</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-15 05:55:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diem T.T. Tran">
<P>Patients often require a rapid sequence induction (RSI) endotracheal intubation technique during emergencies or electively to protect against aspiration, increased intracranial pressure, or to facilitate intubation. Traditionally succinylcholine has been the most commonly used muscle relaxant for this purpose because of its fast onset and short duration; unfortunately, it can have serious side effects. Rocuronium has been suggested as an alternative to succinylcholine for intubation. This is an update of our Cochrane review published first in 2003 and then updated in 2008 and now in 2015.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-10-13 03:33:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diem T.T. Tran">
<P>To determine whether rocuronium creates intubating conditions comparable to those of succinylcholine during RSI intubation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-10-13 03:34:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diem T.T. Tran">
<P>In our initial review we searched all databases until March 2000, followed by an update to June 2007. This latest update included searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 2 2015), and EMBASE (1988 to February 14 2015 ) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) relating to the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine. We included foreign language journals and handsearched the references of identified studies for additional citations.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included any RCT or CCT that reported intubating conditions in comparing the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine for RSI or modified RSI in any age group or clinical setting. The dose of rocuronium was at least 0.6 mg/kg and succinylcholine was at least 1 mg/kg.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two authors (EN and DT) independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality for the 'Risk of bias' tables. We combined the outcomes in Review Manager 5 using a risk ratio (RR) with a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:15:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The previous update (2008) had identified 53 potential studies and included 37 combined for meta-analysis. In this latest update we identified a further 13 studies and included 11, summarizing the results of 50 trials including 4151 participants. Overall, succinylcholine was superior to rocuronium for achieving excellent intubating conditions: RR 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.92; n = 4151) and clinically acceptable intubation conditions (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99; n = 3992, 48 trials). A high incidence of detection bias amongst the trials coupled with significant heterogeneity provides moderate-quality evidence for these conclusions, which are unchanged from the previous update. Succinylcholine was more likely to produce excellent intubating conditions when using thiopental as the induction agent: RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.88; n = 2302, 28 trials). In the previous update, we had concluded that propofol was the superior induction agent with succinylcholine. There were no reported incidences of severe adverse outcomes. We found no statistical difference in intubation conditions when succinylcholine was compared to 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium; however, succinylcholine was clinically superior as it has a shorter duration of action.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:50:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:50:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients who need endotracheal intubation in the emergency department or the operating room often require a rapid sequence induction (RSI) technique to protect against aspiration of gastric contents or to facilitate urgent airway protection in cases of imminent airway closure, haemodynamic instability, failing gas exchange and urgent surgical emergencies (<LINK REF="STD-Huizinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Huizinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stollings-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stollings 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The RSI technique involves the rapid sequential administration of medications (including a sedative, induction anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant, with or without narcotic) followed by endotracheal intubation within one minute of administering the muscle relaxant. In emergency situations, intubation is often required in unstable situations with the potential of haemodynamic instability. This frequently requires modification of the rapid sequence induction for the individual patient, with the goal of securing a patent airway as safely and quickly as possible.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Succinylcholine, a depolarizing muscle relaxant, is the most common agent used for a RSI technique in both the controlled and emergency settings (<LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1997</LINK>). Succinylcholine has been the preferred muscle relaxant because it has a rapid onset of 40 to 60 seconds and a short duration, lasting only six to 10 minutes (Combs 1994). Succinylcholine's depolarizing action can lead to hyperkalaemia, possibly inducing fatal cardiac arrhythmias (Combs 1994; <LINK REF="REF-Schreiber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiber 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1994</LINK>). As a result, It is contraindicated in patients with major burns (beyond 48 hours), major crush injuries (beyond 48 hours), severe abdominal sepsis, denervation syndromes (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Guillain Barré Syndrome), muscular dystrophy and major nerve or spinal cord injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Martyn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martyn 2006</LINK>). It is also contraindicated in patients with known hyperkalaemia, a history of malignant hyperthermia or previous allergic reaction to succinylcholine (<LINK REF="REF-Lebowitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebowitz 1989</LINK>). Succinylcholine use has also been associated with variable increases in intracranial pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Minton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minton 1986</LINK>) and to a lesser extent intraocular pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Vinik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vinik 1999</LINK>), and should be administered with drugs that help mitigate these side effects.</P>
<P>Alternative agents, among others, include pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium and cisatracurium; however, none achieve acceptable intubating conditions as rapidly as succinylcholine (<LINK REF="STD-Mazurek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mazurek 1998</LINK>). Rocuronium is a steroid-based non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, which has been proposed for creating intubating conditions similar to those of succinylcholine. The duration of action is longer, lasting 37 to 72 minutes with standard doses (<LINK REF="STD-Magorian-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magorian 1993</LINK>). The only absolute contraindication to rocuronium is allergy. Care must be taken with people who have myasthenia gravis or myasthenic syndrome, hepatic disease, neuromuscular disease, carcinomatosis, or severe cachexia, as the duration of action may be profoundly increased (<LINK REF="REF-Stollings-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stollings 2014</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>There have been many studies looking at the equivalence of rocuronium and succinylcholine, with conflicting outcomes. It has been suggested that inconsistencies in the use of narcotics, the sedative propofol, or the dose of rocuronium administered may have accounted for these differences (<LINK REF="STD-Magorian-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magorian 1993</LINK>). No previous systematic review comparing the intubation conditions created by rocuronium and succinylcholine had been published prior to our initial review (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2003</LINK>). This review allows for subgroup analyses to assess for sources of inconsistency between studies. This latest update is important, given that several additional studies have been published since our last update (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2008</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>All of the trials we included in this review compared rocuronium to succinylcholine for neuromuscular blockade. The sedative used for induction anaesthesia was thiopental, propofol, benzodiazepines, ketamine or etomidate. We accepted trials with or without narcotic agents.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We assessed intubating conditions using the Goldberg scale (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1997</LINK>). This is a widely used scale (although not always attributed to Goldberg et al.) that allocates a score for each of: ease of intubation, vocal cord movement, and patient response to intubation (diaphragmatic movement, coughing or bucking). This scale gives a total point value of 12, in which three represents excellent; four to six represents good; seven to nine represents poor, and 10 to 12 represents impossible or inadequate intubation conditions. Excellent intubation conditions had a score of three which means there must have been good conditions recorded by the operator, open vocal cords that were immobile, and no response by the patient to intubation. We converted trials to this scale if this had not been directly reported, but sufficient detail was available to do so. We compared rocuronium with succinylcholine by comparing the proportions of excellent intubation scores and the proportions of clinically acceptable intubation scores (good or excellent).</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two authors (JP, JL, VS, EN, or DT) independently extracted data using standardized data collection forms. We converted intubation conditions to the Goldberg scale (four levels) if required and if adequate information was provided to do so. Rocuronium was compared to succinylcholine by comparing the proportion of excellent intubation scores to non-excellent scores and the proportion of clinically acceptable scores (good or excellent) to the proportion of non-clinically acceptable scores (poor or impossible). We resolved disagreements by consensus, with both extractors referring to the original text together, or by consulting a third author (JP). All data presented were from published literature only. Exact numbers for intubating conditions were provided by the authors for <LINK REF="STD-Sluga-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sluga 2005</LINK>.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCourt 1998</LINK> are two of the largest trials conducted to date. Both trials had planned to conduct interim analyses at the halfway mark, and in both cases the steering committees decided to drop the lower dose rocuronium, as it was shown to be inferior to the larger dose (<LINK REF="STD-Dubois-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dubois 1995</LINK>). Neither trial reported the results of the low-dose control groups. Hence, the data for the low-dose rocuronium are not included in this meta-analysis. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Sparr-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Sparr 1996b</LINK> used four different treatment groups with only one control group. Only one of the four treatment groups using rocuronium was appropriately controlled for, i.e. the succinylcholine group which used thiopentone without alfentanyl. Hence we have not included the rocuronium groups with propofol or alfentanyl in this meta-analysis (no control group). <LINK REF="STD-Belyamani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Belyamani 2008</LINK> performed a trial assessing the benefit of ephedrine on intubating conditions when using either succinylcholine or rocuronium. Of the four treatment groups, we used only the data from the two control groups in this analysis. <LINK REF="STD-De-Almeida-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Almeida 2009</LINK> enrolled morbidly obese participants given different doses of muscle relaxant based on ideal body weight versus total body weight. We have included only data for the two groups dosed for total body weight in this analysis, because the ideal body weight groups would have lower drug levels than those specified in the inclusion criteria. The second trial to involve emergency intubations (<LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2011</LINK>), involved either propofol or etomidate as an induction agent. The authors did not provide separate data for the two groups of participants and we therefore did not include this trial in the induction agent analysis. The figures and tables in <LINK REF="STD-T_x00fc_rkmen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Türkmen 2004</LINK> were unavailable, and we were therefore able to include only data points for excellent intubation conditions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Primary and secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>This review summarizes the results of 50 trials in 41521 participants, demonstrating moderate-quality evidence that succinylcholine creates better intubation conditions than rocuronium for both excellent and clinically acceptable intubation conditions during a rapid sequence induction. This is the same conclusion that we drew in our previous update (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2008</LINK>). The number of failed intubations was very small, with no clinically or statistically significant difference between rocuronium and succinylcholine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We have demonstrated that succinylcholine is superior to rocuronium when either a simulated or modified RSI technique is used. There are now two trials (n = 148) with mixed simulated RSI and modified RSI demonstrating no difference between the two muscle relaxants.</P>
<P>An interesting finding in this current update is the conclusion regarding an induction agent used with the muscle relaxant. Thiopental was found to provide superior intubating conditions with or without the use of a narcotic. This is contrary to the conclusions of the last update (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2008</LINK>). This switch in induction agent of choice was the result of the addition of six trials which used thiopental in this update, representing a total of 800 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Halaweh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Halaweh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ali-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iqbal-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Iqbal 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulkarni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kulkarni 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mencke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mencke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2010</LINK>). Unfortunately, this finding will have limited clinical applicability in North America, where the availability of thiopental has become very limited. When propofol was used as an induction agent, we found no significant difference between the two muscle relaxants with or without narcotics. The failure of narcotics to make a difference to the quality of intubation conditions is contrary to research which has reported significantly improved intubation conditions with the addition of a narcotic to the induction sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Sparr-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Sparr 1996b</LINK>). This suggests that narcotics can safely be omitted in patients for whom they are contraindicated.</P>
<P>The dose of rocuronium has been thought to be important in creating intubation conditions equivalent to succinylcholine. This meta-analysis did not find conclusive evidence that increasing doses of rocuronium led to better intubating conditions. Succinylcholine created significantly more excellent intubation conditions than rocuronium at doses of 0.6 to 0.7 mg/kg. There was no statistically significant difference for the 0.9 to 1.0 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg groups, reaffirming the dose of rocuronium used in current practice for RSI when succinylcholine is not clinically indicated. It is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the higher doses of rocuronium, as there are relatively few studies which have examined the higher dose (1.2 mg/kg) of rocuronium (n = 86). It is possible that there may be a benefit to using an increased dose of rocuronium but this meta-analysis does not support this from the studies conducted to date. However, it should be noted that rocuronium has a longer duration of action compared to succinylcholine, and that increasing the dose of rocuronium increases its duration of action (73 ± 32 minutes for 1.2 mg/kg dose, <LINK REF="STD-Magorian-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magorian 1993</LINK>) which can result in an increased incidence of adverse outcomes (i.e. increased duration of paralysis in a patient who cannot be successfully intubated).</P>
<P>We include a subgroup analysis for participants undergoing emergency intubation from the last updated version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2008</LINK>). We have demonstrated that succinylcholine is superior to rocuronium in creating excellent intubation conditions. This is consistent with our findings in the less than 60-second time delay subgroup. There was, however, no significant difference between groups for the outcome of clinically acceptable intubation, indicating that in emergency patients for whom succinylcholine is contraindicated, rocuronium can still be used to reliably create acceptable intubating conditions.</P>
<P>The five paediatric trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulkarni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kulkarni 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazurek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mazurek 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naguib-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Naguib 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoddart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoddart 1998</LINK>) did not demonstrate a difference in creating excellent intubation conditions between the rocuronium and succinylcholine groups. However, these had very little power to demonstrate any statistically significant difference due to the small sample size (i.e. underpowered for an equivalence trial). In addition, two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Naguib-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Naguib 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoddart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoddart 1998</LINK>) used propofol in the sequence, while a third (<LINK REF="STD-Mazurek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mazurek 1998</LINK>) used a high dose of rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg) which may have confounded the results. This update includes a trial where ketamine was used in addition to a benzodiazepine as a premedication for particularly young children, further confounding the comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Kulkarni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kulkarni 2010</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Although the search parameters were designed to identify any articles that could be pertinent to our research question, it is still possible that we have missed research not included in the databases accessible to the English-speaking community. The inclusion of non-English articles necessitated translation which, if performed poorly, could be a source of error, especially when assessing the specific domains of risk of bias. For the majority of cases, we pooled data presented in the publications for meta-analysis. We obtained data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sluga-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sluga 2005</LINK>) through correspondence with the authors.</P>
<P>This review has identified trials involving participants from a wide age range (one to 77 years) in a variety of clinical settings, including both elective and emergency intubations in the operating room, emergency department and intensive care unit. The funnel plot of the included trials indicates a lack of trials in the right lower quadrant which may represent small unpublished trials favouring the use of rocuronium (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). However, the reason for such trials not being reported is not evident. Another reason for the asymmetric funnel plot is heterogeneous study effects that can be seen with varying study sizes, intubation sequences and study populations. More effective intubation conditions can be achieved with larger doses of rocuronium, with the drawback of prolonging muscle paralysis and length of intubation. This adverse outcome was not reported in the included trials, although there is a report of tachycardia and coughing. This review is unable to draw conclusions regarding safety.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found a significant amount of heterogeneity in the analysis of the primary outcome, which we tried to explore with subgroup analyses separating by age, emergencies, doses of rocuronium, timing of muscle relaxant, induction agent and opioid use. The I² statistical value never fell below the 50% thresholds with these sensitivity analyses, nor did the direction or size of the summary estimate. As a result, we did not downgrade the quality of evidence, because unexplored reasons for heterogeneity include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Different populations (varying from simple elective limb surgery to more complex gastric bypass on morbidly obese patients and emergent intensive care intubations);</LI>
<LI>Varying clinical settings;</LI>
<LI>Different medications in induction sequences;</LI>
<LI>Different timing of intubation.</LI>
</OL>
<P>All of these contribute to the generalizability of our results and to reducing concerns about indirectness.</P>
<P>Assessments of the risk of biases demonstrate that the series of trials included in this review are at low risk of selection and attrition bias . All but one trial was described as a randomized controlled trial, with 11% of trials being at high risk for lack of allocation concealment. The area of most concern was the high incidence of detection bias due to lack of blinding of the outcome assessor, which led to a downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate. Succinylcholine will cause significant fasciculations, and intubators who are not blinded to this effect may assign biased scores to the intubating conditions. We conducted a subgroup analysis based on the blinding of the outcome assessor which failed to explain the source of the heterogeneity in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). There were no concerns regarding the precision of the estimate, with more than 4000 participants included in the pooled estimate.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Because the original review was published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2003</LINK>), this update had to retrospectively formulate 'Risk of bias' tables, a 'Summary of findings' table and GRADE the quality of evidence in accordance with updated Cochrane guidelines. This process may have led to loss of details, now regarded as pertinent, involving inclusions/exclusion decisions made in the previous updates.</P>
<P>With the large number of possible sequences used, multiple testing can result in erroneous conclusions just by chance. This effect was minimized with the use of sensitivity analysis in prespecified subgroups. We conducted an additional subgroup analysis post hoc based on detection bias, to try and account for the heterogeneity observed in the results. At the time of inception of this review, doses of 0 .6 mg/kg of rocuronium were being given for RSI, but higher doses of 1 mg/kg are now favoured, and the subgroup analyses allowed for assessment of these different doses.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A retrospective review of 327 RSI intubations using etomidate with rocuronium or succinylcholine in the emergency department showed equivalent success at first intubation attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Patanwala-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patanwala 2011</LINK>). Median doses for rocuronium were 1.19 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine. <LINK REF="REF-Herbstritt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbstritt 2012</LINK> is a short review looking at use of equivalent doses of rocuronium and succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) for RSI. They included seven papers of varying quality (retrospective review, RCT and meta-analysis), and concluded that there are no differences in intubating conditions between the two. This is consistent with our finding in the 0.9 to 1.0 mg/kg dose range (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.00; participants = 1458; studies = 16; I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 44%). When using doses of 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium, <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2005</LINK> used alfentanil and propofol as their induction agents and found no difference between rocuronium and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg in achieving clinically acceptable intubating conditions. These results are also consistent with those reported in this review for the secondary outcome (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.02; participants = 952; studies = 16; I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 19%).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence to show that succinylcholine creates excellent intubation conditions more reliably than rocuronium and should still be used as a first-line muscle relaxant for rapid sequence induction endotracheal intubations. If an alternative agent is required, rocuronium 1 mg/kg can be used to create acceptable intubation conditions but should only be used as a second-line treatment because the length of paralysis will be significantly prolonged. The introduction of suggamadex to facilitate reversal of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants may decrease the incidence of this complication, but this drug is not currently widely available (<LINK REF="REF-Soto-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soto 2015</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-15 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Any further trials comparing succinylcholine should make certain to blind the outcome assessor to the obvious fasciculations triggered by succinylcholine. Most of the included trials assessed intubation conditions using the variables: ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord motion and diaphragm movement. These measures should be maintained to allow for consistent comparison between trials. Although there are now five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazurek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mazurek 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCourt 1998</LINK>) involving emergency participants, further trials in this patient population may reveal differences in results because etomidate is more often used as an induction agent than in the operating room. There was a lack of reporting of adverse outcomes in the trials, which should be remedied in any trials performed in the future.</P>
