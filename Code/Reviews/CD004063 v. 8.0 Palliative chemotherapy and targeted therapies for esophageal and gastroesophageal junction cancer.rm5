<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of adding cytostatic or targeted therapy to supportive care in people with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the world. Many people are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, when cure is rarely possible. These people can be treated with palliative chemotherapy or targeted therapy (a drug directed against a specific component of the tumor). The aim of this treatment is to control tumor growth and increase survival, without a significant decrease in quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched reference lists, biomedical databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, PubMed Publsiher, and Google Scholar), and trial registries up to 13 May 2015. Additional searches were run in September 2017 prior to publication, and they are listed in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 41 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria for inclusion in the review, as well as 49 ongoing studies. This review and meta-analysis shows that people who receive more chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agents live longer and with less disease progression than people who receive best supportive care or less therapy. The only individual agent that more than one study found to improve survival was ramucirumab. We found severe treatment-associated toxicities (grade 3 or above) more frequently in the arms with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent. However, there is no evidence that palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy decreases quality of life. Our meta-analysis indicates that chemotherapy and targeted therapy are effective palliative treatments for people with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence that more chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agents increase survival is of high quality, as is the evidence for improved survival compared to best supportive care. The evidence for the increased occurrence of severe treatment-related toxicities is of very low quality, while the evidence showing no decrease in quality of life is also low quality.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-21 03:37:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 41 RCTs with 11,853 participants for inclusion in the review as well as 49 ongoing studies. For the main comparison of adding a cytostatic and/or targeted agent to a control arm, we included 11 studies with 1347 participants. This analysis demonstrated an increase in overall survival in favor of the arm with an additional cytostatic or targeted therapeutic agent with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.84, high-quality evidence). The median increased survival time was one month. Five studies in 750 participants contributed data to the comparison of palliative therapy versus best supportive care. We found a benefit in overall survival in favor of the group receiving palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy compared to best supportive care (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92, high-quality evidence). Subcomparisons including only people receiving second-line therapies, chemotherapies, targeted therapies, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas all showed a similar benefit. The only individual agent that more than one study found to improve both overall survival and progression-free survival was ramucirumab. Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy increased the frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicity. However, treatment-related deaths did not occur more frequently. Quality of life often improved in the arm with an additional agent.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-06 13:39:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People who receive more chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agents have an increased overall survival compared to people who receive less. These agents, administered as both first-line or second-line treatments, also led to better overall survival than best supportive care. With the exception of ramucirumab, it remains unclear which other individual agents cause the survival benefit. Although treatment-associated toxicities of grade 3 or more occurred more frequently in arms with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent, there is no evidence that palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy decrease quality of life. Based on this meta-analysis, palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy can be considered standard care for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2015</LINK>), with approximately 398,000 people diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 52,000 with adenocarcinoma in 2012. This corresponds with incidence rates of 5.2 and 0.7 per 100,000 population, respectively. Adenocarcinomas develop from metaplastic Barrett mucosa located in the lower esophagus, while SCC develops from the squamous epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Enzinger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enzinger 2003</LINK>). Both histological types have dysplasia as their precursor. Recent epidemiological data indicate that 79% of SCCs worldwide occur in Southeastern and Central Asia, whereas 46% of people with adenocarcinomas are diagnosed in Northern and Western Europe, North America, and Oceania. In general, incidence of esophageal cancer is higher in men than in women, especially in adenocarcinoma, for which the male to female ratio is 4.4:1, compared to 2.7:1 for SCC (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2015</LINK>). In the past few decades, developed countries have seen an increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Edgren-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edgren 2013</LINK>), attributed to the higher prevalence of obesity. On the other hand, the decreasing incidence of SCC in these contexts correlates with the decline in smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2009</LINK>). SCC remains most common in low- and middle-income countries, including in Africa and Eastern Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ocama-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ocama 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Somdyala-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somdyala 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2009</LINK>). Almost half of people with esophageal carcinoma have distant disease at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prognosis and management options</HEADING>
<P>Endoscopic therapy may be an option for early oesophageal cancers, but a Cochrane Review found no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing management options for this early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2012</LINK>). Surgical resection is the potentially curative treatment for esophageal cancer, but it is only feasible in people who are fit for surgery, have locally resectable disease, and show no signs of distant metastases. Unfortunately, most people develop recurrent tumor growth within the first few years after surgery. Palliative care is the only option for metastatic disease, with a five-year survival rate of less than three per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Hur-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hur 2013</LINK>). Palliative therapy aims to control tumor growth and increase survival without significantly decreasing quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-21 04:02:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In daily practice, clinicians often offer palliative chemotherapy to control tumor growth, increase quality of life, and increase life expectancy. Clinicians have the option to choose from cytostatic therapy, which is directed at fast dividing cells in general, or from targeted therapies directed against specific molecules needed for carcinogenesis and tumor growth. The most extensively used agents for this disease are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, which are included in most combination chemotherapy regimens. However, the chemotherapy agents used in RCTs are very heterogeneous. Researchers have examined targeted therapies as palliative treatment for a decade (<LINK REF="STD-Lorenzen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzen 2009</LINK>). People treated with these anti-neoplastic agents experience fewer side effects compared to people treated with classic cytotoxic chemotherapies. The most common targets studied are the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two (VEGFR2). Most targeted therapies studied are monoclonal antibodies, except for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib (<LINK REF="STD-Dutton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dutton 2014</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-04 03:37:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies are widely accepted treatment options. However, except for ramucirumab, evidence for the efficacy of palliative treatment for esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer is lacking. To assess whether a benefit exists, there is a need for large randomized studies assessing the effects of chemotherapy or targeted therapy for treating people with esophageal and GE-junction cancer with palliative intent. In a randomized gastric cancer study, <LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2011</LINK> reported that accrual for first-line studies is very difficult because most people refuse randomization, so new data from large randomized studies investigating first-line chemotherapy or targeted therapy versus best supportive care (BSC) will probably not become available. On the other hand, interesting new data have become available regarding targeted therapies and second-line therapies. Due to the limited availability of relevant data, summarizing the available evidence could increase insight into whether chemotherapy and targeted therapies are justifiably being prescribed to people with advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal (GE)-junction cancer.</P>
<P>We have chosen to construct the main meta-analysis in a way that summarizes the largest number of studies. The downside of this approach is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of intervention and participant groups. Because this approach complicates the straightforward translation of results to individuals, we performed subgroup analyses wherever possible to investigate whether the overall result was consistent across subsets of treatments and participants.</P>

<P>We constructed the search strategy by applying a sensitivity maximizing approach, using a combination of MeSH subject headings and text words related to chemotherapy or targeted therapy with a palliative intent for cancer of the esophagus and GE-junction. We adapted the MEDLINE search strategy for use in the other databases. We did not confine the search to English-language publications. We placed studies identified after the search of 13 May 2015 in 'Studies awaiting classification' or 'Ongoing studies'. In the next version of the review, we will screen these and incorporate them as appropriate.</P>

<P>For the main objective, we identified six subcomparisons. In subcomparison 1, we investigated chemotherapy or targeted therapy plus BSC versus BSC alone. In subcomparison 2, we investigated the effect of the intervention for second-line chemotherapy or targeted therapy. For subcomparison 3, we included only interventions with a chemotherapy drug. For subcomparison 4, we included only interventions with a targeted therapy agent. For subcomparison four, we identified three further subgroups. The first subgroup, 4a, consisted of studies that investigated regimens containing EGFR-targeting agents versus those containing a non-EGFR-targeting agent. The second subgroup, 4b, consisted of studies that investigated cetuximab versus non-cetuximab containing regimens. The third subgroup, 4c, consisted of studies that investigated regimens that contained ramucirumab versus those that did not.

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-11-21 04:25:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A potential effect modifier in the meta-analyses was the inclusion of studies that included participants with gastric cancer. If the effect of the interventions investigated in the included studies were similar for both participants with esophageal or GE-junction cancer versus participants with gastric cancer, it would have been reasonable to include studies involving participants with any of these cancers and which did not report results separately for these groups. Thereto, we investigated eligibility for inclusion into the quantitative synthesis by assessing the effect of the interventions on both the esophageal and GE-junction versus the gastric cancer subgroups. We compared all studies included in the meta-analysis of the main comparison for OS (including only esophageal and GE-junction) to a group of studies that had included participants with esophageal, GE-junction, and gastric cancer, through a random-effects meta-regression analysis using the R statistical computing software (<LINK REF="REF-R-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">R 2014</LINK>). In this meta-regression analysis, the interventions in both groups of studies were not similar. Therefore, we performed a second meta-regression analysis that focused on studies reporting the effect of the intervention on OS for esophageal and GE-junction cancer groups and gastric cancer groups separately. If non-significant heterogeneity existed between the two groups of participants, we included studies containing a subset of eligible participants for the main analysis.</P>

The GRADE system describes the quality of evidence based on how confident the authors are that an estimate of effect reflects the comparison being assessed. The quality of evidence considers study limitations, inconsistent results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and publication bias.

<P>The median age of participants in the population included in the meta-analyses was 60 years (range 53 to 72 years).

<P>With regard to baseline differences, we saw a five-year difference in median age between the study arms in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2010</LINK>). In another, the proportion of the metastatic sites involved per participant was not similar at baseline: 29% of participants in the intervention group had one site involved, compared to 58% in the BSC group (<LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2011</LINK>). Performance status was well balanced in all studies, with no differences greater than 15% between study arms. The percentage of participants with ECOG-2 or -3 was in the range of 0% to 35%.</P>

<P>In order to analyze the data from studies with a mixed participant population, including both eligible and ineligible participants, we requested individual participant data from authors of studies that we included after the search round of 3 October 2013. Only one author responded and provided individual participant data. Subsequently, we decided to investigate the information from the studies that included both esophageal and/or GE-junction, mixed with gastric cancer participants, in a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of gastric cancer participants on the outcome of the individual studies.</P>

These studies included only people with esophageal and/or GE-junction cancer, or they reported reported the results separately for this group. The overall HR in favor of the arm with the additional agent was 0.75 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84, high-quality evidence), showing an OS benefit (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). On average, participants in the arm with the additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent received 2.1 chemotherapy or targeted therapy agents, versus an average of 1.0 agents in the control arms. Median OS, weighted for study size, in the arm with the additional agent was 6.7 months versus 5.7 months in the control arm. We could not include two studies because they did not report median overall survival data (<LINK REF="STD-Bang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>). Cochrane's Q test for heterogeneity showed a non-significant amount of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 5%, P = 0.40), which indicated that results of the different studies were consistent in their findings.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 2010</LINK>, the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were neutropenia (27% versus 30%), anemia (12% versus 10%), and diarrhea (9% versus 4%). Treatment-related mortality was 3% in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm, versus 1% in the chemotherapy alone arm. <LINK REF="STD-Bleiberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bleiberg 1997</LINK> reported that grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred most frequently in the 5-FU cisplatin arm versus the cisplatin alone arm. These were nausea or vomiting (27% versus 11%) and leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia (both 12% versus 0%). Seven (16%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the treatment arm. <LINK REF="STD-Dutton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dutton 2014</LINK> reported that any grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicities occurred in 45% of participants in the gefitinib plus control arm versus 39% of participants in the control arm. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the placebo group and one in the gefitinib group. <LINK REF="STD-Ford-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 2014</LINK> found that grade 4 toxicities occurred more frequently in participants treated with docetaxel compared to participants in the control arm (21% versus 4%). Neutropenia, infections, and febrile neutropenia were the toxicities that differed most between the study arms. None of the deaths were attributed to the treatment. In both arms of <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2014</LINK>, 2% of the participants died due to drug-related toxicity. Ramucirumab was not associated with increased rates of fatigue, decreased appetite, vomiting, anemia, or other notable toxic effects. <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK> used WHO guideline classifications but did not specify the grade of the side effects that occurred. In <LINK REF="STD-Lordick-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lordick 2013</LINK>, any grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 83% of participants in the cetuximab plus control arm versus 77% in the control arm. Nine per cent of participants in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab arm and eight per cent of participants in the control arm had an adverse event leading to death. <LINK REF="STD-Lorenzen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzen 2009</LINK> reported that grade 3 and 4 adverse events, which occurred more frequently in the cetuximab group, were diarrhea (16% versus 0%), neutropenia (22% versus 13%), and rash (6% versus 0%). Additionally, they reported one (3%) treatment-related death in the control arm and none in the experimental arm. <LINK REF="STD-Wilke-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wilke 2014</LINK> found that the most frequently occurring grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events in the ramucirumab arm versus the control arm were neutropenia (41% versus 19%), leukopenia (18% versus 7%), and hypertension (15% versus 3%). In both arms, 2% of participants had adverse events leading to death with a causal relation to the study drugs.</P>
<P>Overall, palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy appears to increase the frequency of treatment-related toxicity of at least grade 3. Treatment-related deaths were rare in most studies, and there is no clear evidence that treatment-related deaths occur more frequently in the study arms with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent.</P>

Overall, the studies reporting quality of life did so in different ways. Although recent studies often use the QLQ-C30, the outcomes were reported in the form of either mean values with SD, change from the baseline, proportions improved, or mean area under the curve. This prohibited a meta-analysis of quality of life outcomes. The five studies were not representative for all the studies in this analysis, as four of them tested a targeted agent, and four did not report data separately for the esophageal and GE-junction cancer subgroup. However, the quality of life improved in the arms with the additional agent.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis: effect of the intervention in participants with esophageal and GE-junction cancer versus gastric cancer</HEADING>
<P>We conducted this sensitivity analysis to investigate whether there was a significant difference in the effect of the intervention between both the participants with esophageal and GE-junction cancer and the participants with gastric cancer. The sensitivity analysis consisted of two parts, both regarding OS. Firstly, we compared the group of studies that included participants with both esophageal/GE-junction and gastric cancer to the group of studies that included only participants with esophageal and GE-junction cancer through a meta-regression analysis. In this meta-regression analysis, the interventions between groups of studies were not similar, making the comparison indirect. Therefore, we performed a second sensitivity analysis, also by meta-regression, that focused on five studies that reported the effect of the intervention on OS for participant groups with both GE-junction and gastric cancer separately.</P>
<P>For the first part of the sensitivity analysis, we meta-analyzed the group of studies that included participants with both esophageal/GE-junction and gastric cancer. This group contained eight studies and 1755 participants, 459 of whom had esophageal or GE-junction cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Batran-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Batran 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iveson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Iveson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtsu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtsu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Shen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tebbutt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tebbutt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Iveson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Iveson 2014</LINK> investigated rilotumumab at two concentrations, 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg. The HR that we used in the meta-analysis was derived from both groups versus the control arm. In this analysis, the overall HR, in favor of the arm with the additional agent was 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.05), showing a trend toward a survival benefit in the arm with the additional agent versus the control arm (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Cochrane's Q test for heterogeneity showed a considerable amount of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 54%, P = 0.03), which indicated that results of the different studies were somewhat inconsistent in their findings.</P>
<P>We performed a meta-regression analysis to compare the effect of the intervention in studies involving participants with esophageal and GE-junction cancer (main analysis group, HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.84, high-quality evidence), versus studies in participants with both gastric and esophageal/GE-junction cancer (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). This meta-regression analysis showed that there was a difference in the effect of intervention between the two groups of studies (P = 0.004).</P>
<P>For the second part of the sensitivity analysis, we assessed the group of studies reporting the effect of the intervention on OS for participants with both GE-junction and gastric cancer separately in two meta-analyses, each containing five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lordick-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lordick 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilke-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wilke 2014</LINK>). The meta-analysis of the participant subgroups with GE-junction cancer contained 538 participants. The meta-analysis of the participant subgroups with gastric cancer contained 2093 participants. The effect of adding a chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agent in the participant subgroups with GE-junction cancer on OS in these studies was HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.81; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The effect of adding a chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agent to the participant subgroups with gastric cancer in these studies was HR 0.89 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.04; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). That said, this was a selected group of participants with gastric cancer, so this meta-analysis might not accurately reflect the effect of adding a chemotherapeutic or targeted agent to the control regimen of participants with gastric cancer in general. This meta-analysis was not meant to be exhaustive with regard to the effect of chemotherapy or targeted therapy in people with gastric cancer. For more information, see <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2010</LINK>. We performed a meta-regression analysis between these groups, which indicated that both participant subgroups responded significantly differently to the investigated interventions (P = 0.03), in line with the first part of the sensitivity analysis. This meta-regression analysis indicated that the studied interventions appeared to result in an increased beneficial effect on OS in participants with GE-junction cancer compared to participants with gastric cancer. Therefore, we excluded the studies that also included participants with gastric cancer and did not report outcomes separately from the meta-analyses of this review.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-21 06:17:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review and meta-analysis included only RCTs. Eight of the included studies reported details on adequate blinding. Apart from blinding, the most common methodological weakness in the included studies was the lack of description regarding allocation concealment. Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy significantly increased OS compared to BSC in participants with esophageal or GE-junction carcinoma. Additionally, participants who received multiple chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agents had an increased OS and PFS. Although treatment-associated toxicities of at least grade 3 occurred more frequently in the arms with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent, there was no evidence that palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy decreased quality of life.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Main comparison: chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent(s) plus control intervention versus control intervention alone</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis focused on the addition of a chemotherapeutic or targeted agent to the regimen or BSC treatment provided in the control arm. This meta-analysis provided evidence of an OS benefit for participants treated with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1;</LINK> <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Results of the different studies were consistent in their findings. Median OS, weighted for study size, was longer in the arm with the additional agent versus the control arm, and we did not find small study effects.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis for PFS provided evidence of a benefit for participants who had received an additional targeted agent (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Median progression-free survival, weighted for study size, was longer in the arm with the additional agent versus in the control arm. Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy appears to increase the frequency of treatment-related toxicity of at least grade 3. However, treatment-related deaths did not appear to occur more frequently. Five studies included in this analysis measured quality of life with validated methods. Although the five studies were not representative of all the studies in this analysis, as four out of five tested a targeted agent and four did not report data separately for the esophageal and GE-junction cancer subgroup, the quality of life improved in the arms with the additional agent.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis: effect of the intervention in participants with esophageal and GE-junction cancer versus gastric cancer</HEADING>
<P>We included the group of studies that also included gastric cancer participants in a separate meta-analysis. Subsequently, we performed a meta-regression analysis between these studies and those including only esophageal and GE-junction cancer participants. This analysis showed significant heterogeneity between groups of studies. Studies that included participants with esophageal or GE-junction cancer only showed a larger OS risk reduction compared to studies that also included participants with gastric cancer. In this sensitivity analysis, the interventions between the groups of studies were not similar, complicating a straightforward comparison. Therefore, we performed a second sensitivity analysis that focused on five studies reporting the effect of the intervention on OS for participants with GE-junction and gastric cancer separately. This meta-regression analysis indicated that the studied interventions appeared to result in an increased beneficial effect on OS in participants with GE-junction cancer compared to participants with gastric cancer. Therefore, we excluded the studies involving participants with gastric cancer from the meta-analyses of this review. We did not perform any further meta-regression analyses because a comparison between participant groups exposed to the same intervention was not possible. Additionally, the sample size was too small for meta-regression analyses of responses in different participant groups across interventions.</P>

Median overall survival in the arm with the additional targeted agent, weighted for study size, was longer than in the control arm. We performed a subgroup analysis with three studies investigating agents targeting EGFR signaling, finding that these agents probably prolong OS. Subsequently, cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting agent, may decrease the hazard of death. We performed another subgroup analysis that focused on studies investigating ramucirumab and found that this agent also probably decreases the hazard of death. The two studies included only GE-junction participants. The meta-analyses of subcomparison 4 regarding PFS was identical to the meta-analysis of comparison one for PFS as described above. We performed a subgroup analysis investigating EGFR-targeting agents plus control intervention versus control intervention alone, finding a possible reduction of the HR of PFS. Subsequently, we analyzed cetuximab plus control intervention versus control intervention alone; results showed uncertainty with regard to whether this agent reduces the HR for PFS. We performed a third subgroup analysis that focused on studies investigating ramucirumab plus control intervention versus control intervention alone. This resulted in a probable reduction of the HR in favor of the ramucirumab arm, indicating a probable PFS benefit in the ramucirumab group. This meta-analysis only applied to participants with GE-junction cancer.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-11-21 06:21:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In most of the included studies, the participants were only partially representative of all people with esophageal and GE-junction cancer. For instance, they were generally younger, with a median age of 60 years, compared to the overall population of people with esophageal and GE-junction cancer. The proportion of participants with metastatic disease was 69% to 100%, which is roughly comparable to the population normally seen in the clinic. The percentage of participants with ECOG-2 or -3 was in the range of 0% to 35% in the included studies. Two studies selected participants based on tumor biomarker expression, and their results cannot be extrapolated to people that do not have biomarker expression as defined by these studies. The effect of a targeted therapeutic can be expected to depend on the presence of the target in the tumor. <LINK REF="STD-Lorenzen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzen 2009</LINK> included only people with EGFR-positive cancer, and <LINK REF="STD-Bang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bang 2010</LINK> included only people with HER2-positive cancer. It is therefore not possible to apply these studies' findings to all people, and it is unclear whether they are equally generalizable to everyone with both esophageal and GE-junction cancer. Furthermore, it was not feasible to differentiate between participants with esophageal SCC and adenocarcinoma or investigate their response to various treatments individually because of insufficient availability of data.</P>
<P>Palliative therapy that shows increased survival but without evidence of its effect on quality of life has unclear applicability. Therefore, the preservation of quality of life is an important goal and should be an outcome measure in clinical studies of palliative treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Blazeby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blazeby 2001</LINK>). Because not all included studies reported on quality of life in a validated manner, we can only conclude that there is no evidence that palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy decreases quality of life. Various validated measures are available to assess generic as well as disease-specific quality of life. The most commonly used measure for esophageal cancer is the EORTC QLQ-C30 (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1993</LINK>). This measure is specifically designed to measure quality of life in people diagnosed with cancer. A worthwhile addition to this questionnaire is the EORTC QLQ-OES18, a measure specifically designed for people with esophageal cancer that contains more specific questions on dysphagia, chest pain, and reflux symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Blazeby-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blazeby 2003</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Rao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2010</LINK> used this last measure. More recent studies often use the QLQ-C30 to measure quality of life.</P>
<P>The median absolute survival gain found in the above described analyses, weighted for study size, is limited. For the main analysis, this survival gain applies to the addition of 1.1 agents on average. Adding three agents to BSC, for instance, will likely increase the absolute survival gain. In addition, this analysis also included second-line studies for which the potential survival gain is likely less in absolute terms when compared to first-line palliative care regimens. Except for these limitations, readers may consider the evidence cited above as complete and applicable.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-04 10:01:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We generally considered the analyzed RCTs to be at low risk of bias in most domains. However, studies were frequently at unclear or high risk of bias with regard to blinding and allocation concealment. More recent RCTs often contained more useful information for determining risk of bias in their descriptions of methodology when compared to older RCTs. For more details about risk of bias, see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Various chemotherapy and targeted therapy regimens have been applied for esophageal and GE-junction cancer in a palliative setting. As the regimens in the included RCTs of this review are very heterogeneous, it was often not feasible to make a direct comparison between the various chemotherapeutic agents. The only agents that more than one trial investigated by adding them individually to a control regimen were cetuximab and ramucirumab. Because of the heterogeneity of the agents used, most information can be extracted from an analysis in the form of the main comparison. However, it remains largely unclear which agents lead to a survival benefit. Moderate-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of ramucirumab, and targeting EGFR signalling appears promising. The same heterogeneity is present in the agents that make up the control arms of the studies. Today, some of these agents are no longer or rarely used. Studies testing agents on a background of more popular regimens, for instance containing platinum-based agents and 5-FU, could influence the added effect of the tested agent on survival.</P>

<P>Palliative chemotherapy and targeted therapy increase overall survival in people with esophageal or GE-junction carcinoma compared to BSC. With regard to PFS, we saw a probable trend in the same direction. Additionally, adding chemotherapeutic or targeted agents increases OS, and adding a targeted agents lengthens PFS. However, the median survival benefit is limited. Of all the individual chemotherapeutic and targeted agents studied, only cetuximab and ramucirumab were investigated more than once. Only ramucirumab significantly prolonged OS and PFS in people with GE-junction cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy. Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy appear to increase the frequency of treatment-related toxicity of at least grade 3. However, treatment-related deaths did not occur more frequently. Five studies measured quality of life with validated methods in this analysis. Although they were not perfectly representative of all the studies in this analysis, they did show that quality of life improved in the arms with the additional agent. Overall, palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy can be considered as standard care for esophageal and GE-junction carcinoma.</P>

The main objective should be increased survival, with an additional emphasis on quality of life. These future studies comparing palliative treatment modalities should assess quality of life with validated measures. Studies should be designed in such a way that they enable the comparison of different individual agents on a meta-analysis level. Our results suggest that the participants with GE-junction cancer respond differently to chemotherapy and targeted therapy when compared to the participants with gastric cancer. We do not suggest excluding either group from studies. However, it is advisable to report outcomes separately for these and other subgroups of participants. Additionally, studies pooling these plausibly differently reacting populations might underestimate the number of participants necessary to reach definitive conclusions for each subgroup. Separate reporting for SCC, adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, and adenocarcinoma of the GE-junction would further increase the understanding of the effectiveness of chemotherapies and targeted therapies in these groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between the protocol of the previous review and the protocol of the current review</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>Besides people with metastatic disease, we also included people with advanced (T3-T4NxM0 if technically inoperable) disease, with the exception of those with locally advanced cancer who received systemic therapy in order to assess secondary resectability. We included people with advanced, non-metastasized disease when the intent of the treatment was palliation. We included studies involving only a subset of eligible participants if they contained at least 15 eligible participants, and we only included these studies in a meta-analysis if there were enough studies to perform a meaningful sensitivity analysis by meta-regression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Interventions studying targeted therapies fall explicitly within the types of interventions studied in this review. This was not specified in the previous version.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Electronic searches</HEADING>
<P>In addition to researching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PUBMED, we also searched the Web of Science, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Individual participant data</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to contact the authors of all studies that included suitable participants and asked them to provide individual participant data for studies included after the search of 3 October 2013. We did the same for studies that included some suitable participants but did not report the outcomes separately for this group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment of studies</HEADING>
<P>We included an additional quality assessment domain on selective reporting bias. We no longer subdivided studies into categories of quality depending on the risk of bias criteria. We defined baseline comparability and intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We extracted or estimated HRs and 95% CIs as relevant effect measures directly or indirectly from the given data. This was not specified in the previous version.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>In case of missing outcomes, we contacted the trial authors. If the authors were not willing or able to share their data, we estimated the missing outcomes if possible, and if not, we included the studies and described the outcomes that were reported. We then noted missing data on individuals and missing study level characteristics in the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>We assessed small study effects such as publication bias in a qualitative manner using a funnel plot. This was not specified in the previous version.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Given the heterogeneous methods of the included studies, we calculated pooled estimates of effect using an inverse variance random-effects model for meta-analysis. We synthesized the Ln(HR) for overall survival and progression-free survival as well as median overall and progression-free survival, which was not specified in the previous version. We summarized toxicity and quality of life data narratively for comparison one as was done in the previous version, but we did not repeat them for the subcomparisons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings tables</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of the evidence for each analysis, presenting our assessments in 'Summary of findings' tables using RevMan 5. This was not specified in the previous version.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>The effect modifier identified was the presence of ineligible participants in the study. If we performed data synthesis including studies from this subgroup, we ran a sensitivity analysis by meta-regression to quantify the amount of heterogeneity between the two subgroups.</P>

<P>Chemotherapy: a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body in a fairly aspecific manner.</P>
<P>Dysphagia: the symptom of difficulty in swallowing.</P>
<P>Metastatic: the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another without being directly connected to it.</P>
<P>Non-resectable: not able to be removed by surgery. This can have multiple possible causes, for instance, the cancer has grown into a vital organ which cannot be removed, or the removal of the cancer would not cure the person because metastases are present, or the person is in such physical condition that exposure to surgery would cause a significant risk of dying.</P>
<P>Palliative care: treatment that reduces the effects or symptoms of a medical condition without curing it.</P>
<P>Cytostatic therapy: a drug treatment that is directed at fast-dividing cells in general.</P>
<P>Targeted therapy: a drug treatment, often a monoclonal antibody or a small molecule, to block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules.</P>
<P>Toxicity: any unfavourable event, symptom, or disease associated with the use of a treatment that may or may not be considered related to the treatment.</P>
