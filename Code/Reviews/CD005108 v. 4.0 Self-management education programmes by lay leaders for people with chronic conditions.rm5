<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Self-management education programmes led by lay leaders for people with chronic health conditions</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Self-management education programmes led by lay leaders (rather than health professionals such as doctors or nurses) are becoming common as a way of trying to promote self care for people with chronic conditions. We assessed systematically the effects of these programmes. We included results from seventeen studies which involved a total of 7442 people with chronic conditions including arthritis, diabetes, hypertension and chronic pain. While many of the programmes were similar, they differed in which condition they were for, which measurements researchers reported, and how effective the programmes were.<BR/> <BR/>We found that these programmes may lead to modest, short-term improvements in patients' confidence to manage their condition and perceptions of their own health. They also increased how often people took aerobic exercise. Whilst there were small improvements in pain, disability, fatigue and depression, the improvements were not clinically important. <I> </I>The programmes did not improve quality of life, alter the number of times patients visited their doctor or reduce the amount of time spent in hospital. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lay-led self-management programmes are becoming widespread in the attempt to promote self-care for people with chronic conditions. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess systematically the effectiveness of lay-led self-management programmes for people with chronic conditions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2005, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1986 to May 2006), EMBASE (January 1986 to June 2006), AMED (January 1986 to June 2006), CINAHL (January 1986 to June 2006), DARE (1994 to July 2006, National Research Register (2000 to July 2006), NHS Economic Evaluations Database (1994 to July 2006), PsycINFO (January 1986 to June 2006), Science Citation Index (January 1986 to July 2006), reference lists and forward citation tracking of included studies. We contacted principal investigators and experts in the field. There were no language restrictions. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing structured lay-led self-management education programmes for chronic conditions against no intervention or clinician-led programmes. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Results of RCTs were pooled using a random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-16 11:47:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We included seventeen trials involving 7442 participants. The interventions shared similar structures and components but studies showed heterogeneity in conditions studied, outcomes collected and effects. There were no studies of children and adolescents, only one study provided data on outcomes beyond six months, and only two studies reported clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>Primary outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>Health status: There was a small, statistically-significant reduction in: pain (11 studies, SMD -0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to -0.04)); disability (8 studies, SMD -0.15 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.05); and fatigue (7 studies, SMD -0.16 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.09); and small, statistically-significant improvement in depression (6 studies, SMD -0.16 95% CI -0.24 to -0.07). There was a small (but not statistically- or clinically-significant) improvement in psychological well-being (5 studies; SMD -0.12 (95% CI -0.33 to 0.09)); but no difference between groups for health-related quality of life (3 studies; WMD -0.03 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.02). Six studies showed a statistically-significant improvement in self-rated general health (WMD -0.20 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.10).</P>
<P>Health behaviours: 7 studies showed a small, statistically-significant increase in self-reported aerobic exercise (SMD -0.20 (95% CI -0.27 to -0.12)) and a moderate increase in cognitive symptom management (4 studies, WMD -0.55 ( 95% CI -0.85 to -0.26)).</P>
<P>Healthcare use: There were no statistically-significant differences between groups in physician or general practitioner attendance (9 studies; SMD -0.03 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.04)). There were also no statistically-significant differences between groups for days/nights spent in hospital (6 studies; WMD -0.32 (95% CI -0.71 to 0.07)).</P>
<P>Self-efficacy: (confidence to manage condition) showed a small statistically-significant improvement (10 studies): SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.19.</P>
<P>No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Lay-led self-management education programmes may lead to small, short-term improvements in participants' self-efficacy, self-rated health, cognitive symptom management, and frequency of aerobic exercise. There is currently no evidence to suggest that such programmes improve psychological health, symptoms or health-related quality of life, or that they significantly alter healthcare use. Future research on such interventions should explore longer term outcomes, their effect on clinical measures of disease and their potential role in children and adolescents. </P>

<P>Note: we chose to use the term 'lay' rather than 'peer' in this document. The terms may be regarded as interchangeable.<BR/>

<BR/>
</B>Developed healthcare systems are shifting from paternalistic to partnership models of care. Policy makers, clinicians and consumers are seeking ways to promote increased involvement of patients in their own management (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1999</LINK>).<B> </B>Lay-led self-management education programmes for chronic disease may be one effective way of promoting this shift (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2002</LINK>). Such programmes are also a widespread strategy in the attempt to care cost-effectively for expanding populations with chronic illness (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1998</LINK>). Indeed, healthcare planners are making increasingly optimistic assumptions about the capacity of patients to take more responsibility for their health (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Wanless-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanless 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Self-management education programmes are distinct from simple patient education or skills training, in that they are designed to allow people with chronic conditions to take an active part in the management of their own condition. The earliest programmes included asthma self-management plans that encouraged people to alter their dosages of asthma medication in response to altered symptoms or peak expiratory flow measurements. Whilst early programmes often lacked an explicit theoretical basis, newer self-management education programmes, such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) (http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/) developed by Lorig at Stanford University, California and discussed below, are usually based on theoretical models of behaviour. The CDSMP is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1977</LINK>), a social cognitive theory which states that the key predictors of successful behaviour change are confidence (self-efficacy) in the ability to carry out an action and expectation that a particular goal will be achieved (outcome expectancy). Self-efficacy is seen as an early step in causal pathways of behaviour change in self-management programmes; increasing self-efficacy is a prerequisite for behaviour change which, through improved self management, may influence health and healthcare use.</P>
<P>The interpretation of who exactly qualifies as a lay leader may vary between programmes but they are all trained and accredited and adopt a philosophy of self-management rather than the medical model. Lay-led (or peer-led) education may differ from professionally-led education in important ways, including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>lay leaders commonly, but not invariably, themselves have a chronic disease, which may or may not be the same as that affecting programme participants; thus leaders in such programmes may act as role-models for the participants;</LI>
<LI>the format may be less formal than education from a health professional, perhaps encouraging discussion of ways of self-care that participants find helpful which they might not feel able to raise in a professionally-led programme; and</LI>
<LI>lay-leaders, particularly for programmes for specific ethnic groups, may provide subtle but important interpretations of health advice that reflect particular health beliefs or explanatory models for that group.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>A number of national lay-led chronic disease programmes have been developed in response to this work, such as the UK Expert Patients Programme (<LINK REF="REF-HMSO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HMSO 2001</LINK>), the Arthritis Foundation of Australia's Arthritis Self Management Program (ASMP) and Canada's Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) (<LINK REF="REF-McGowan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGowan 2006</LINK>). Programmes have also been adapted for use by different ethnic groups (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999a</LINK>). National programmes have developed considerable public support and generated widespread publicity, reflecting the interest of consumers in the programmes' potential to provide both a voice for their interests and improved health. The programmes also have political importance, as governments use them to demonstrate willingness to reform health services in the interests of consumers, following, for example, failures of professionally dominated services.</P>
<P>Important differences exist, however, between California, where the programmes were initially designed and evaluated, and other healthcare settings. First, California has a relatively affluent population where self-help is a popular approach to illness. Second, health care in the USA is principally insurance-based and dominated by managed care in contrast to, for instance, the UK. Third, volunteers in the USA may differ from recruits targeted differently in other settings. Uncertainty remains about the effectiveness of lay-led self-management education in several areas, notably in comparison with professionally-led education, in different population groups, in different healthcare settings, and in how best to deliver these programmes. It is not clear what the most important features of education programmes are. For instance, impact may be dependent on the duration, format, content or even context of the self-management training, or on aspects of the training and accreditation of tutors.</P>
<P>The literature is expanding rapidly in this area and a recent 'rapid' review has questioned the impact of lay-led self-management education interventions for chronic conditions, finding that their effectiveness has been over-stated and benefits gained are short-term (<LINK REF="REF-Bury-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bury 2005</LINK>). A systematic review is thus vital and timely for summarising existing research and directing further investigation.</P>
<P>Evaluation of interventions comprising peer support for people with chronic disease is the subject of a separate Cochrane review currently in progress (<LINK REF="REF-Doull-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doull 2005</LINK>). Peer-support interventions are less formalised than self-management education programmes; the content of peer-support meetings is not programmed in advance, whereas self-management education programmes generally have a well-defined and pre-determined structure. The intent or purpose of the support function is information sharing and exchange, emotional support and sharing of experiences. Whilst peer support may be a component of some lay-led self-management education programmes, our review addressed interventions that are primarily educational and primarily addressing self management of disease. This emphasis on education is reflected in the term 'tutors' which is frequently used to describe the lay-leaders of interventions such as the ASMP and the CDSMP.</P>
<P>Interventions by lay health workers in primary care and the community have been the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2005</LINK>). Interventions in that review were likely to be wider in scope and include less formally structured programmes. We had ongoing discussion with the authors of the lay health worker review, to ensure that we avoided confusion for readers in the interpretation of the reviews.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included participants of all age groups. We intended to divide participants into adults, adolescents and children; however all included studies involved adults.</P>
<P>We excluded interventions for people without established chronic conditions, such as interventions to increase exercise in healthy people, or interventions for people at risk of disease (for example, those with a family history of diabetes). We also excluded studies involving participants undergoing cancer therapies such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and therapeutic surgery, since these might interfere with the outcomes of the intervention.</P>
<P>Based on descriptions in papers, the review authors decided whether participants had a chronic condition as defined by the Long-term Medical Conditions Alliance ("an illness of prolonged duration that may affect any aspect of that person's life" (<LINK REF="REF-LMCA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">LMCA 2004</LINK>)).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included lay-led self-management education programmes for people with chronic conditions. For the purposes of this review, these interventions were defined as structured programmes for people with chronic conditions which were judged by the authors to be primarily educational, primarily addressing self management of disease, and where the majority of the course content was delivered by lay people. We accepted study authors' definitions of lay leaders but contacted study authors whenever we were unclear about the background of those delivering the programme. For example, in the UK, lay leaders in the Expert Patient Programme (EPP) may occasionally also be health professionals; however they must have a chronic illness and they must deliver the course content by strictly adhering to the course manual rather than in their capacity as a health professional (J Atkins, personal communication) . </P>
<P>We included interventions that incorporated elements of peer support, as long as the intervention was primarily educational and primarily addressed self management of disease. We included interventions that incorporated a clinician-led component, as long as the majority (in terms of time) of the intervention was lay led. We included face-to-face education, in groups or as individuals. We included education delivered by post or electronically, such as by phone or the internet, only if this involved an iterative process of interaction between the participant and the tutor.</P>
<P>We included interventions that incorporated education for carers and/or relatives, as long as the intervention primarily addressed the person with the illness. </P>
<P>We excluded information delivered as literature alone without iteration, as this intervention was being assessed by other reviews and involves the provision of information rather than structured formal education.<I> </I>Interventions described in studies as self-managment education, but which are not structured education programmes as specified above, were not included in this review.<B> </B>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Justification of primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Health status measures are key patient-centred measures of well-being. Health behaviour reflects closely the effectiveness of self-management interventions. Healthcare use, whilst less important to patients, is an important measure for healthcare planners, since they use potential cost savings as a major justification of self-care interventions. Self-efficacy is a socio-cognitive construct that is thought to relate strongly to some behaviour changes. Self-efficacy theory underpins the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. We explored consumer views on importance of outcomes during the review process.</P>

<P>We originally intended to assess the quality of the RCTs as outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 4.2.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>) and to grade the studies as: A = low risk of bias, B = moderate risk of bias, and C = high risk of bias. However, in practice this method proved difficult to operationalise. Following discussion with the Review Group Coordinator we decided to report on the methodological quality of included studies in accordance with the guidelines of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2007</LINK>). We assessed studies on the following quality elements: randomisation; allocation concealment; blinding of outcomes assessors and data analysts; baseline comparability; follow-up; intention-to-treat analysis; validation of tools; and other sources of bias. We present this assessment in additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. We incorporated the results of the quality assessment into the review through systematic narrative description and commentary about each of the quality items. Additionally, in the table 'Characteristics of Included Studies, studies were rated as having adequate concealment of allocation (A); unclear (B); or having inadequate concealment (C).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>To measure treatment effect we focused on change from baseline as this was the predominant method of analysis in most of the trial reports included in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK> section 8.5.2.9). We used the standardised mean differences (SMD) of change from baseline, because one of the issues with synthesising outcomes in these types of trial has been that many of the trials measure the same outcome in different ways, and we expected this to be the case in the trials included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>, section 8.2.2.2). To interpret the resulting SMDs in our meta-analyses we followed Cohen's suggested convention that an SMD of 0.2 is interpreted as small (because anything smaller is generally trivial), an SMD of 0.5 is interpreted as a medium-sized effect (because it is visible to the naked eye) and an SMD of 0.8 is large (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1992</LINK>). One drawback of extrapolating Cohen's interpretation of the size of SMDs to the types of outcome measure used in the trials in this review is that his judgements about what are small, medium or large effect sizes may not be wholly appropriate for outcomes which are not measuring physical attributes such as height or weight. Nevertheless, his judgements provide us with a good starting point for discussing the potential importance of the effect sizes we have calculated.</P>
<P>To aid interpretation, we back-transformed our SMDs into the measures reported by authors for selected outcomes where we felt that interpretation on the original scale would be relatively easy, or minimally clinically-important differences have been established. Nevertheless, back-transformation can sometimes be misleading and so we present our back-transformed results as illustrative only (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cluster randomised trials </HEADING>
<P>To include the results from the one cluster randomised trial in our meta-analysis, we calculated mean cluster size, m, from the study, and assumed that the effect of clustering could be reflected by an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.03. From this we calculated a design effect as 1+(m-1) and divided the sample sizes in intervention and control groups by this design effect to give an effective sample size. We entered this effective sample size, rather than the actual sample size, into RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-4.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 4.2</LINK>). We carried out sensitivity analyses by using a range of intra-cluster correlation values from 0.01 to 0.3. Values for outcomes from these types of study rarely fall outside these values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dealing with missing data </HEADING>
<P>Our treatment effects are based on intention-to-treat or available case analyses wherever possible. In available case analysis, data are analysed for every participant for whom the outcome was obtained (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Data from studies using intention-to-treat analysis (with data imputed for missing outcomes) was used wherever possible and authors were contacted if they had not reported the necessary summary statistics (mean, standard deviation and number of participants for each treatment group) for meta-analysis of continuous outcomes. Where studies reported available case analyses, these analyses formed the basis of our meta-analysis and we asked authors for appropriate data relating to these analyses (change scores and standard deviations) where these data were not reported. We intended to approach authors when per-protocol analyses had been carried out to ask them for data to enable us to conduct available case analyses. However, we found that the reporting was not clear enough for us to identify any trials in which true per-protocol analyses were carried out, and we assumed that most reports were of available case analyses. We did not include data in the meta-analysis from any trials where standard deviations of change from baseline were missing in the trial report and could not be obtained from authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of heterogeneity </HEADING>
<P>We assessed consistency of results visually and by examining I² on the forest plots, a quantity which describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We summarised any differences in a narrative synthesis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of reporting biases </HEADING>
<P>We drew funnel plots to investigate any relationship between effect size and study precision (closely related to sample size). Such a relationship could be due to publication or related biases or due to systematic differences between small and large studies. If a relationship was identified, we further examined clinical diversity of the studies as a possible explanation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis </HEADING>
<P>We grouped together studies that compared broadly similar types of interventions as follows: those evaluating the Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP), those evaluating the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), and those evaluating other types of lay-led self-management education programmes. Where feasible, the results of included studies were combined and an estimate of effect obtained. Because of the nature of the interventions being examined, we expected heterogeneity of effect and therefore used random-effect rather than fixed-effect meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK> section 8.7.4). We did not have enough studies in any meta-analysis to explore heterogeneity further by, for example, meta-regression. We used data adjusted for covariates in the analysis where reported, otherwise we used unadjusted data. Thus our resulting effect sizes incorporate a mixture of unadjusted and adjusted effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity </HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses addressed the effectiveness of specific programmes (such as the ASMP and CDSMP), and ethnicity. We had also planned to examine gender, age and partly versus wholly lay-led programmes, however there was insufficient data to allow this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analysis </HEADING>
<P>Primary analyses were based on available data from all included studies relevant to the comparison of interest. To assess the robustness of conclusions to quality of data and approaches to analysis, we conducted sensitivity analyses. These analyses included the following:<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Consumer input</HEADING>
<P>Consumer involvement comprised discussion of the results with four consumers. These people had a wide range of conditions, including a degenerative neurological condition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and restorative surgery. Two had participated in the UK government's Expert Patient Programme.</P>
<P>Two consumers were approached individually and the other two discussed the review as a pair. The latter were members of CG's practice Research Liaison Group. None represented specific lay organisations. Consumers were presented with a list of the outcomes gathered in the review and asked if the review had omitted any important outcomes, and what importance they would place on self-efficacy as an outcome. They were asked to comment on the findings of the review.</P>

<P>Overall 70% of 7442 recruited participants were female (excluding one study that did not report gender of participants (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>) and one study directed exclusively at women (<LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK>)). The mean age of the study participants ranged from 44 to 79 years. In eleven studies over 90% of participants were white (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>).

<P>In eight studies participants volunteered following an advertising campaign in community centres, health centres, social clubs or local newspapers (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>). One study used health professional referral (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK> recruited participants via self referral or referral from a health professional. In three studies participants were identified from a disease database or equivalent and invited to take part by letter (<LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK> used all the above methods to recruit participants.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Brief summary of the interventions </HEADING>
<P>The ASMP, CDSMP and its anglicised version, the EPP, typically consist of a structured course of six (originally seven) weekly sessions each lasting around 2.5 hours and led by one, or more usually two, trained and accredited lay facilitators (in a few studies a small proportion of courses were actually facilitated by healthcare professionals and/or students). The sessions cover: goal setting and problem solving; lifestyle changes around diet, exercise, and sleep; identifying resources; symptom management; dealing with anger, fear and frustration; and communication with health professionals. The lay facilitator acts as a positive role model. Participants are also given an educational manual or booklet (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2002</LINK>) or videocassette (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>) covering the course content.</P>
<P>The interventions in the third group of five studies (see above) varied in structure from four to seven weekly sessions of 1.5 to 3 hours' duration. <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK> was modelled after the CDSMP programme but was reduced to a total of 8 hours. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK>) involved a one-to-one intervention whereby patients were trained to offer peer support, either face-to-face or via the telephone. We contacted the author who confirmed that this was a self-management education intervention. In all these studies participants also received literature about their condition and in three of the studies this was supplemented with a videotape (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). All lay leaders were trained and in three of the studies at least one of the leaders had the same chronic condition as the participants. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>) a physician led 25% of the classes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Theoretical framework of Interventions </HEADING>
<P>The earliest self-management studies were "largely atheoretical" but later the ASMP, CDSMP and EPP came to be based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fourteen of the included studies were based on self-efficacy theory (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swerissen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swerissen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). The study by de Weerdt was based on the theory of reasoned action developed by Ajzen and Fishbein (<LINK REF="REF-Ajzen-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajzen 1980</LINK>). The intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK> was based on social support.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Excluded studies </HEADING>
<P>We excluded 49 studies from the review. The majority (30) were excluded because the intervention was not lay or peer led. Ten studies were not RCTs. The remaining studies did not evaluate self-management education (5), had no usual care group (2), were not primarily lay led (1) or were not structured for all of the participants (1). (See table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 11:56:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We have summarised the methodological quality of the included studies in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Based on this component approach to quality assessment, and with particular respect to the context of this review, we concluded that two studies appear to be of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>), three studies appear to be of intermediate quality (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK>) and the quality of the remaining studies is unclear. The individual quality components are described below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Randomisation </HEADING>
<P>Seven studies reported their method of generating the randomisation schedule and the methods used were considered adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK>). The remaining studies did not provide enough information concerning randomisation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Allocation </HEADING>
<P>Only four studies reported sufficient detail for the review authors to be reasonably certain that allocation concealment was adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>). For the remaining studies the method of allocation concealment was unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding </HEADING>
<P>We believe it may not be possible to fully blind consented study participants to their allocation group in studies involving behavioural interventions. None of the studies reported whether care providers were blinded but this quality criterion may also not be appropriate when considering interventions like these which actively seek to improve participants' communication with healthcare professionals. Six studies described blinding of outcome assessors that was considered adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). The remaining studies did not provide sufficient information for us to be confident that assessors were blinded. However most outcomes were collected by postal questionnaire so outcome assessor blinding would have been a less important source of potential bias than in other situations (see note on participant-expectation bias below).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Follow-up and exclusions </HEADING>
<P>All 17 included studies reported information on follow-up rates. Of these, two achieved follow-up rates of more than 90% (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>); eight achieved rates of 81 to 90% (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>) three achieved rates of 70 to 80% (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>); four achieved rates of less than 69% (<LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swerissen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swerissen 2006</LINK>). None reported follow-up rates of less than 65%. Follow-up periods varied from 3 to 6 months with two studies also following participants for 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). Three studies followed up intervention participants at 12 months, however, there was no control group for comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>A wide variety of outcomes were examined across the 17 included trials and no single outcome was reported in every study. Only seven studies identified primary outcomes. Some outcomes - for example, anxiety and depression or clinical measures - were reported by even fewer, or single, studies. From this we conclude that there may be a risk of reporting bias in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other potential sources of bias </HEADING>
<P>We have interpreted intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis to mean that participants were compared in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned regardless of whether they actually received the treatment, their subsequent withdrawal or deviation from the protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). Two studies used ITT analysis substituting baseline data for any missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-Holtrop-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Summers Holtrop 2002</LINK>). One study used hot decking to impute missing data (ie. imputing missing values by entering a value from elsewhere in the sample on some kind of rational basis). (<LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>). Nine studies stated that they had carried out an ITT analysis, but only presented data for those participants who had completed the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). We have classified these studies as available case analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>, section 8.4.1.1). In four of those studies the authors included information about the effect of ITT analysis on the results (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>), but provided limited data. One study reported ITT analysis for some results but not all (<LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK>). Four studies did not use ITT analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swerissen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swerissen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because participants cannot be blinded to intervention group and the outcome measures are self reported there is a possibility of participation-expectation bias (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado 2004</LINK>). Twelve studies used a waiting list control group and offered the intervention to control participants at the end of follow up. It is not clear whether or not the use of waiting list control groups, particularly where studies have recruited volunteers and/ or rely on self reported baseline and outcome measures, results in any bias so this was explored in post-hoc sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>One early study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>) included in our review was excluded from all of the analyses: in a three-arm RCT Cohen compared a lay-led self-management course with a similar but professionally-led course and compared them to usual care. Apart from comparisons between the two types of intervention (discussed below) all other analyses combined the two intervention groups. Results in a format that could be meta-analysed were not available for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Swerissen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swerissen 2006</LINK>) and only limited results were available for another study (<LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>).

<P>The actual or estimated costs of delivering the programme per participant were reported in a small number of studies: US$100 (setting Netherlands, published 1991 (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>)); 82.7 Chinese Yuan (setting China, published 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2003</LINK>)); £123 (setting UK, published 2005 (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>)); £250 (setting UK, published 2005 (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>)).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effects on carers</HEADING>
<P>There was no information on the effect of these interventions on carers. Only five studies reported that carers (partners, family members or friends) were encouraged to attend the classes (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Attendance rates for self-management programmes</HEADING>
<P>In six studies between 51% and 87% of participants attended at least half the sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). Four studies reported the mean number of classes attended (<LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swerissen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swerissen 2006</LINK>); this ranged from 4.3 out of six sessions to 5.5 out of seven sessions. In <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2004</LINK> the mean number of contacts with participants was 4 (range 1 to 37). <LINK REF="STD-Gifford-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gifford 1998</LINK> reported that 20% attended all the sessions. Most studies did not report how many participants failed to attend any of the classes; however, where this was reported it varied from 8% to 29%, with the highest rates of non attendance in three of the UK studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2007</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparisons between lay-led and health professional-led interventions</HEADING>
<P>Three studies considered the question of whether lay-led interventions were more or less effective than interventions delivered by healthcare professionals; two of these recruited participants with arthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>) and one recruited participants with diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>). Overall, there were no major differences in outcomes associated with who delivered the interventions. In <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1986</LINK> there were no differences between the two intervention groups other than that participants who received the intervention from lay-led tutors had a slightly higher level of change in knowledge (P &lt; 0.07) as compared with those receiving the intervention from health professionals. There were also very few differences between the two intervention groups in <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 1986</LINK>. Participants who had attended the health professional-led course reported a higher level of change in knowledge than participants in the lay-led group at 4 months follow-up (P &lt; 0.05), but the latter more frequently practiced relaxation techniques (P &lt; 0.05). In <LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK> both the lay-led and professional-led groups had a higher level of knowledge and improved diabetes locus of control than participants in the control arm, but no differences between the two intervention groups were observed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Back transformation of standardised mean differences</HEADING>
<P>Since SMDs can be difficult to interpret we conducted back transformation where possible (for two outcomes). These two examples support our general conclusions regarding the clinical importance of our results. Back transformation of our SMD for the number of days/nights spent in hospital yields an estimate of the mean difference between intervention and control groups in the time spent in hospital between 5 and 17 hours, depending on the underlying variability of the time spent in hospital which is different in different studies. For EQ5D, back transformation suggests that the difference in the change from baseline is approximately 0.0025 units, well below the 0.07 units considered clinically important (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient data to conduct sensitivity analyses restricted to studies rated as moderate to high quality for all except for one outcome; self-efficacy to manage symptoms. Although only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barlow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barlow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buszewicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buszewicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2005</LINK>) remained in our meta-analysis the estimate of SMD for change in self-efficacy was little altered (SMD -0.28 (95% CI -0.38 to -0.18)).</P>
<P>We also conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to studies which had randomised their control groups to a waiting list. Change in self-efficacy to manage symptoms was minimal and significant heterogeneity remained (SMD -0.32 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.19), test for heterogeneity P = 0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> 61%). Change in general practictioner or physician visits was also unaltered when restricted to waiting list control studies (SMD -0.03 (95% CI -0.1 to 0.03)). Sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of cluster randomisation in one study did not alter the results (data not shown (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1991</LINK>)).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of main results </HEADING>
<P>This review identified 17 RCTs examining the effectiveness of structured, lay-led self-management education interventions for participants with chronic conditions in 7442 participants. Most of the interventions shared a similar structure and components, and most were based on a common theoretical framework, but the included studies display considerable heterogeneity in terms of the clinical conditions studied, the wide range of outcomes reported, and their effects. All the studies examined primarily short-term outcomes, and only two studies considered outcomes for intervention and control participants beyond six months. Thus there is insufficient information to state whether any benefits seen would be sustained over time, or indeed whether there might be benefits which only become apparent in the long term.</P>
<P>Synthesis of the included studies suggests that lay-led self-management education programmes may lead to short-term improvements in participants' self-efficacy (confidence to manage their chronic condition). There is also evidence to suggest that these interventions may be associated with short term improvements in self-rated health, reduced health distress and increased use of cognitive symptom management strategies, such as practicing progressive muscle relaxation or trying to distance feelings of discomfort. These outcomes were only reported in a very small number of studies, however.</P>
<P>The currently available data did not show any significant effects of lay-led self-management interventions, compared to no intervention, usual care or professionally-led self-management education on improving the number of visits made to general practitioners or physicians; the number of days or nights spent in hospital; shortness of breath; glycosylated haemoglobin levels in people with diabetes; overall psychological well-being; or health-related quality of life as measured using the EQ5D instrument.</P>
<P>From our syntheses of the included studies it does not appear that lay-led self-management interventions have any clinically important effect on pain, disability, fatigue, depression or anxiety at six-months follow up (all self reported). Although our syntheses found standardised mean differences (SMDs) in favour of the intervention for these five outcomes, they are extremely small and the effects seem likely to be trivial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence </HEADING>
<P>The studies included in this review were mostly conducted on volunteers, the majority of whom were female and middle aged (ie. 40 to 65 years). From the available evidence we cannot say whether the interventions have similar effects in men. Many of the participants entering the studies reported reasonable self-rated health at baseline so it would appear that these interventions might be most acceptable to, and feasible for, those who are not severely incapacitated by chronic illness. In several of the studies (including some of those directed at volunteers) researchers experienced difficulty in recruiting participants and, in those studies that report these data, often a significant proportion of participants did not attend any classes. From the data available, the interventions have similar effects in different ethnic groups and there is no data to suggest that they are any more or less acceptable or effective amongst people of different educational backgrounds.</P>
<P>Our primary objective was to address the effectiveness of lay-led self management education programmes with primary outcomes examining: health status, health behaviours, healthcare use and self-efficacy. Our findings suggest that these interventions may improve health status in the short term, but the effect is small. Similarly, although there is evidence that they may reduce health distress, again, the effect is modest. Cognitive symptom management was increased in the few studies that reported this outcome but it is a taught component of the ASMP and CDSMP and could be regarded as a process outcome - particularly since overall mental health was little improved by the interventions. Few studies examined health behaviours other than aerobic exercise. Lorig has stated that improvements in health status are not linked to improvement in health behaviours in the CDSMP and ASMP (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>). Lay-led self-management education programmes did not appear to influence GP or physician visits or reduce healthcare resource use in terms of hospital stays. Self-efficacy, which was improved by the interventions, might also be regarded as a process outcome because at present it is not clear how much participants value improvements in self-efficacy compared with, say, a reduction in symptoms or a gain in health-related quality of life. Our review did not suggest that increases in self-efficacy were associated with improvements in other outcomes, although the evidence on this was sparse.</P>
<P>Evidence from the data currently available is not able to identify whether disease-specific lay-led interventions are any more or less effective than generic interventions. It is not possible to determine what components or aspects of the interventions are the most effective. The very limited evidence available suggests that lay-led interventions are as effective as professionally-led ones. There is currently no evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions in children. Overall there appears to be a mismatch between the available RCT evidence in support of these interventions and the enthusiasm with which they have been adopted by healthcare providers and consumers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of the evidence </HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias of most of the included studies was unclear since most reports provided insufficient information to confidently ascertain whether they were conducted in a way that minimised potential bias of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2007</LINK>). The individual studies examined a wide variety of outcomes but several of the outcomes we synthesised were only reported in a small number of studies and there is a possibility of reporting bias. Also there was considerable heterogeneity in our results. We chose to meta-analyse both adjusted (for differences in baseline covariates) and unadjusted results together and we do not know what effect this has on our estimates of SMD (J Deeks, personal communication). Finally, we are not certain how best to interpret the effect sizes for the resulting SMDs: we have adopted what we believe to be a conservative approach but we have not applied this to our interpretation of changes in nights spent in hospital. These considerations must be borne in mind, neverthless our synthesis of the findings of the individual RCTs is a useful exercise and tells us something about the effectiveness of such lay-led interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Potential biases in the review process </HEADING>
<P>We are of the opinion that we have identified all the published RCT evidence around lay-led self-management education programmes for chronic conditions. We were successful in obtaining additional change data from all but one of the authors we contacted and we obtained a partially complete set of data from a second author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews </HEADING>
<P>This study extends the findings of the only previous review of lay-led self-management education interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bury-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bury 2005</LINK>) by increasing the number of identified randomised trials from eight to seventeen, and by providing a quantitative meta analysis of the data from these trials. Broadly our conclusions are similar: that the evidence to date points to short-term improvements of small to moderate size in some, but not all, of the outcomes studied in these trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our results suggest that, in the short term, lay-led self-management education programmes have a small, clinically-unimportant impact on health status, improve two health behaviours (cognitive symptom management and self-reported frequency of aerobic exercise), and increase self-efficacy to manage symptoms. There is currently no evidence of an effect on healthcare use, and the evidence on clinical measures is very sparse.</P>
<P>Three considerations are worth noting with respect to the impact of these interventions. First, low or - at best - variable uptake amongst those offered the courses in studies recruiting by targeting patient registers reduces the ability of these interventions to reach large numbers of participants with chronic disease. Second, the finding that many participants taking part rate their health as reasonably good at study entry suggests that careful thought needs to be given to targeting courses at those with higher morbidity. Finally, the predominance of women taking part and the absence of studies addressing adolescents and children, must lead to caution in expecting benefits in these latter groups. Taken together these considerations suggest that if disseminated widely these interventions might even have the potential to increase health inequalities. Overall there is insufficient evidence at present to justify widespread implementation of these interventions if the aim is to reduce healthcare resource use.</P>

<P>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Further research is required to determine the effect of lay-led self-management education programmes in a number of areas. We make the following recommendations for future research:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Longer-term studies exploring outcomes beyond six months.</LI>
<LI>Biological measures of disease control or biomarkers (such as cholesterol levels, glycaemic control). </LI>
<LI>Clarification the importance and meaning of self-efficacy. </LI>
<LI>Investigation of the under-representation of men. </LI>
<LI>Studies in children and adolescents.</LI>
<LI>Clarification of healthcare use outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Cost-effectiveness studies. </LI>
<LI>Exploration of disease-specific interventions.</LI>
<LI>Variations in the components of interventions, for example including clinician-delivered elements.</LI>
<LI>Qualitative studies to explore how participants experience the intervention, eg. what aspect of the courses do participants like/dislike, why do people drop out, why is attendance low?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Ideally trials should be consistent in reporting relevant outcomes so that results of behavioural interventions for chronic diseases can be more easily combined and the body of research is more informative. In all cases, we recommend that researchers avoid using weak designs, in particular before-and-after studies, and utilise randomised studies. The latter, in addition to avoiding other biases, control for secular trends which are notably common in chronic disease research. </P>

Topics included were self care of heart failure: diet and fluid management, activity, smoking and alcohol; recognising and managing symptoms; acting quickly; how to communicate with the physician. Mentors were taught to support their mentees rather than trying to assume the role of a healthcare provider. They were encouraged to model practical solutions to heart failure management, maintain boundaries, help mentees adhere to their treatment regimens, and decrease barriers to achieving self-care. Monthly Peer Mentor Group meetings were conducted to provide an opportunity for sharing, problem-solving, and mutual support.</P>
<P>Control group: usual care included in-patient education regarding HF. No formal disease management program was in place at the time the trial was<BR/>in progress, although monthly support groups for HF patients were available to all.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome: heart failure self care. <BR/>Other outcomes: communication with a physician, social support inventory, physical functioning, social support deficits, acute care resource use: hospitalisations for heart failure and all causes, heart failure readmission rates, hospital days, in patient costs (heart failure and all causes).</P>

<P>Sticking to it: 6 weekly sessions of 1.5 hours. Lay leaders: limited information, they were from the community and identified and trained by study investigators. Intervention patterned after a successful cancer prevention education program, focus was on diet (more fruit and vegetables, less fat and sugar, evenly spaced meals and increasing activity) setting goals, giving and getting support, rewarding themselves, thinking positively. Weekly participatory activities like food preparation and tasting. An exercise video called 'Get Movin' was given for home use. Magnets with tear off notes were given to track goals. Each session included a 'How Ya Doin' session to discuss progress. Facilitators also phoned participants between sessions to provide and model support.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Lay person led self management group: 4 weekly sessions of 2 hours. Lay leaders: 2 per group, leaders had recurrent or chronic back pain, 2 days of formal training given by one of the authors. Intervention modeled after Stanford University's lay person led self management classes for arthritis and chronic disease self management. Intervention was designed to address specific worries about back pain, enhance confidence in self care, and encourage an active problem solving approach to activity limitations. Participants received a book and two professionally produced videotapes: a 40-minute videotape on back pain self-management and a 25-minute videotape demonstrating exercises. Intervention subjects who did not attend any of the group sessions were not given these educational materials. The book and videotapes emphasized the safety and importance of resuming normal activities and presented examples of patients effectively managing back pain in their daily lives. Materials were designed to complement and supplement the information provided in the lay person-led classes.</P>
<P>Control group: The control group received usual care supplemented by a book on back pain care: Your Aching Back by Augustus White.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome not stated in paper, from communication with author: disability. <BR/>Other outcomes: attitudes towards back pain self care, back pain worries, pain intensity and interference, disability, mental health.</P>
