Thanks for responding to my comments. You say JADAD modified but there are still scores of 4,5,and 6 reflecting the modified scale in the table of included studies.  I think that you may have changed some scores in the methodological quality in the text (although you say the scores go from 3 to 6) but not in the table of included studies. As allocation concealment was uniformly unclear I would not expect any study to rank at ove JADAD = 4! Could you tidy up both lists?&lt;br&gt;Thanks for keeping Parallel and Cross-over results separate and changing the Pedersen SE. I am happy for you to make clear the way you entered the Pedersen 1998 data as first arm as if it was a parallel study in the study characteristics. I am curious about the apparent discrepancy between the two Pedersen trials. Did the first arm data extracted tally in direction and confidence interval with the published cross-over results in the 1998 paper? It seems from your descriptions of the individual study results that the overall trial showed significant benefit in PEF so the first arm data may be influenced by baseline imbalance. Is there suitable data for inclusion of this study as a cross-over for the whole study (paired t-test results can now be entered into RevMan 4.2 using generic inverse variance for example). Did you make the first arm decision due to worry about carry over? I agree that the delivery method of Pederesen is rather different and it is good that you have brought this out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot; We demonstrated in a population of mild asthmatics, that intranasal corticosteroids were well tolerated and non significantly improved lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second as well as morning and evening peak expiratory flow) and Asthma Symptom Scores.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Our general policy is to be cautious about non-significant trends - are you happy with the following rewording?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In a population of mild asthmatics intranasal corticosteroids were well tolerated, but improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second as well as morning and evening peak expiratory flow) and Asthma Symptom Scores did not reach statistical significance in the small number of people studied. Intranasal corticosteroids may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with rhinitis and mild asthma. The current practice of corticosteroid treatment for rhinitis and asthma should continue to be delivered by oral inhalation (for asthma) and by nasal route (for rhinitis) until more research is done on this topic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;Please insert date of last search under search strategy. Results should be presented with point estimate and confidence interval (rather than a p value) and again I would be cautious about describing these as non-significant trends. I would be happier with describing the result with its confidence interval and saying that they did not reach significance. It would be equally wrong to describe this as &amp;quot;no difference&amp;quot; but if we give the figures the reader can interpret for themselves.  The underlying problem is that this is a small amount of data and possibly underpowered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;I have taken out the p values for the pooled results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for attending to the above.&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;18 May, 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The JADAD score is now ranking from 0-5 in all sections, namely in the methods of review, the methodologic quality of included studies and the table of included studies. GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) In Pedersen 1998 data were used only in first arm as a parallel study because the results in this cross-over study were provided only for the end of  the first and the end of the second period but were not expressed as combined results. There is no suitable data for inclusion of the whole study. It is mentioned in Material and methods that the effect of treatment, effect of period sequence and carry-over effect were analysed by an unpaired t-test. The results were expressed as a difference at the end of each treatment group (mean +-SEM) but not as a global comparison from baseline towards end of trial. It is indeed a bit disturbing that the result for oral in office PEF after the first arm of Pedersen 1998 favoured placebo in a non significant matter despite the fact that morning and evening PEF favoured also non significantly INCS in Pedersen 1990. Nevertheless there was, at the end of the second group of Pedersen 1998, a significant improvement when you compare the budesonide group (406 +- 25.7) and the placebo group (326 +- 26.1). This could be due to a carry-over effect in this cross-over study with a potentially too short wash-out period of 2 weeks. Another explanation would be that the duration of the treatment of the first arm was too short (3 weeks) to exhibit the full antiinflammatory systemic effect of INCS. This seems nevertheless an unlikely explanation mainly because the previous limitation is probably counterbalanced by the administration of high intranasal doses of intranasal budesonide (1292 ug in average). A baseline imbalance, as you suggested, may also be a part of the explanation, knowing that  the severity of asthma was not clearly described. Inclusion criteria defined asthma as &amp;gt;  20% of reversibility in FEV1 after bronchodilation.  This loose criteria could encompass a wide group of asthma severities and account for baseline imbalance. &lt;br&gt;The apparent discrepancy between the two Pedersen trials could be lifted if we introduced the second arm of the Pedersen 1998 as an parallel outcome instead of the first arm. Another option would be to introduce the two arm as two separate parallel studies. I am not sure though that  this can be done. What do you think?&lt;br&gt;THIS IS TRICKY. I WOULD NOT USE SECOND ARM DUE TO CARRY OVER. THE BEST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WOULD BE TO REENTER THE PEF AS CHANGE FROM BASELINE (RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE VALUE AT THE END OF ARM ONE). THIS COULD BE DONE AS A SEPARATE OUTCOME IN THE SAME COMPARISON AND NOT POOLED WITH THE OTHER DATA. IF THE RESULT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAT WAY IT IS HELPFUL TO ALERT THE READER TO THIS. IN THE END I AM HAPPY TO LEAVE THIS AS IT STANDS AS THE STATISTICAL ISSUES ARE PROBABLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE DOSE AND DELIVERY DIFFERENCES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) I agree with your new formulation of the synopsis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) I changed the formulation of the abstract concerning trends and have added the requested modifications such as the date of last search and have taken off the p values and reinserted the confidence intervals. The date of the last search has also been added under the section search strategy. GOOD. I HAVE ALTERED THE RESULTS AS NOT ALL TRENDS ARE FAVOURABLE! SINCE NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IS ACHIEVED I HAVE TAKEN OUT THE MORNING AND EVENING PEF AND JUST PUT IN THE MEAN. COULD YOU CHECK THAT YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THIS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Thanks for having removed the p values from the results section. THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6) I have slightly reformulated implications for practice in the reviewers' conclusion. ACTUALLY I HAVE CHANGED THIS BACK AS I THINK THE DATA IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THIS STATEMENT (DUE TO DELIVERY DEVICES, DOSES AND STUDY DESIGN PROBLEMS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to future comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Relook by CJC 20th June 2003&lt;br&gt;1.

Thanks for looking at these comments.  We would like to get this review on to the next submission so a swift response would be helpful with a note of any changes made or reasons why you do not agree with the comments.&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-The introduction is not adequate. &lt;br&gt;a.The prevalence of rhinitis has nothing to do with the goals of the paper. &lt;br&gt;b.The terms &amp;quot;allergic rhinobronchitis&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;chronic allergic total airway disease&amp;quot; are far from being accepted.&lt;br&gt;c.Two references appear to be important: Togias, J Allergy Clin Immunol June 2003 and the ARIA document (in collaboration with WHO) &lt;br&gt;d.The links between rhinitis and asthma should also consider biopsy studies in the same patients.&lt;br&gt;e.The very precise percentage of 13.4 to 43% of asthma in rhinitis is too precise and the prevalence of lower airway symptoms in rhinitis patients varies more widely (form 15 to 40% would be more appropriate). The paper of Corren is a review with few data since it is published in 1997.&lt;br&gt;f.The paragraph on asthma deaths is not necessary.&lt;br&gt;g.&amp;quot;Some studies have shown that INCS have some additional benefit on controlling allergic seasonal asthma in adults (Wilson 2000; Varghese 2000; Watson 1993),&amp;quot; The paper of Vaghese does not show this. The paper of Watson is dealing with perennial rhinitis and not seasonal. Moreover, there are many papers of Wilson in 2000 so that I cannot comment on it.&lt;br&gt;h.I was unable to retrieve the paper of Woods (1995).&lt;br&gt;i.The paper of Gani et al may not be reference here since I think that the statistical analysis may cause some concerns.&lt;br&gt;3-Criteria for considering studies for this review: &lt;br&gt;a.Types of participants/&lt;br&gt;i.The definition of &amp;quot;rhinitis&amp;quot; is not given&lt;br&gt;ii.The definition of allergy is unsatisfactory&lt;br&gt;iii.More details are required. A Table may be favored showing the criteria used for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.&lt;br&gt;b. Types of interventions: The studies of Crystal Peters and Adams (JACI 2002) should be mentioned and the reasons for their exclusion given&lt;br&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Intranasal corticosteroids for asthma control in people with coexisting asthma and rhinitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;03.08.03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the peer reviwers comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2a: Swiss prevalence data have been removed but world prevalence data are still relevant to the background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2b: Terminologies such as allergic rhinobronchitis and chronic allergic total airway disease are indeed not accepted by everybody. We have replaced these terms by the 2 most recent ones namely united airway disease and combined allergic rhinitis and asthma syndrome (CARAS). Despite the absence of consensus it is important to cite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2c: Togias A, J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;111:1171-83 has been added to the citation. This paper was not yet published while we submitted our draft to the Cochrane Airway Group. ARIA is already mentioned in the before last paragraph of the background and we feel that it would be redundant to cite it a second time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2d: A biopsy study: Chanez P, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999; 159:588-95 has been added to reinforce common immunopathogenesis despite some differences between the nose and the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2e: The percentage of prevalence have been reformulated in a less precise way. Corren 1997 is a review that emphasise on epidemiologic studies but we have deleted it for the suggested reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2f: The paragraph on asthma death has been taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2g: The paper of Varghese 2000 does focus on seasonal and perennial rhinitis but the treatment response is only stated without available raw data. We have therefore deleted this study from the background as suggested. We refer to Wilson AM, Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2000;85:111-4. It this study, INCS do influence lower lung airway parameters but the included population is not asthmatic. We have therefore also deleted this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2h: Wood 1995 was impossible to retrieve for the reviewer because of an error in spelling (no s). This has been corrected. The reference is Wood RA. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1995;151:315-20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2I Gani 2000 has been deleted in the light of your comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Criteria for considering studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. Type of participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3ai: The definition and classification of rhinitis has been developed using the ARIA criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3aiii: A table does not seem to bring additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3aii: The definition of allergy has been modified.&lt;br&gt;b Type of intervention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3bi: The studies of Crystal-Peters J, Allergy Clin Immunol 2002 and Adams RJ, J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002 are retrospective cohort studies and not randomised controlled trial and are therefore excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: Intranasal corticosteroids for asthma control in people with coexisting asthma and rhinitis&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;5 Aug 2003 CJC&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making the above alterations.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>It has been suggested for nearly twenty years that nasal sprays containing corticosteroids might improve asthma outcomes in people suffering from both asthma and rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids had few side effects in people with mild asthma, but the improvements in symptoms scores and lung function could have arisen by chance. Intranasal corticosteroids may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with rhinitis and mild asthma. More research is needed before considering changing the current practice of prescribing corticosteroids delivered by oral inhalers for asthma, and by nasal sprays for rhinitis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-31 16:49:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Allergic rhinitis and asthma are mediated by similar allergic mechanisms. They may represent two manifestations of the same united airway disease and therefore intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) could improve asthma. Nevertheless none of the asthma guidelines have advocated intranasal corticosteroids for asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids on asthma outcomes in people with rhinitis and asthma. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 16:49:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field. The last search was conducted in March 2004.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing intranasal corticosteroids to intranasal placebo or to other traditional asthma treatments were included. Intrabronchial corticosteroids were not allowed but a device combining intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid was considered as being a primary INCS technique and was therefore also compared to placebo.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Quality assessment for the 14 eligible studies was performed using the Jadad score and by ranking allocation concealment. Statistical analysis for continuous data was done by weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen trials involving 477 people were included. Meta-analysis for asthma outcomes failed to show a statistically significant benefit of INCS in asthma. However, for symptom scores and forced expiratory volume in one second, the trend favoured a beneficial effect of INCS. For asthma symptom scores (two parallel studies), the standardised mean difference was 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to 1.26). Meta-analysis for forced expiratory volume in one second (five parallel studies) gave a standardised mean difference of 0.31 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.65). In the parallel studies, meta-analysis of peak expiratory flow gave a standardised mean difference of -0.10 Litres/min (95% CI -0.55 to 0.35) for mean peak flow (three studies). Meta-analysis for methacholine airway responsiveness (three parallel studies) showed a standardised mean difference of -0.20 (-95% CI 0.64 to 0.24). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Intranasal corticosteroids were well tolerated. While INCS tended to improve asthma symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second, the results did not reach significance. The combination of intranasal plus intrabronchial corticosteroids should remain the current clinical practice until more research is done.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 17:00:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-31 16:49:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Allergic rhinitis and asthma are high prevalence and high cost diseases in both developed and undeveloped countries (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2001</LINK>). Numerous studies have reported that the prevalence of these two conditions has increased over the last 30 to 40 years. It is estimated that worldwide between 1% and 20% of children and young adults have asthma and around 20% of individuals of all ages have allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lundback-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundback 1998</LINK>). These two diseases commonly coexist and rhinitis is recognised as a risk factor for subsequent asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Greisner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greisner 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanisms connecting upper and lower airway dysfunction are still under investigation but might include nasal-bronchial reflex, mouth breathing caused by nasal obstruction, and pulmonary aspiration of nasal contents. Allergic rhinitis and asthma are both mediated by similar allergic inflammatory mechanisms and may represent two manifestations of the same disease (<LINK REF="REF-Togias-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Togias 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epidemiological data indicate that nasal symptoms are experienced by as many as 30 to 99% of patients with allergic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1999</LINK>). Likewise asthma is experienced by 15 to 40% of patients with rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Leynaert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leynaert 2000</LINK>). Moreover, up to 30% of the people with allergic rhinitis, with no past history of asthma, will show bronchial hyperreactivity after provocative bronchial challenge with metacholine (<LINK REF="REF-Kapsali-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapsali 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fireman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fireman 2000</LINK>). Both nose and bronchi biopsy results show eosinophilic inflammation, reticular basement membrane thickening and epithelium shedding but in a greater extent in the bronchial than in the nasal mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Chanez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanez 1999</LINK>). Recent studies identify that nasal allergen challenge induces bronchial eosinophilic inflammation giving additional weight to a common immunopathogenesis in rhinitis and asthma.</P>
<P>To emphasise the strong link between upper and lower airways, the terms united airways disease (<LINK REF="REF-Passalacqua-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passalacqua 2001</LINK>) or combined allergic rhinitis and asthma syndrome have recently been proposed by the World Asthma Organization (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2001</LINK>) with no definite consensus.</P>
<P>Treatment of rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) is both safe and effective on most nasal symptoms. Since there is a link between nasal and bronchial disease in asthma and rhinitis, it has been postulated that INCS may improve asthma.</P>
<P>Rhinitis and particularly asthma are also associated with an enormous social, psychological and economic burden. Optimisation of asthma control is therefore of clinical and financial importance.</P>
<P>Some studies have shown that INCS have some additional benefit on controlling allergic seasonal asthma in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>), allergic seasonal asthma in children (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>), allergic perennial and seasonal asthma in children (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>) and allergic asthma after cat exposure in children (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1995</LINK>). Others however have shown that INCS do not influence bronchial hyper-responsiveness in children and young adults with allergic seasonal rhinitis and asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Thio-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio A 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most available narrative reviews support a positive effect of INCS on various asthma outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spector-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mygind-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mygind 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fireman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fireman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gawchick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gawchick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scadding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scadding 2000</LINK>). However, none of the major asthma guidelines recommend intranasal glucocorticoids to control asthma (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_NHLBI-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/NHLBI 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 1998</LINK>). In contrast a panel of experts has recently published in collaboration with the WHO a global guideline on rhinitis and asthma named Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma initiative (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2001</LINK>). This guideline states that optimal management of rhinitis may improve coexisting asthma.</P>
<P>In the face of recent variations between guidelines, this systematic review aims to determine whether treatment with intranasal corticosteroids is effective on asthma outcomes, in patients suffering from both allergic and non allergic rhinitis and asthma.<BR/>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-31 16:50:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included RCTs that report at least one asthma outcome and that compared the efficacy of INCS to placebo, or to other conventional treatments for asthma or in addition to other conventional asthma medications. Some trials may be only single blind.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-07-31 16:49:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We included studies recruiting children and adults. The diagnosis of rhinitis was made on clinical criteria such as sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction and/or nasal itching. Intermittent/seasonal and persistent/perennial rhinitis were considered for inclusion with severity ranging from mild to moderate-severe. Asthma was defined by clinical criteria, typical physiological features, or American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis and asthma cases were included. The definition of allergic asthma and rhinitis was established by the presence of the previously described criteria in addition with one or more positive atopic markers relevant to the site area. These tests included the presence of at least one positive skin prick test (SPT) to a common inhalant allergen (wheal greater than three mm compared with the diluent within 15 min of the SPT) or the presence of at least one positive in serum specific IgE to a common inhalant allergen. We considered studies conducted in primary care, hospital outpatients and an institutional care setting.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Three types of intervention were considered:<BR/>(1) RCTs comparing INCS to placebo;<BR/>(2) RCTs comparing INCS to other conventional treatments for asthma; and<BR/>(3) RCTs comparing INCS in addition with other conventional asthma medications to conventional treatment for asthma. </P>
<P>Conventional treatment for asthma could include: inhaled, oral and parenteral corticosteroids, short and long acting <I>ß</I>2 agonists, ipratropium bromide, sodium cromoglycate, theophylline, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and specific immunotherapy.<BR/>Intrabronchial corticosteroids were not allowed but a device combining intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid was considered as being a primary INCS technique and was therefore also compared to placebo.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-07-31 16:50:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We considered all outcomes. Some parameters of particular interest considered to be important a priori were:<BR/>(1) Outcomes reflecting symptoms: nocturnal/day time symptoms scores and nocturnal/day time, rescue ß2 agonist use<BR/>(2) Outcomes reflecting asthma exacerbations: hospital admission rates and length of stay, unscheduled doctor visits, emergency room visits and days off school/work<BR/>(3) Outcomes reflecting well-being: quality of life assessments<BR/>(4) Outcomes reflecting airway calibre: forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) (Litres), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (Litres/min) and methacholine challenge test (PC20 FEV1, PD20 FEV1).<BR/>(5) Outcomes reflecting inflammation: eosinophils in induced sputum (x 10E6/ml and/or percentage), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) (mg/l) and exhaled gases.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register (March 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004) using the terms: </P>

<P>The literature search identified a total of 19 possible publications reporting 18 distinct trials. Data was in a form adequate for analysis in 14 of the 18 trials. Attempts to contact the author of one trial for more detailed information have been unsuccessful (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1996</LINK>). Another author was unable to provide the required additional information to allow assessment of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2000</LINK>). This study was therefore excluded from the systematic review. One study compared two different intrabronchial corticosteroids and did not match the type of comparison we had predefined (<LINK REF="STD-Gale-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gale 1981</LINK>). A fourth study was neither blinded or controlled and had therefore to be excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Bilancia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bilancia 1992</LINK>). Study design, generic name and dose of intranasal corticosteroids, technique of intranasal inhalation and reported outcomes varied widely. These are reported in the Table of Included Studies.

<P>The 14 studies that were analysed were comprised of nine parallel and five cross-over randomised placebo-controlled trials. One of the cross-over studies was also able to be analysed as a parallel study by extracting the outcomes for the first treatment period only (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were a total of 477 participants enrolled in the 14 included trials. Of these 453 completed the various studies, with 44 withdrawals (9.2%). Seventy-two participants came from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Thio-B-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio B 2000</LINK>). The other trials enrolled a smaller number of participants with a range from 11 to 60.</P>
<P>Three studies were assessing a pediatric population, 10 were studying adults and one study included a heterogeneous group with a mean age of 17 years.</P>
<P>Most trials were of short or intermediate duration with six studies lasting from one to four weeks and seven trials from six to eight weeks. One additional trial extended to 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK>).</P>

The latest of these trials was focusing on patients with rhinitis to cat exposure who underwent several cat challenges.<BR/>Nine studies were assessing a population with seasonal allergic rhinitis during the pollen season (<LINK REF="STD-Reed-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1988</LINK>; Pedersen 1990; <LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelucchi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pelucchi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foresi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foresi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thio-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thio-B-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio B 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rak-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rak 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies but <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> included patients with allergic rhinitis defined by typical clinical symptoms in association with positive atopy markers such as skin prick tests and/or specific IgE. <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> focused on a mixed population with children featuring allergic and non allergic rhinitis.</P>
<P>Seven out of 14 studies were including patients with asthma.

<P>Severity of asthma was overall poorly described. Six studies classified asthma as mild or intermittent (<LINK REF="STD-Reed-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1988</LINK>; Pedersen 1990; <LINK REF="STD-Bilancia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bilancia 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Thio-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thio-B-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio B 2000</LINK>). One other trial did not specify the degree of severity but stated that the participants were requiring inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>). Another four papers did not clarify severity at all (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rak-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rak 2001</LINK>).

<P>The intranasal inhalation technique was not specified except in two studies (Pedersen 1990; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>). A pear shaped, valved holding device equipped with a nozzle was added to the metered dose inhaler for drug delivery in these two cases. The inhalation technique was performed as follows: after a deep expiration to residual volume, drug actuation was synchronised at commencement of a deep inspiration through each nostril and then a breath hold for 10 seconds. The aim of this technique was to achieve a combined intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid deposition.</P>

Six studies assessed PEF for the comparison of INCS versus intranasal placebo: ( <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen--1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>). Data for morning PEF from two parallel studies (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>) comparing intranasal corticosteroids versus intranasal placebo in "united airway disease" could be pooled together for meta-analysis. Morning PEF declined by -25.33 (WMD 95% CI -62.42 to 11.76, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) (Litres/min) after active treatment. No significant heterogeneity was detected between these two studies. Data for morning PEF from two cross-over studies (Pedersen 1990; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>) comparing INCS versus intranasal placebo in a population with asthma and rhinitis, could also be aggregated. It found an improvement in morning PEF of 36.51 (WMD 95% CI -1.80 to 74.82) (Litres/min). No significant heterogeneity was detected between these two studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Five trials provided the results of morning and evening PEF in L/min. <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK> presented only morning average PEF in L/min. No differences were noted in morning and evening PEF between active and placebo treatments in two studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>). Similarly (<LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>) found no differences in daily morning PEF between the two treatment groups. There was a small but statistically significant increase in morning PEF (p = 0.02) in favour of the intranasal budesonide group in <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen--1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1990</LINK> and a borderline statistically significant elevation in evening PEF (p = 0.05) in favour of the beclomethasone group in <LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> noted a change in the in office PEF favouring budesonide (p = 0.01), an improvement in the mean morning PEF favouring budesonide (p &lt; 0.05) and an increase in the mean evening PEF favouring budesonide (p = 0.05). </P>
<P>Data for evening PEF from two parallel studies (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>) comparing intranasal corticosteroids versus intranasal placebo in "united airway disease" could be pooled together for meta-analysis. There was a decline in evening PEF of -27.37 (WMD 95% CI -65.43 to 10.68, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) after active treatment. No significant heterogeneity was detected between these two studies. Data for evening PEF from two cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen--1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>) comparing intranasal corticosteroids versus intranasal placebo in rhinitis and asthma patients, could also be aggregated. It found a WMD in evening PEF of 17.11 (95% CI -19.07 to 53.29) (l/min) indicating a non significant trend favouring the active treatment group. No significant heterogeneity was detected between these two studies.</P>

<P>Overall there was no consistent benefit of INCS on PEF in asthma.</P>
<P>One study assessed PEF for the comparison of INCS versus other asthma conventional treatment such as specific immunotherapy in this case (<LINK REF="STD-Rak-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rak 2001</LINK>). The authors expressed the mean weekly PEF in percentage predicted. <LINK REF="STD-Rak-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rak 2001</LINK> found that specific immunotherapy to birch pollen did not alter the PEF throughout the study. Surprisingly, the other group who was treated by intranasal budesonide and specific immunotherapy to placebo, experienced a significant decrease in PEF during week three (p = 0.01) and week four (p = 0.02), nevertheless these differences were not recorded at week five and week six at the end of the trial.</P>

The following four studies showed meaningful differences in asthma symptom scores between the two treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>, reported that the asthma symptom scores improved significantly during the last week of the budesonide treatment group (p &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Reed-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1988</LINK>, demonstrated that the placebo treated participants reported a 10-fold increase in symptoms of asthma in comparison with the glucocorticoid treated participants, during the ragweed pollen season (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover the expected increase in seasonal asthma did not occur in the glucocorticoid treated group. <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1995</LINK>, showed that there was a trend towards reduced asthma symptoms score in the treatment group when compared to placebo, but only 45 to 60 minutes after a cat challenge (p &lt; 0.05). Last, <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK> showed no differences in asthma symptom scores at the end of his cross-over study.

There was a non significant improvement in symptoms with a SMD of 0.61 (95% CI -0.04 to 1.26) (p = 0.07) favouring intranasal corticosteroids. There was nevertheless a mild degree of heterogeneity (p &lt; 0.05) that was mainly related to the different inhalation techniques, the different budesonide doses and the different symptom scales used. <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> used a nozzle allowing the inhalation to go through the nose into the bronchi, achieving therefore a combined intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid deposition. Moreover the <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> study used a very high budesonide dose, that was 2.4-fold greater than the average dose of the three other studies implementing budesonide. <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> was studying children and <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK> studied adults.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK> showed no differences in bronchial responsiveness when comparing the two treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK> showed that participants treated with beclomethasone were significantly protected from the seasonal increase, at week six, in bronchial reactivity seen in the placebo group (p = 0.022).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 17:00:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The recent WHO/ARIA guidelines on rhinitis suggested that optimal treatment of rhinitis may improve coexisting asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2001</LINK>). Various randomised controlled trials on INCS in united airway disease were listed and described, however, no clear therapeutical proposition could be advised.</P>
<P>We have therefore performed a systematic review on this topic and have analysed 14 randomised controlled trials which addressed this issue in order to provide the best possible evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in patients with coexisting asthma and rhinitis.</P>
<P>All studies included patients with a documented seasonal or perennial allergic condition apart from <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> who enrolled a population suffering from allergic and nonallergic rhinitis</P>
<P>All the asthma outcomes were initially considered but only FEV1, FEF 25-75, different PEF measurements, bronchial hyperreactivity challenges, various asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use and side effects were repeated through studies with some consistency. Data analysing outcomes related to inflammation, quality of life and asthma exacerbation were not available in the included studies.</P>
<P>All the above listed outcomes were first analysed separately and, in a second stage, eight meta-analyses all focusing on a population suffering from rhinitis and mild asthma could be aggregated and interpreted.<BR/>The outcomes that could be pooled in parallel studies were Asthma Symptom Scores, FEV1, PEF morning, PEF evening, mean PEF and methacholine challenge and the outcomes that could be aggregated together in cross-over studies were PEF morning and PEF evening. The quality of the studies were classified as intermediate and all of them had an unclear allocation concealment rated B.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">FEV1</HEADING>
<P>A total of eight studies described FEV1 outcomes. There was a non significant improvement in FEV1 of 0.31 (SMD 95% CI -0.04 to 0.65). These findings suggest that intranasal corticosteroids improve objective lung function such as FEV1 but only in a non statistically significant matter. Despite the fact that this combined result is not statistically significant, there is nevertheless a strong trend towards efficacy with four out of five outcomes in this meta-analysis favouring treatment and this result has only very mild heterogeneity (p = 0.36). Reasons for homogeneity in this meta-analysis can be related to the fact that the studied population had asthma of similar severity classified as mild and that the length of all studies was identical with six week duration. It appears clearly that there is a need for new studies to increase the statistical power to assess more adequately if FEV1 can be significantly improved by intranasal glucocorticoids.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">PEF</HEADING>
<P>A total of seven studies described PEF outcomes. Three meta-analyses were performed in the parallel study subgroup. The first meta-analysis was aggregating three studies assessing mean PEF (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>). The second and the third meta-analyses were pooling together the same two studies to analyse respectively morning and evening PEF (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>). Another two meta-analyses were performed in the cross-over subgroup, for morning and evening PEF including the same two studies (Pedersen 1990; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>These five separate meta-analyses for various PEF measurements all failed to show a positive impact of INCS. This result is disconcerting in the light of the previous data showing a clear trend towards improvement of FEV1 after INCS. These findings seem nevertheless to be valid because there was no heterogeneity in all five meta-analysis and because all five meta-analyses expressed the same result. Part of the explanation may be that PEF measurements are less sensitive than spirometry and that they rely on compliance. The lower sensitivity of PEF measurements is probably too subtle to be of significance in moderate to severe asthmatics but might be sufficient to prevent detection of airway caliber modifications in mild or intermittent asthma. A limitation of our PEF assessment is that the average of studies included in each meta-analyses was only 2.2, thus lowering the statistical power of the global result.<BR/>It is interesting to underline that Pedersen 1990 and <LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK> were the only studies to demonstrate an increase in PEF after intranasal corticosteroids. The potential positive impact of the nozzle technique, used in Pedersen 1990 has already been raised above. <LINK REF="STD-Armitage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Armitage 1992</LINK> is one of the two longest trials of three months duration. It is therefore possible that a sufficient duration as well as a combined intranasal-intrabronchial corticosteroid inhalation techniques are prerequisite to properly evaluate PEF in mild asthmatics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Asthma Symptom Scores</HEADING>
<P>Ten out of 14 studies reported various asthma symptoms scores but only four showed a positive impact of INCS when compared to intranasal placebo. A meta-analysis that pooled results for asthma symptom score from two parallel studies (<LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK>) demonstrated a non significant improvement in asthma symptom score of 0 .61 (SMD 95% CI -0.04 to 1.26).</P>
<P>Although this combined result is not statistically significant, it suggests nevertheless that intranasal steroids could have some impact in reducing asthma symptoms and it highlights in particular that the combined intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid deposition technique implemented by <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> might be of potential benefits. These findings are however weakened by mild heterogeneity (p &lt; 0.05) possibly related to the different inhalation techniques, the variation of budesonide doses and the use of different symptom scales. <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> used a specific nozzle device allowing a combined topical glucocorticoid deposition in the nose and in the bronchi. Moreover, the <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1998</LINK> study used a 2.4-fold higher dose of budesonide than the average dose used in the three other studies implementing budesonide. This specific corticosteroid deposition in two locations of the naso-bronchial airway is possibly of great importance and has not been sufficiently studied. The potential advantages include a greater corticosteroid deposition in the airways without an increase of total corticosteroid dose, a potential reduction in oral candidosis and an improvement in compliance. The optimal corticosteroid dose for this combined naso-bronchial deposition is not defined yet.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Bronchial reactivity</HEADING>
<P>A total of nine studies described bronchial reactivity outcomes. A meta-analysis could be done with three results of methacholine challenges extracted from two separate parallel studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thio-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thio-B-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio B 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thio-C-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thio C 2000</LINK>). The global result showed no effect of intranasal steroids on bronchial reactivity and there was no heterogeneity in these results. This finding is surprising mainly because the methacholine challenge test is more sensitive than spirometry and also because nearly half of the studies (44%) that described this outcome, demonstrated a reduction in bronchial reactivity after active treatment. A possible explanation is again the fact that, the statistical power of this meta-analysis, done with only three outcomes, is too low.</P>
<P>One study assessed PC20 methacholine for the comparison of INCS versus specific immunotherapy but did not demonstrate a difference between the two treatment groups. One study assessed bronchial responsiveness for the comparison of intranasal versus intrabronchial corticosteroids. After two weeks of INCS PD35 for SGaw increased significantly, but surprisingly not after two weeks of intrabronchial corticosteroids at equivalent dose. Seven out of 14 studies assessed airway responsiveness with methacholine challenges for the comparison of intranasal corticosteroids versus intranasal placebo. A reduction in airway reactivity or the avoidance of seasonal increase seen in the placebo group was demonstrated in three trials (43%), after treatment with intranasal corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Corren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Corren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foresi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foresi 1996</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>INCS are well tolerated but their overall efficacy in "united airway disease" still remains unclear. In the small number of studies reported, INCS improve did not lead to significant improvement of asthma symptom scores, FEV1, morning and evening PEF and bronchial reactivity in mild asthma. There were trends favouring INCS which indicate that INCS as monotherapy may be a promising alternative in coexisting rhinitis and mild asthma. The classical combination of an INCS in addition to an intrabronchial corticosteroid should nevertheless remain the current treatment practice in mild, moderate and severe asthma until more research is done on this topic.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further research on the role of INCS in co-existing asthma and rhinitis.<BR/>The most interesting issue is the efficacy of the nozzle device allowing the inhalation to go through the nose and into the bronchi, achieving therefore a combined intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid deposition.<BR/>There is also an urgent need to focus on patients presenting with rhinitis and moderate to severe forms of asthma in the absence of existing data.<BR/>Optimal corticosteroid dosage should also be defined mainly for the nozzle inhalation technique and in the more severe asthmatic population. <BR/>The duration of a future study should extend to at least three months to assess the efficacy of intranasal glucocorticoids on various asthma outcome and to explore potential side effects. <BR/>Further studies comparing monotherapy with INCS versus intrabronchial corticosteroids are also required.</P>
