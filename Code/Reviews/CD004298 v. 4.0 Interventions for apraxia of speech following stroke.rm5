<P>No evidence was found for the treatment of apraxia of speech, a communication disorder that can affect stroke patients. Patients with apraxia of speech know what they want to say, but are unable to carry out the speech movements due to their inability to programme the required sequence. For example, a patient may be able to say goodbye when leaving someone (automatic), but not when asked to say goodbye out of context (volitional). Several types of treatment interventions have been identified; however, we were unable to find any clinical trials of these.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Apraxia of speech is a communication disorder that can affect stroke patients. Several different intervention strategies are undertaken by speech and language therapists working with this patient group.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether therapeutic interventions improve functional speech in stroke patients with apraxia of speech and which individual therapeutic interventions are effective.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched May 2004). In addition, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 4, 2003); MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004); EMBASE (1980 to April 2004); CINAHL (1982 to April 2004); PsycINFO (1974 to April 2004); the National Research Register (searched April 2004); and Current Controlled Trials Register (searched May 2004). We reviewed reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors and researchers in an effort to identify published and unpublished trials.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We sought to include randomised controlled trials of non-drug interventions for adults with apraxia of speech following a stroke where the primary outcome was functional speech at six months follow up. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One author searched the titles, abstracts and keywords. Two authors examined the abstracts that might meet the inclusion criteria. Four authors were available to assess trial quality and to extract data from eligible studies. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No trials were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for apraxia of speech. There is a need for high quality randomised trials to be undertaken in this area. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 10:42:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-26 10:32:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The World Health Organization has defined stroke as 'a syndrome of rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than vascular in origin' (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1978</LINK>). Stroke is the biggest cause of severe disability in England and Wales (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1996</LINK>) with 100,000 first strokes occurring each year (<LINK REF="REF-Blais-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blais 1994</LINK>). Stroke can affect people's physical, sensory and cognitive abilities (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apraxia is the broad label used to refer to the underlying neuropsychological deficits that can affect stroke (and other neurological) patients in their performance of skilled voluntary movements of various parts of the body, for example, limb apraxia and oral apraxia (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak 1995</LINK>). Apraxia can affect the performance of everyday activities such as self-care (washing or cooking) and communicating with others (using the telephone or writing) in the home or broader community settings such as leisure and employment. A commonly-used definition of the apraxias is 'disorders of the execution of learned movement which cannot be accounted for by either weakness, incoordination, or sensory loss, or by incomprehension of or inattention to command' (<LINK REF="REF-Geschwind-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geschwind 1975</LINK>). Oral apraxia is defined as the 'inability to efficiently and immediately produce oral movements on verbal command and/or imitation with preserved ability to produce similar actions semi-automatically' (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 1985</LINK>). These oral movements, such as blowing a kiss, may be unrelated to speech.</P>
<P>Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a communication disorder usually treated by speech and language therapists. In AOS speech sounds are made in an erratic way in the absence of muscle weakness. There is considerable controversy in the literature about how to define and assess AOS in order to plan rehabilitation interventions. Traditionally, AOS has been thought of as a disorder of motor programming, 'an articulatory disorder resulting from impairment, due to brain damage, of the capacity to program the positioning of speech musculature for the volitional production of phonemes and the sequencing of muscle movements for the production of words' (<LINK REF="REF-Darley-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darley 1975</LINK>). However, there has been heated debate over the last 30 years about its true nature (<LINK REF="REF-Code-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Code 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2000</LINK>) and currently there is no universally agreed definition of AOS. Definitions of AOS have been evolving within different theoretical frameworks: behavioural, cognitive and neuro-anatomical (<LINK REF="REF-Croot-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croot 2002</LINK>), acoustic and phonetic-perceptual (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2000</LINK>). Despite the high level of theoretical interest it is unclear to what extent each framework is useful in differential diagnosis with other communication impairments such as aphasia and dysarthria.</P>
<P>A further challenge to research in this area is that AOS is often accompanied by other linguistic (aphasia) and motor execution (dysarthria) disorders. Interested readers are referred to the Cochrane systematic reviews of aphasia (Greener 2003) and dysarthria (<LINK REF="REF-Sellars-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellars 2003</LINK>). AOS is believed to commonly co-occur with aphasia, which may also result in sound errors in speech (phonemic paraphasias), but many studies fail to describe the way in which aphasia and AOS coexist. The Apraxia Battery for Adults (ABA) (<LINK REF="REF-Dabul-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dabul 2000</LINK>) has been used in some studies in diagnosing AOS (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Towne-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towne 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waters-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 1992</LINK>). However, the ABA does not discriminate between aphasic (phonological) impairments and AOS, and its standardisation is limited. Moreover, few published tests for dysarthria and aphasia are specific about differential diagnosis of these disorders from AOS.</P>
<P>Although there is so much theoretical debate and no commonly agreed definition it has recently been demonstrated that speech and language therapists working in clinical practice can make highly reliable diagnostic and severity decisions about AOS (<LINK REF="REF-Mumby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mumby 2005</LINK>). Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were both high even though therapists in this study only viewed a brief video clip and did not have access to any assessment results. We would argue that this is support for the belief that therapists in clinical practice recognise the difficulties experienced by people with AOS. There are core symptoms that consistently form part of the diagnostic description. These have been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Code-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Code 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeil-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeil 2000</LINK>) and include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>effortful 'groping' for articulatory postures and therefore difficulty forming the correct orofacial position to produce the correct sound;</LI>
<LI>more consonant than vowel errors occur as the consonant part of the word is more difficult to produce;</LI>
<LI>inconsistent or variable errors occur therefore each attempt at the word could produce a different result;</LI>
<LI>production of words or speech sounds or both that approximate the target word and therefore the word may sound similar to the target but not the same;</LI>
<LI>difficulty producing adjacent consonants, for example inserting additional vowel sounds; and</LI>
<LI>awareness of errors.</LI>
</UL>
<P>People with AOS tend to know what they want to say, but appear unable to carry out the speech motor action. As in other apraxias there appears to be a disparity between automatic and volitional behaviour. For example, a patient may be able to say goodbye when leaving the company of someone (automatic), but not when asked to say goodbye out of context (volitional).They are unable easily to position their articulators (the points in the vocal tract involved in producing sounds). Instead articulatory 'groping' occurs, often with perseveration (repeated production of the same sound) and the correct word may not be produced.</P>
<P>Several types of treatment interventions for apraxia of speech have been listed (<LINK REF="REF-Square_x002d_Storer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Square-Storer 1989</LINK>). Therapy in severe cases may start by focusing on non-speech movements (oral apraxia) before focusing on speech sounds (apraxia of speech). Treatment techniques include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>prompts for restructuring oral muscular phonetic targets (PROMPT): the therapist places their fingers on the face and neck to give feedback about the articulatory position required for specific speech sounds;</LI>
<LI>phonetic derivation: shaping of sounds based on their non-speech postures or action plans or both, for example putting the lips together and then blowing to prepare for the production of p and b sounds;</LI>
<LI>phonetic placement: targets the segmental level of production, the focus being the position of the articulator. Clinicians use models, drawing, verbal descriptions and physical manipulation to demonstrate how a speech sound is produced;</LI>
<LI>key word: the patient is enabled to consistently produce a core vocabulary and when successful the core vocabulary is expanded by using similar words;</LI>
<LI>phonetic placements or minimal pairs or both: speech stimuli are established that vary minimally relative to features such as manner, place and voicing;</LI>
<LI>voluntary control of involuntary utterances (VCIU): the patient learns to control when they verbalise their utterances (repeated sounds) using a visual-verbal model;</LI>
<LI>multiple input phoneme therapy (MIPT): patients control when the utterances are produced using an auditory-verbal approach;</LI>
<LI>prosodic therapy: therapists work on the rate, stress and intonation of a word or utterance.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Unfortunately there is no current expert opinion to support therapy for AOS. Although they cover speech disorders and mention articulatory dyspraxia , neither the Royal College of Physicians of London's Clinical Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-IWP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IWP 2004</LINK>) nor the Scottish Clinical Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2002</LINK>) make specific recommendations for therapy for AOS.</P>
<P>There are no good epidemiological data on the prevalence of apraxia of speech, no doubt due to the challenges described above. However, it has been described as 'not infrequent' (<LINK REF="REF-Varley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varley 2001</LINK>) and, despite the lack of good data, AOS is a communication disorder treated by speech and language therapists in clinical practice. The evidence suggests that it occurs following a lesion of the language-dominant hemisphere (<LINK REF="REF-McNeil-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeil 2000</LINK>). In this review we shall confine the discussion of apraxia to that affecting speech. Oral apraxia will be included only if it is concurrent with apraxia of speech.</P>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether therapeutic interventions improve functional speech in stroke patients with apraxia of speech and which individual therapeutic interventions are effective.<BR/>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-26 10:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We planned to include randomised controlled trials of interventions for stroke patients with apraxia of speech with or without oral apraxia. We aimed to exclude second and subsequent phases of cross-over trials from analysis, as the design would not be appropriate in this context. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The review was confined to adults with apraxia of speech identified by the original authors following a stroke. Adults with oral apraxia or other speech difficulties, for example aphasia, were included only if they also had apraxia of speech. Trials that included participants whose deficits were the result of head trauma, brain tumour or other brain damage were excluded unless a subgroup of stroke patients were identified for whom there were separate results, or more than 75% of patients in the sample were stroke patients. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials were included if a comparison were made between an active treatment group that received one of the various apraxia of speech interventions versus a control group that received either an alternative apraxia of speech intervention, placebo or none. Possible treatment interventions included: PROMPT, phonetic derivation, phonetic placement, key word, minimal pairs, VCIU, MIPT and prosodic therapy. Trials including a combination of drug and therapy were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome was functional speech at the latest follow up within six months after therapy. We planned to use recognised measures, for example The Communicative Effectiveness Index CETI (<LINK REF="REF-Lomas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lomas 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes were as follows.<BR/>(1) Functional speech at the scheduled end of intervention. Recognised measures, for example the Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI) (<LINK REF="REF-Lomas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lomas 1989</LINK>), were used.<BR/>(2) The amount of connected speech at the scheduled end of the intervention; for example, on picture description, 'Cookie Theft' (<LINK REF="REF-Goodglass-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodglass 1983</LINK>). In the absence of this, single-word level was used; for example, the Boston Naming Test (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1983</LINK>).<BR/>(3) The amount of connected speech at six months after therapy.<BR/>(4) Quality of speech at six months after therapy was measured using intelligibility tests, for example the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (<LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1981</LINK>). In the absence of this, measures of accuracy were used (per cent of consonants correct).<BR/>(5) The quality of speech at the scheduled end of the intervention.<BR/>(6) Non-verbal communication.<BR/>(7) Mood.<BR/>(8) Quality of life measures.<BR/>(9) Adverse events.<BR/>(10) Effects on family and carer, for example stress, illness, and carer's mood.<BR/>(11) Carer and family perceptions of outcome.<BR/>(12) Financial costs, for example cost effectiveness and cost benefit.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register which was last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator on 11 May 2004. We also searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 4, 2003); MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004); EMBASE (1980 to April 2004); CINAHL (1982 to April 2004); PsycINFO (1974 to April 2004); the National Research Register (searched April 2004); and Current Controlled Trials Register (http://www.controlled-trials.com/) (searched May 2004) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We had planned to handsearch a number of relevant journals. However, after checking the Master List of journals that is searched by The Cochrane Collaboration (http://www.cochrane.us/masterlist.asp), we found that the selected journals had already been handsearched. The resulting trials would, therefore, be found from our search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and we did not wish to duplicate effort.</P>
<P>We searched the reference lists of all relevant references.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis </HEADING>
<P>Our agreed protocol was that our primary analysis would pool all therapeutic studies of active intervention versus control or no treatment to address our first objective. To address our second objective, we planned to analyse subgroups of studies categorised according to therapeutic approach, as outlined under 'Types of interventions'. This would include a comparison of each approach versus control or no treatment, as well as direct comparisons of different approaches.</P>
<P>Speech production scales (accuracy and intelligibility) and other ordinal scales were to be treated as continuous outcomes unless and until accepted meta-analytic techniques for ordinal outcome data became available. If two measures of the same construct were presented we would favour the more widely-recognised measure. If changes from baseline were recorded we planned to use these data. Means and standard deviations were to be abstracted, calculated or requested. For practical reasons, deaths were to be excluded from outcomes that were treated as continuous. It was envisaged that the death rates between the two groups would be low and similar because studies would only have included patients who were well enough to undergo rehabilitation for AOS. Any imbalance in death rates between the groups would be discussed, including descriptive consideration of whether analyses of raw data from individual trials could alter conclusions.</P>
<P>Where possible, results for continuous outcomes were to be combined using weighted mean difference by a fixed-effect model. However, it was anticipated that studies would use different scales to measure the same underlying constructs. If this were the case, the standardised mean difference would be used. Results for binary outcomes were to be combined using the Peto-modified odds ratio, and translated to risk differences across the observed range of control group rates for reporting purposes. We planned to note and discuss statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We aimed to carry out sensitivity analyses on the primary outcome. These would include use of a random-effects analysis, omission of studies that did not describe an adequate method of allocation concealment, and imputing values for missing data if appropriate.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The literature search identified around 1000 titles. There was considerable duplication as many were found in each of the databases. Most were not relevant to interventions for AOS. If the title clearly identified a study that was not relevant to AOS it was discarded at that point. Abstracts of the remaining articles were screened for inclusion or exclusion; however, no article met the inclusion criteria. Therefore, there were no full articles on which we could conduct quality assessment, data extraction or data analysis. We did not identify any non-English language titles but would seek translation of any that result from updated searches. <BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-26 10:34:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Apraxia of speech occurs following stroke and other neurological conditions. Speech and language therapists use many differing treatment techniques in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Square_x002d_Storer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Square-Storer 1989</LINK>) yet there are no recommendations for therapy in either of two recent Clinical Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-IWP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IWP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2002</LINK>). Despite conducting a comprehensive literature search that resulted in thousands of 'hits', there is currently no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the therapeutic approach or management for AOS after stroke. We feel that our broad search strategy would have identified any eligible studies that existed and that this is not a false negative finding. Instead, it is likely that the controversy surrounding the definition, and even the existence, of AOS may have prevented people from attempting trials. </P>
<P>Despite the lack of randomised trials, there is a large body of literature on the theoretical basis of AOS, much of it hypothesising on its relationship with aphasia. Whilst apraxia itself is a recognised disabling condition (affecting skilled voluntary movements such as dressing and manual manipulation of everyday household objects) the possibility that apraxia might affect speech production is more controversial. This is likely to be complicated by the co-occurrence of AOS and aphasia, as therapists and researchers express concerns that it is not possible to differentially diagnose AOS. We recently conducted a study that found high levels of agreement (both intra-rater and inter-rater reliability) between four speech and language therapists who independently diagnosed the presence or absence of AOS in a sample of 42 stroke patients with communication problems (<LINK REF="REF-Mumby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mumby 2005</LINK>). Therapists were not provided with any specific definition of AOS but were asked to use their clinical judgement when viewing video tapes of structured communication situations. Kappa values were high and this finding showed that despite the controversy in the literature, therapists can make reliable differential diagnoses of AOS using clinical judgement. </P>
<P>We do wish to acknowledge that there may be evidence from randomised trials in other non-progressive clinical populations, such as those with traumatic brain injury. Our review was restricted to stroke but we now feel that future revisions should be expanded to include non-progressive neurological conditions. There is also a possible <I>indirect </I>source of randomised trial evidence on AOS; that it may be implicitly included within trials of other communication difficulties, for example aphasia, and to a lesser extent dysarthria. In clinical practice it is likely that therapists treat AOS as part of the overall communication intervention and not in isolation. However, this review did not find that any of the aphasia or dysarthria trials were eligible for inclusion and so it is unsafe to extrapolate from them to AOS. Furthermore, both aphasia (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 1999</LINK>) and dysarthria (<LINK REF="REF-Sellars-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellars 2003</LINK>) have been thoroughly systematically reviewed and both concluded there were no trials of sufficient quality to guide practice. </P>
<P>To ensure that best practice is implemented, good quality randomised trials need to be funded to evaluate the treatment approaches most commonly used for AOS. However, there is considerable resistance within speech and language therapy to the use of randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Pring-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pring 2004</LINK>). Whilst there are certain clinical questions about AOS that cannot be answered by a randomised trial there are others that can, including questions of clinical and cost effectiveness. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Rehabilitation approaches to apraxia of speech following stroke have yet to be supported or refuted by randomised trials. Interested parties could source general guidance on current practice for communication disorders after stroke from the National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke (<LINK REF="REF-IWP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IWP 2004</LINK>), the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (<LINK REF="REF-RCSLT-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCSLT 2004</LINK>), and expert opinion. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-26 10:42:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Apraxia of speech is a condition with a range of manifestations and severity, and research continues to address theoretical questions about its nature and underlying impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 2003</LINK>). Different severities may require different types (rather than simply different intensities or 'dosage') of intervention, depending on the functional outcome targeted (for example, more intelligible speech overall, intelligible production of a core vocabulary, non-speech communication alternatives). This review supports the need for randomised trials that compare potentially appropriate interventions for carefully selected groups of people with apraxia after stroke. As effectiveness has not yet been demonstrated for any of the individual therapy approaches, an attention control comparator should be included. Trials should be sufficiently large to identify clinically-relevant effects in functional communication. The therapeutic strategies, the pattern or severity of apraxia and the various stages post stroke need to be clearly defined. Trials should follow the Medical Research Council's guidelines for evaluating complex interventions, which include pre-clinical work or theoretical work and modelling (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2000</LINK>). Key stakeholders should be included in planning future randomised trials, including service users and service providers.</P>
<P>Funding bodies and researchers should consider that it may be more cost effective to conduct a trial of AOS for non-progressive conditions rather than restricting it to stroke alone. This would also increase the likelihood of recruiting the large numbers likely to be needed for an adequately-powered trial. However, it would first be necessary to extend the current review to include the evidence from trials of other non-progressive conditions, such as traumatic brain injury and encephalitis.</P>
<P>Another possibility for funders to consider is to include AOS within a trial of intervention for other communication disorders, for example aphasia. The rationale for doing this is that it probably reflects what happens in clinical practice. However, it would require careful assessment for eligibility, development of an AOS intervention procedure, and planned subgroup analyses so that the evidence for AOS could be extracted from the overall evidence collected. The UK's Department of Health has recently funded a major study that includes a randomised trial of speech and language therapy intervention for aphasia and dysarthria after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-ACT-NoW-Study" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACT NoW Study</LINK>). Unfortunately, the commissioning brief excluded AOS and other common communication problems such as the acquired dyslexias and was restricted to the areas that had already been systematically reviewed. This last point highlights our belief that systematic reviews should be conducted where there is a clinical need even if the authors are not aware of any trials before they begin. Cochrane publications can be a powerful way of generating interest from funding bodies, as the aphasia and dysarthria reviews clearly demonstrate.</P>
