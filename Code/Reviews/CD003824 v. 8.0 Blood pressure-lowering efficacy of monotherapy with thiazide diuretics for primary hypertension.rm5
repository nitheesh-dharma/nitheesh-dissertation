<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-27 18:45:47 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Thiazide diuretics are a class of drugs commonly recommended as first-line treatment for raised blood pressure because they significantly reduce death, stroke and heart attacks. This class includes bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide and metolazone. We asked by how much does this class of drugs lower blood pressure and whether there is a difference between individual drugs within the class. We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had assessed this question. The data included in this review was up to date as of February 2014.</P>
<P>We found 60 trials that randomly assigned 11,282 adult participants, mean age 55 years, 53% male and 47% female, with blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg (mean blood pressure 158/99 mmHg) to take one of six thiazide diuretics or placebo for an average duration of eight weeks. Most of the trials (82%) were published before the year 2000 and most were found to have a high risk of bias in the adverse effect data. Co-morbidities were not reported in most trials. The blood pressure-lowering effect was modest. Thiazide diuretics reduced blood pressure by 9 points in the upper number (called systolic blood pressure) and 4 points in the lower number (called diastolic blood pressure). Different thiazide drugs have similar effects in lowering blood pressure and thiazides lower systolic blood pressure more than other classes of antihypertensive drugs.</P>
<P>This review could not provide a valid estimate of short-term harms from all thiazide diuretics because there was incomplete reporting of metabolic effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol and triglycerides) and the number of participants who dropped out of the trials due to adverse drug effects. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:19:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-05-27 18:18:54 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 18:27:46 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.</P>
<P>In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.</P>
<P>Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.</P>
<P>In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.</P>
<P>Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:29:10 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:29:49 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Hypertension is a common and potentially serious problem. It is one of the risk factors for stroke, heart and blood vessel disease, kidney disease and early death that can most easily be reduced by treatment. Studies show a correlation between elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure and increased risk of stroke, heart failure, renal disease and coronary heart disease. There is considerable evidence that antihypertensive drugs reduce death, stroke and heart disease when given to people with moderate to severe hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Musini-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>). However, the magnitude of blood pressure reduction does not always parallel a reduction in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity. Other factors independent of blood pressure reduction may contribute to the beneficial and harmful effects of drug treatment. Nonetheless, the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is often considered an important surrogate or indicator of the likelihood that people will benefit from drug treatment.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 18:48:33 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Thiazide diuretics were developed during the 1950s, when chemists and physiologists tested derivatives of sulfonamide-based carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with the goal of discovering drugs that enhance the excretion of sodium with chloride rather than sodium bicarbonate. Thiazide diuretics have been widely used as pharmacological agents for the treatment of hypertension for over five decades. The members of this drug class are derived from benzothiadiazine. Drugs with a similar pharmacologic action on the kidney that do not have the thiazide chemical structure, such as indapamide, chlorthalidone and metolazone, are termed 'thiazide-like diuretics'. Metolazone is a quinazoline. Chemically, metolazone is not a substitute for benzothiadiazine but it, and other drugs such as indapamide, act on the same co-transporter in the kidney as thiazides. Therefore, they are appropriately grouped with thiazide diuretics despite not being thiazides themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Edwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwin 2006</LINK>). In this review, we use the term 'thiazide' to encompass thiazides and 'thiazide-like' diuretics including the following drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, buthiazide, bendroflumethiazide, hydroflumethiazide, trichlormethiazide, methyclothiazide, polythiazide, cyclothiazide, cyclopenthiazide, chlorthalidone, metolazone, quinethazone, fenquizone, clorexolone, clopamide, indapamide, diapamide, isodapamide, mefruside and xipamide. Thiazide diuretics were originally marketed and prescribed in starting doses much higher than the average starting and maximum doses that are currently used for the treatment of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Edwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwin 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-27 18:50:01 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Physiological studies in people show that the early effect of diuretic therapy is to decrease the extracellular volume, plasma volume and cardiac output with relatively unchanged peripheral resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Edwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwin 2006</LINK>). After several weeks of therapy cardiac output returns to normal and total peripheral resistance decreases. At the level of the kidney, thiazides inhibit reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions from the distal convoluted tubules by blocking the thiazide-sensitive Na<SUP>+</SUP>Cl<SUP>-</SUP> co-transporter (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2004</LINK>). Basic research studies demonstrate mechanisms whereby the different thiazide and thiazide-like drugs might differ in their actions and effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtz 2010</LINK>). However, none of these differential effects have been demonstrated in people (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The thiazide diuretics have a unique adverse effect profile.They potentially affect blood lipids, glucose, potassium, calcium, magnesium, uric acid and chloride concentrations. Thiazides potentially increase Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> concentrations by increasing calcium reabsorption at the distal tubule. This is thought to be due to lowering of the sodium concentration within the epithelial cells, and thus increase of the activity of the Na<SUP>+</SUP>/Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane to pump more Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> into the interstitium. Thiazides are also thought to increase the reabsorption of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> by a mechanism involving the reabsorption of sodium and calcium in the proximal tubule in response to sodium depletion. Some of this response is thought to be due to augmentation of the action of parathyroid hormone. Thiazides do not affect potassium transport directly; instead, they stimulate potassium urinary secretion indirectly. Hypokalemia results primarily from increased Na and fluid delivery to the distal tubule with an enhanced aldosterone effect. Thiazides also enhance potassium secretion by activating flow-sensitive maxi-K channels; these channels are molecularly distinct from the potassium secretory channels (<LINK REF="REF-Edwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwin 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:33:36 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>A previous review showed that treatment of primary hypertension with different antihypertensive drug classes, compared with placebo or no treatment, decreased stroke but had varied effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Wright--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>). Thiazide trials were classified as low-dose (hydrochlorothiazide equivalent of less than 50 mg/day) or high-dose (hydrochlorothiazide equivalent of <U>&gt;</U> 50 mg/day) based on the starting dose in each trial. All trials used stepped care therapy with drugs from other drug classes, aiming to achieve blood pressure targets of &lt; 140/90 mmHg. Interestingly enough, despite a similar magnitude of blood pressure reduction at one year (13/5 mmHg with first-line, low-dose thiazides versus 14/7 mmHg with first-line high-dose thiazides), there were dose-related differences in the impact on mortality and coronary heart disease. Surprisingly, high-dose thiazides (mean dose 90 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide equivalent) reduced stroke but not all-cause mortality or coronary heart disease significantly, whereas low-dose thiazides (mean dose of 24 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide equivalent) decreased all-cause mortality, stroke and coronary heart disease. Several different drugs from the thiazide or thiazide-like class were used in these trials, including bendrofluazide, chlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride, hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene, indapamide, methyclothiazide and trichlormethiazide.</P>
<P>Although it is now well established that first-line, low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides on systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure, when used as first-line single drugs, has not been established. Using excessive doses of thiazides may increase toxicity, by causing hypokalemia, hyponatraemia or other metabolic disturbances without additional blood pressure-lowering effect or commensurate clinical benefit. We also cannot assume that all diuretics will have the same efficacy in reducing blood pressure. The different classes of diuretics and individual drugs within each class might have differing efficacy and adverse effects. It is important to know whether the blood pressure-lowering effect of thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics as a class is different from other classes and to know the blood pressure-lowering dose-response relationship in relation to other effects of thiazides, such as their metabolic adverse effects.</P>
<P>The main aim of this systematic review is to quantify the dose-response relationship of thiazides in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The information derived from this review should facilitate future reviews of head-to-head comparisons with other drug classes and assist clinicians in choosing a specific thiazide drug at an appropriate dose.</P>

<P>We searched the electronic databases using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free-text terms relating to the individual thiazide drugs and hypertension.  We used no language restrictions. We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Hypertension Review Group with additional terms related to thiazide diuretics in the above listed databases to identify relevant articles. We translated the MEDLINE search strategy (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) into EMBASE (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and CENTRAL (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable.</P>

<P>We screened all potentially relevant articles and rejected articles on the initial screen if the title or abstract was not a report of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial or if it did not meet the minimum inclusion criteria. We retrieved the full texts of the remaining articles. Two independent review authors (VM and MN) assessed the eligibility of the trials using a trial selection form. The third review author (CJ) assessed the eligibility of non-English trials. JMW or KB resolved discrepancies. We counted trials with more than one publication only once.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:40:43 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Once it was determined that the trials met the inclusion criteria, two independent review authors (VM and MN) abstracted data for all primary and secondary outcomes using a standard form, and then cross-checked. If data were presented numerically (tables or text) or graphically (in figures), we preferred the numeric data because of possible measurement errors when estimating from the graphs. Both review authors (VM and MN) cross-checked all numeric calculations and graphic interpolations.</P>
<P>The position of the patient during blood pressure measurement may affect the blood pressure-lowering effect. However, in order not to lose valuable data, if only one position was reported, we collected data from that position. When blood pressure measurement data were available in more than one position, sitting blood pressure was the first preference, followed by standing and supine blood pressure measurements.</P>
<P>We extracted data for the following outcome measures:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The trough and/or peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline following the wash-out period.</LI>
<LI>The trough and/or peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurement taken between 3 and 12 weeks of the treatment period. If more than one blood pressure measurement was available then we used the weighted mean blood pressure levels.</LI>
<LI>The number of patient withdrawals due to adverse effects for each drug dose during the specified period of time the patient is taking the drug.</LI>
<LI>The blood concentrations of serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids with standard deviation (SD) at baseline as well as between 3 and 12 weeks during the treatment period.

<P>For continuous outcomes, we combined data for placebo-corrected systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction and for placebo-corrected serum concentrations of potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids using a mean difference (MD) method, presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Metabolic data are presented as mean difference with parentheses for 95% CI, with accuracy up to two decimal points.</P>
<P>For the dichotomous outcome withdrawals due to adverse effects, data are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We have not provided absolute risk difference and number needed to treat to benefit or harm due to very low-quality evidence for the outcome 'withdrawal due to adverse effects' due to high risk of selective reporting bias.</P>

In case missing information was not available, we included the best estimate based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same dose.</P>
<P>In case of missing SD for the change in blood pressure, we imputed the SD based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same dose. We used the following hierarchy (listed from high to low preference) to impute SD values:</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:45:00 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We calculated the heterogeneity of treatment effects between the trials using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test in RevMan 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We applied the fixed-effect model to obtain summary statistics of pooled trials, unless significant between-study heterogeneity was present, in which case we used the random-effects model. If a statistically significant difference compared to placebo control was still present using the random-effects model, then we reported the fixed pooled estimate and CI because of the tendency for smaller trials, which are susceptible to publication bias, to be over-weighted with a random-effects analysis. We compared overall effect size using both a fixed-effect and random-effects model and determined that they were not significantly different from each other.</P>
<P>If the calculated I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic value was greater than 50%, we explored the reasons for heterogeneity and the trials contributing to the heterogeneity (differences in baseline characteristics between trials and their possible impact on the magnitude of systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction).</P>

We directly compared the effect size between doses for each thiazide diuretic drug only using data from trials that randomized participants to different doses of the drug within the same trial. In case direct comparison was not possible, we did an 'adjusted indirect comparison' using the computer software developed by <LINK REF="REF-Wells-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2009</LINK>.

<P>The search strategy identified 18,293 citations; after de-duplicating we screened 11,824 citations. Of these, 75 (0.7% of screened articles) were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria. Fifty-nine RCTs were of a parallel-group design yielding data that could be used in the evaluation of dose-related blood pressure and metabolic effects of six thiazide diuretics (bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide and metolazone). See the PRISMA diagram (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sixteen of the 75 RCTs were cross-over trials, of which we excluded 15 because data were not reported for the initial parallel period. The single cross-over trial which provided separate data for periods one and two compared indapamide 2.5 mg/day with placebo in 24 patients for a duration of eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Soltero-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Soltero 1989</LINK>).

For details, please see the 'Risk of bias' tables in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Of all 60 included studies, we only judged six (10%) as at low risk of bias in at least three of the six items evaluated using the 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="STD-Chrysant-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chrysant 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jounela-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jounela 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McVeigh-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McVeigh 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papademetriou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Papademetriou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmieder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schmieder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vardan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vardan 1987</LINK>). We judged the other 54 included trials (90%) as at unclear or high risk of bias. Thus, the overall evidence in this review is subject to a high risk of bias. This has to be taken into consideration in interpreting the findings. It is unclear what effects residual bias may have on our estimate of the efficacy of systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction with thiazides, but it is likely that their harms are underestimated, including withdrawal due to adverse effects and adverse or potentially adverse metabolic changes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Funding bias</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-eight (47%) of the 60 included studies were industry-sponsored but in 26 of the 28 the bias would have been in favor of the other drug being tested and not in favor of the thiazide. Only five trials (8%) were sponsored by national agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Aging, National Heart and Lung Institute etc. and all of these were older trials and studied high doses of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide. For the remaining 26 trials (42.4%), the source of funding was not reported. See the 'Risk of bias' tables in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias is defined in this review as selective publication of studies with positive results and is another source of bias that may have skewed the results of this review. Examining the funnel plots for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in this review suggested asymmetry, indicating that there was a high risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses based on risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>In view of the fact that it was not possible to predict the direction of the bias in the industry-funded trials and the trials where the source of funding was not reported, plus the higher doses used in the trials sponsored by national agencies, we did not attempt any subgroup comparisons.</P>

Chlorthalidone 25 mg/day did not lower systolic blood pressure more than 12.5 mg/day. Chlorthalidone 75 mg/day did not lower systolic blood pressure more than 50 mg/day, and 50 mg/day did not lower systolic blood pressure more than 25 mg/day or 12.5 to 15 mg/day. Therefore the maximum systolic blood pressure-lowering dose of chlorthalidone is likely to be 12.5 mg/day, which lowered systolic blood pressure by -10.1 (95% CI<B> </B>-13.9 to -6.3) mmHg.

Both chlorthalidone 75 mg and the 50 mg/day dose did not significantly lower diastolic blood pressure compared to 12.5 mg/day. However, 25 mg/day significantly lowered diastolic blood pressure more than 12.5 mg/day by -2.2 (95% CI -4.3 to -0.2) mmHg. Chlorthalidone 75 mg/day dose was not significantly different from 50 mg/day dose nor was 50 mg dose significantly different from 25 mg/day. Therefore chlorthalidone 25 mg/day is likely to result in maximum diastolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy.

</P>
<P>There is selective outcome reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects. This outcome was reported only in 31 of the 60 trials (52%) meeting the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Bendrofluazide resulted in significantly lower withdrawals due to adverse effects compared with placebo based on one trial in 257 patients (risk ratio (RR) 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57) (<LINK REF="STD-Carlsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carlsen 1990</LINK>). Chlorthalidone resulted in significantly lower withdrawals due to adverse effects compared with placebo based on five out of eight trials in 1058 patients (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.87) (<LINK REF="STD-Bradley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hulley-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hulley 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Materson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Materson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morledge-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Morledge 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vardan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vardan 1987</LINK>). Hydrochlorothiazide resulted in significantly lower withdrawals due to adverse effects compared with placebo based on 20 out of 40 trials in 3698 patients (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.93). Indapamide did not significantly change withdrawals due to adverse effects compared with placebo based on six out of nine trials in 1874 patients (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.46)) (<LINK REF="STD-Ambrosioni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrosioni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capone-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Capone 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiddes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fiddes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-2006" TYPE="STUDY">London 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weidler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weidler 1995</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 20:03:15 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>This review provides the best available evidence of the blood pressure-lowering effect of thiazide monotherapy for the treatment of elevated blood pressure. The drug for which we have the most data is hydrochlorothiazide: 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 6725 patients. It is the only drug for which we have sufficient RCTs over the commonly prescribed dose range to demonstrate a clear dose-response effect. There is a very clear dose response for systolic blood pressure over the range 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/day (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). The test for subgroup differences for systolic blood pressure was significant(Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 22.16, df = 5 (P value = 0.0005), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77.4%), but not for diastolic blood pressure (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 6.22, df = 5 (P value = 0.29), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 19.6%). This means that systolic blood pressure-lowering at higher doses of hydrochlorothiazide was significantly greater than at lower doses, but diastolic blood pressure-lowering was not significantly different between the higher or lower dose.</P>
<P>See also <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>. We plotted the log dose-response curve using individual data points from each study and the resulting curve showed a significant dose response for systolic blood pressure (slope -6.16 (-8.75 to -3.56) and r = - 0.58) but not for diastolic blood pressure (slope -0.82 (-3.44 to 1.79) and r = -0.43). The significant dose response for hydrochlorothiazide over the dose range 6.25 to 50 mg demonstrates that for each doubling of the dose there is a 2 mmHg greater reduction in systolic blood pressure. There are not enough data at 50 and 100 mg/day but the data that are available suggest that the maximal effect is achieved with a dose of 50 mg/day and that at least 80% of the blood pressure-lowering effect occurs with 25 mg/day. The confidence intervals for the estimates for 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day are narrow, demonstrating that the findings are robust and unlikely to be changed by further RCTs. Further RCTs studying the blood pressure-lowering effect of 50 mg/day are necessary to have a better estimate of the effect for that dose.</P>
<P>We compared the results obtained in this review with the published review of hydrochlorothiazide given as a second-line drug (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK>) (see Table 18). The <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK> review has more data on hydrochlorothiazide, from 53 RCTs in 15,129 hypertensive patients with baseline blood pressure of 156/101 mmHg, compared to the 40 RCTs in 7284 patients with baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg included in this review. Results based on both of these reviews show that the magnitude of the systolic blood pressure-lowering effect is the same whether the drug is given alone or added as a second-line drug to another antihypertensive drug. This provides strong evidence for the dose-response relationship and the average magnitude of effect for each dose. Since 6.25 to 50 mg/day is also the common dose range prescribed, the review provides valuable support for dose titration over this range of doses for physicians treating hypertension.</P>

<P>Reduction in diastolic blood pressure does not show a significant dose-response relationship based on 40 RCTs in 7284 patients (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Based on the results of both of these reviews, there is a trend toward a dose-response relationship, and a similar magnitude of effect whether the drug is given as monotherapy or as a second-line drug.</P>
<P>The greater reduction and dose-related reduction in systolic compared to diastolic blood pressure means that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related reduction of pulse pressure by 2 to 6 mmHg over the dose range of 6.25 to 50 mg/day. At maximal doses the average reduction in pulse pressure is 5.5 mmHg. This magnitude and pattern is different from other drug classes. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and renin inhibitors lower pulse pressure by 3 mmHg on average and there is no dose-response relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2008</LINK>). Non-selective beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure: at most 2 mmHg and no dose-response effect (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The thiazide with the second most data is indapamide, which lowered blood pressure by 7.4/3.6 mmHg at the lowest dose studied (1.25 mg/day) and 9/4 mmHg for all doses combined. The lowest dose result is very similar to the results with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. There was no dose-response relationship for doses of indapamide higher than 1.25 mg/day and unfortunately there were no RCTs for doses of one-half or one-quarter of 1.25 mg/day. These data for indapamide show that the maximal blood pressure lowering effect is achieved with the lowest doses of 1 to 2 mg/day and there is no rationale for using higher doses.</P>
<P>The thiazide with the third most data is chlorthalidone. Like indapamide, chlorthalidone showed no dose response over the doses studied. It appeared that the lowest dose studied(12.5 mg/day) had the maximum blood pressure-lowering effect. On first look it appears that chlorthalidone lowers blood pressure more than hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide. However, the baseline systolic blood pressure was significantly higher and the baseline diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the chlorthalidone trials. When the isolated systolic blood pressure trials were deselected, the blood pressure-lowering effect of chlorthalidone was not significantly different from the other thiazides and, furthermore, the overall blood pressure-lowering effect of chlorthalidone was not different from hydrochlorothiazide at the maximally effective doses of 50 mg and above.</P>
<P>The fact that chlorthalidone is more potent than hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg of chlorthalidone being equivalent to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide) is likely due to pharmacokinetic differences between it and hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide has a half-life of 8 to 15 hours with long-term dosing. However, several studies show that the pharmacodynamic response is much longer than predicted by the half-life (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1982</LINK>; Lutterodt 1980). Chlorthalidone in comparison has a half-life ranging from 45 to 60 hours with long-term dosing. Interindividual variability in half-life is large. Chlorthalidone serum concentrations after 100 mg are only twice those of a 25 mg dose, indicating a flat dose-serum concentration curve (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riess-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riess 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1981</LINK>). However, the longer half-life does not mean that chlorthalidone is a superior antihypertensive compound. The data in this review suggest that doses of chlorthalidone that should be prescribed are 12.5 mg/day and lower. RCTs of the blood pressure-lowering effect of chlorthalidone at doses lower than 12.5 mg/day would be useful.</P>
<P>The other three thiazides had only one RCT each so no conclusions can be made about dose-response effects or relative blood pressure-lowering potency. From the data available there is no reason to suggest that they are any different from hydrochlorothiazide in their blood pressure-lowering effect. Any subgroup differences between the different thiazides in blood pressure-lowering effect are more likely due to differences in patient population (baseline blood pressure, etc.) or biases in trial conduct than to any pharmacological differences in the magnitude or pattern of the blood pressure-lowering effect.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Harms of thiazides</HEADING>
<P>The limited data on withdrawal due to adverse effects suggested a decrease in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. This does not mean that placebo is more harmful than a thiazide. The likely reason for this is that withdrawal due to an increase in blood pressure was inappropriately counted as an adverse effect. As can be seen in the table below, the proportion of RCTs reporting withdrawals due to adverse effects (32/60 (53%)) is much less than the total number reporting blood pressure data (48/60 (80%)). This suggests that the trials in which withdrawals due to adverse effects were higher for the drug than for placebo were selectively under reported and this represents a high risk of selective reporting bias. In this review, therefore, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether thiazides increase withdrawals due to adverse effects with short-term use.</P>

<P>Metabolic data were also only reported in a minority of trials (see Table 21 below).</P>
<P>The available data show a clear reduction in serum potassium, an increase in serum uric acid and an increase in serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. All of these effects are well known to occur with thiazides. New findings from this review are that the metabolic effects were greater with higher doses and were less, in general, with hydrochlorothiazides than the other thiazides. In addition, serum glucose was not increased by thiazides overall. In fact the only thiazide associated with an increase in glucose in this review was chlorthalidone. However, in this review, the high risk of selective reporting bias for the metabolic data and indirect comparison between different thiazide drugs makes drawing strong conclusions impossible.</P>

<P>The magnitude of the dose-related systolic and diastolic blood pressure-lowering is from a low to high quality of evidence for hydrochlorothiazide. We determined the evidence for the overall blood pressure-lowering effect of maximal doses of thiazides to be of high quality. We judged the data on withdrawals due to adverse effects to be of very low quality since there is selective reporting bias for this outcome and because withdrawal due to an increase in blood pressure was inappropriately included as an adverse event in the placebo group.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 17:41:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>In this review we systematically searched various databases from 1946 until February 2014 and it is unlikely that any RCTs have been missed. The robustness of the blood pressure-lowering efficacy data is validated by comparing and demonstrating the similar magnitude of blood pressure reduction in this systematic review to that by <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK> on the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide as second-line therapy for primary hypertension. The <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK> review has more data on hydrochlorothiazide (from 53 RCTs in 15,129 hypertensive patients with baseline blood pressure of 156/101 mmHg) compared to the 40 RCTs in 7284 patients with baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg included in this review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-27 17:41:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias for each of the RCTs included in this review (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The majority of RCTs (82% of included studies) were published before the year 2000, prior to standardization of reporting of RCTs. However, it is clear that thiazides lower blood pressure, that this is dose-related and that the magnitude is probably approximately what is reported here. Although the magnitude of systolic and diastolic blood pressure-lowering is similar to the effect when using thiazide as a second-line drug (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK>), we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to moderate for some doses as it is an indirect comparison of the effect size with wider confidence intervals compared to the Chen review, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>There is a high risk of bias in the adverse effect data (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), therefore the available evidence for adverse events is likely not an accurate reflection of reality.</P>
<P>The evidence is very low quality for the metabolic data due to the high risk of selective outcome reporting bias and a weak interpretation due to multiple indirect comparisons between different thiazide drugs.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-05-27 17:41:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>One limitation of this review is that it is restricted to published trials and it is possible that smaller trials are missing (publication bias). See funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Our judgement of an unclear to high risk of bias in most of the included trials could also have led to an overestimation of blood pressure-lowering effect and underestimation of adverse metabolic effects. The finding in this review that withdrawals due to adverse effects are lower with a thiazide compared to placebo is unlikely to be true. The short duration of trials in this review make it good for estimating the blood pressure-lowering effect, but not accurate for estimating long-term benefits or harms of thiazides.</P>
<P>Although we have followed the method of analysis for multiple armed studies described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (section 16.5.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>), since many of the included studies had multiple dose-ranging treatment arms being compared to the same placebo group, the resulting comparisons remain co-related and this method only partially overcomes unit of analysis error. The approach we used to overcome this unit of analysis error was to split the shared placebo group in to two or more groups with smaller sample sizes, to include two or more reasonably independent comparisons in the meta-analysis as if they were from different studies.</P>
<P>We have followed the usual convention to round up numbers if <U>&gt;</U> 0.5 and round down if &lt; 0.5, therefore the magnitude of the blood pressure-lowering effect is reported up to one decimal point and for metabolic data it is reported up to two decimal points in the Results section of this review. However, in the Abstract, for the sake of simplicity, using the usual convention the overall systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect in mmHg is rounded to the nearest number (mmHg) without decimal points.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Messerli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messerli 2011</LINK> conducted a systematic review of the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide for a minimum treatment period of four weeks in randomized trials comparing hydrochlorothiazide to other antihypertensive drug classes. Both office and ambulatory blood pressure measurements were available in eight studies (488 patients in total) using hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/day for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean baseline office systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 163/98 mmHg. The reduction in office systolic blood pressure from baseline was 12/7 mmHg, whereas the reduction in ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure was 8/4 mmHg. The Messerli review is misleading and has been used to suggest that hydrochlorothiazide lowers office blood pressure more than ambulatory blood pressure. The ambulatory blood pressure reduction observed in the Messerli review is very similar to the reduction in placebo-corrected office systolic/diastolic blood pressure in our review(6 to 8/3 to 4 mmHg). Our review is a more robust treatment effect estimate based on a greater number of RCTs and patients compared to the <LINK REF="REF-Messerli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messerli 2011</LINK> review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Law-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2009</LINK> included 354 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of thiazides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs and calcium channel-blockers administered either singly or in combination. They included both parallel and cross-over trials together in their analysis. However, they presented placebo-adjusted reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure according to dose expressed as a multiple of standard (recommended) doses of the drugs. What were considered as the standard doses for thiazide drugs were not described in the review. They combined trial data for specified equivalent daily doses of different drugs as the "usual maintenance dose" in reference pharmacopoeias. When a range was given they considered the lower dose as standard dose. The Law review did not present the magnitude of blood pressure-lowering efficacy of each of the drugs within the thiazide diuretic class at all available doses from the included trials but presented data from all thiazide drugs together as a multiple of standard doses. Therefore, unlike the Law review, our review provides evidence that there is a dose-related effect for hydrochlorothiazide and thus combining all doses is not rational.</P>
<P>The overall estimated reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with thiazide diuretics in this review (-9/-4 mmHg) is similar to the treatment effect estimate in a systematic review of loop diuretics (-8/-4 mmHg) (<LINK REF="REF-Musini-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2009c</LINK>). This estimate was based on nine trials in 460 patients with a baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of nine weeks and was likely an overestimate due to the high risk of bias in the included studies. The loop diuretics review also did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of associated harms because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the them. This review shows that thiazides lower systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure more and diastolic blood pressure less than shown in other Cochrane reviews on ARBs (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2009b</LINK>), ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2009a</LINK>), renin inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Musini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2008</LINK>) and non-selective beta-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2014</LINK>). This observation is based on an indirect comparison between different antihypertensive drug class reviews compared to placebo control using similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. Therefore the common belief that different classes of antihypertensive drugs have the same blood pressure-lowering effect is likely to be wrong.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-27 18:55:08 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>This systematic review demonstrates a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/day is 4/2, 6/3, 8/3 and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. The data for the other thiazide drugs did not show evidence of a dose response, but showed that lower doses (indapamide 1.25 to 1.5 mg/day and chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day) achieved a probable maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of 8 to 10/4 mmHg. As there is a greater effect on systolic blood pressure than diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials, but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the other thiazides did not. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-27 17:41:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>For hydrochlorothiazide, more trials are needed for doses of 50 to 100 mg/day. For thiazides other than hydrochlorothiazide, more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed at lower doses to define the dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. Many thiazides have no RCT data on the blood pressure-lowering effect.</P>
<P>All RCTs should report withdrawals due to adverse effects and all laboratory data that are measured in the trial.</P>
<P>Blood pressure-lowering effect should be reported separately by sex and race, as at the present time it is not known whether there are differences in these subgroups.</P>

<P>The inclusion criteria for patients with hypertension in the protocol was defined as those with systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg or more, which was corrected to include the generally accepted standard definition of hypertension as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or more.</P>
<P>The search methods section in the protocol was limited to searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL until June 2008, using the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Hypertension Group, with additional terms used to identify the relevant articles. In this completed review, the search of electronic databases also included ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and bibliographic citations. In case of incomplete reports, we used MEDLINE to search for related papers. We searched bibliographies of pertinent articles, reviews and texts for additional citations. We used previously published meta-analyses on the dose response of thiazide diuretics, as well as narrative reviews, to help identify references to trials. We searched electronic databases using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free-text terms relating to the individual thiazide drugs and hypertension. We used no language restrictions. We updated the search from June 2008 until February 2014.</P>
<P>In order to address missing data we attempted to contact the study's authors using the first author firstly then any of the co-authors. Since using the address and telephone contact details of authors of trials before 1990 was proving to be very difficult, we decided to use the publication year 1990 as a cut-off for verifying the authors' contact information.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The hierarchy of imputing standard deviation data in this review has minor differences from that stated in the protocol and was standardized to match other Cochrane reviews measuring the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of other antihypertensive drug classes (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) using similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>To reflect the content of the review better the title was changed from 'Blood pressure lowering efficacy of thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension' to 'Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension'.</P>

Anomalously high DBP response (-31 mmHg) from 1 patient in the placebo group increased the mean and variability in that group substantially enough to lessen the magnitude of statistical difference compared to active treatment (analysis was done including this outlier patient).

Detailed reporting of biochemical data restricted to potassium levels only. Mortalities, SAEs and total AEs were not reported.

<P>A sample size calculation was not provided. The study included elderly (60 years or older) patients with isolated systolic hypertension only (i.e. SBP 160 to 219 mmHg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg). A step-up protocol was used wherein poor response (i.e. BP goal not reached) after 4 weeks led to a doubling of drug dosage from 1 to 2 capsules of chlorthalidone per day; poor response in patients receiving placebo led to a simulated randomization with a doubling of placebo capsules. Therefore with increasing and/or changing medication, BP results were taken from the first 4 weeks of the study only. The study authors stated that there were no statistically significant differences (P value = NS) across treatment groups in baseline SBP and DBP. Gender and race were available for all patients combined into one group therefore P values could not be calculated. We determined that baseline biochemical levels were not statistically significant between treatment groups. Mean ± SEM for BP data at 4, 8 and 12 weeks useful. Not all patients received potassium supplementation. Mortalities and SAEs were not reported</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Variability was not given for heart rate, biochemical data or body weight. BP, biochemical data and vital signs were presented separately (not combined) for each group of patients (group A and group B) as well as for the indapamide and placebo treatment phase. Therefore, both indapamide and placebo represent 2 data sets. Mortalities and SAEs were not reported. Total AEs were presented for group A and B separately, however there is no information indicating which treatment (IND or PLB) the patient was receiving at the time the adverse event was reported</P>
