<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Molindone is an older antipsychotic drug with a receptor binding profile similar to that of quetiapine, a novel atypical antipsychotic. We sought to determine the effects of molindone compared with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia and related psychoses. We included fourteen randomised controlled trials. When compared to other typical antipsychotics molindone shows no difference in effectiveness and is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, it does however cause significantly more weight loss. At present there is no evidence to suggest that it may have an atypical profile.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for people with schizophrenia. In recent years new or atypical antipsychotics have been introduced. These are less likely to produce movement disorders and raise serum prolactin.</P>
<P>Researchers have suggested that molindone should be classified as an atypical antipsychotic.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of molindone compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>For the original search we searched the following databases: Biological Abstracts (1980-1999), The Cochrane Library CENTRAL (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 1999), CINAHL (1982-1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), LILACS (1982-1999), PSYNDEX (1977-1999), and PsycLIT (1974-1999). We also searched pharmaceutical databases on the Dialog Corporation Datastar and Dialog and the references of all identified studies for further trials. Finally, we contacted the manufacturer of molindone and the authors of any relevant trials.</P>
<P>For the update of this review, we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (August 2005).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials that compared molindone to other treatments for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We extracted data independently and analysed on an intention to treat basis calculating, for binary data, the fixed effect relative risk (RR), their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and the number needed to treat or harm (NNT or NNH). We excluded data if loss to follow up was greater than 50%.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included fourteen studies. Duration ranged from very short (10 days) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over three months. For measures of global assessment, available data do not justify any conclusions on the comparative efficacy of molindone and placebo. When compared to other typical antipsychotics we found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness (doctors' 4 RCTs n=150, RR 1.13, CI 0.69 to 1.86; nurses 4RCTs n=146, RR 1.23, CI 0.82 to 1.86). Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The strength of the evidence relating to this compound is limited, owing to small sample size, poor study design, limited outcomes and incomplete reporting. Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss). Data from this review suggest, at present, there is no evidence to suggest that it may have an atypical profile.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>In treating people with schizophrenia, choosing the most appropriate, effective and tolerable antipsychotic drug is a key to maximising the usefulness of medication. According to recent treatment guidelines, both conventional/typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs may be reasonable choices in the treatment of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-RCP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2000</LINK>). Some atypical drugs are available for intramuscular administration as well as oral administration.</P>
<P>Typical antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine, are widely used as the first line treatment for people with schizophrenia, in the acute as well as chronic forms of the illness (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1995</LINK>). However, the atypical class of antipsychotic drugs, most of which have been formulated relatively recently, are making important inroads into this traditional approach (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-MacKenzie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood MacKenzie 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>'Atypical' is a term widely used to describe antipsychotics which have a low propensity to produce movement disorders, sedation and raise serum prolactin (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwin 1994</LINK>). There is some suggestion that the different adverse effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics make them more acceptable to people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1997</LINK>). Certainly, the adverse effects of the typical drugs, such as movement disorders and sedation, are problematic and can result in poor compliance with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-CWG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CWG 1998</LINK>). More recently the metabolic adverse effects of the atypicals have caused concern (<LINK REF="REF-Melkersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melkersson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking) of schizophrenia seem more responsive to the typical antipsychotic drugs than the negative symptoms. This latter cluster of symptoms (poverty of speech, lack of motivation, apathy and inability to express emotions - <LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>), is very disabling and may respond better to the atypical antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1995</LINK>), although this too has not yet been adequately established (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Atypical antipsychotics are more expensive than conventional drugs, as reported in the latest NICE guidance (<LINK REF="REF-Bagnall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagnall 2003</LINK>), but it has been suggested that if they do indeed reduce a person's need for inpatient services their use would result in a net reduction of costs (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Molindone is an indole derivative (3-ethyl-6,7-dihydro-2-methyl-5- (morpholinomethyl) indol-4(5H)-one) and is sold by Abbott in the USA as Lidone (capsules of 5mg, 10mg, and 25mg) and as Moban by Endo, also in the USA (tablets of 5mg, 10mg and 25mg, and a concentrate for oral use of 20mg/ml). In Finland Orion sells it as Moban (tablets of 25mg and 50mg, and a mixture for oral use of 20mg/ml). It is an antipsychotic agent with atypical neuropharmacological profile in doses from 40mg up to 225mg/day. It may be administered once daily and has a terminal plasma half-life after oral administration of about 6½ hours (<LINK REF="REF-Prosser-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prosser 1989</LINK>). Reduction of body weight has been reported. It has a similar profile to quetiapine, with very low binding to all receptors. It has been suggested that molindone should be classed as an atypical antipsychotic due to its low incidence of extrapyramidal adverse effects when taken at a clinically effective dose (<LINK REF="REF-Pickar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickar 1995</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical effects and safety of molindone compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotics, for treating schizophrenia and related psychoses. </P>
<P>As secondary objectives, we proposed to investigate:<BR/>1. Whether people with schizophrenia described as 'treatment resistant' differed in their response from those whose illness was not designated as such;<BR/>2. Whether people having predominantly positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia were more responsive to molindone than those without this designation; and <BR/>3. Whether people experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia differed in their response from those at a later stage of their illness.</P>

<P>3. Authors of studies<BR/>We contacted authors of studies when necessary to clarify data, and asked for additional studies. </P>
<P>4. Pharmaceutical company<BR/>We contacted Endo Pharmaceuticals to obtain data on unpublished trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>We independently selected study citations identified from the trial search in order to assess their relevance for inclusion according to the selection criteria. Each study citation was inspected by AMB and/or MF and/or RL. If we identified studies as relevant or if there was any disagreement about inclusion, we obtained the full article. In cases of dispute we inspected the full article and attempted to reach an agreement through discussion. If this failed, we were assisted by the third reviewer to try to resolve any doubts. If agreement could still not be reached, we contacted the authors for more information and allocated the article to the list of 'those awaiting assessment' until additional information could be acquired to resolve the situation.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B. </P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials. </P>
<P>3. Data collection <BR/>AMB and MF independently extracted data from selected trials, while a third reviewer separately re-extracted information from two different samples (10%). When disputes arose we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data but added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis <BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>We assessed outcomes using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so we were unable to analysis this.</P>
<P>4.2 Incomplete data <BR/>We did not include trial outcomes if more than 40% of people were not reported in the final analysis. </P>
<P>4.3 Dichotomous - yes/no - data <BR/>We carried out an intention to treat analysis. On the condition that more than 60% of people completed the study, everyone allocated to the intervention were counted, whether they completed the follow up or not. It was assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a predefined cut off point for determining clinical effectiveness we used this where appropriate. Otherwise it was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score, this could be considered as a clinically significant response. Similarly, we considered a rating of 'at least much improved' according to the Clinical Global Impression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) as a clinically significant response.</P>
<P>The relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios which tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We inspected data to see if an analysis using a fixed effects model made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) as the inverse of the risk difference. </P>
<P>4.4 Continuous data <BR/>4.4.1 Normally distributed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we only presented endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data were excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We contacted authors of studies reporting only change data for endpoint figures. We reported on-normally distributed data in the 'other data types' tables. </P>
<P>4.4.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. It has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) are associated with bias, therefore we excluded the results of such scales. Furthermore, we stipulated that the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, we included such data but commented on the data as 'prone to bias'. </P>
<P>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, we presented both sets of data and inspected the general direction of effect.</P>
<P>4.4.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups, again based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. </P>
<P>4.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-19999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 19999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then visual inspection of graphs was used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data, but presented the data separately and investigated the reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>We compared results for high doses (however 'high' was defined in the study or, if such a definition was not presented, greater than 15 mg aripiprazole per day) to those for lower doses with regard to the primary outcome of relapse. </P>
<P>8. General <BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for molindone</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of studies please see 'Included and Excluded studies' tables. </P>
<P>1. The search<BR/>The original search found 61 citations, of which 31 looked like possible randomised controlled trials. We found 17 of the 31 not to be randomised when we obtained the full citations. The majority of the studies were carried out in North America, with two of the included studies having been carried out in Europe. The 31 citations we ordered were published between 1966 and 1993. </P>
<P>For the update we found 17 new citations of which six looked like possible randomised controlled trials. Three of these were found not to be randomised when we obtained the full publications, and two had no usable data on outcomes. We could include only one new study in the 2006 update.</P>
<P>2. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded twenty two studies. Four were review articles, three were in vitro or animal studies, one studied the effects of molindone on healthy volunteers, three were clinical trials of molindone that did not use a control group, two were retrospective studies of hospital records and one was a short report of two trials already included. We excluded one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Claghorn-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Claghorn 1970</LINK>) because it was unclear whether it was randomised, and no usable data on outcomes was given. We excluded three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Claghorn-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Claghorn 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sikich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sikich 2001</LINK>) because it was unclear whether they were randomised, and we excluded a further three because no usable data on outcomes was given (<LINK REF="STD-Clardy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Clardy 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. Awaiting assessment<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fuentenebro-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fuentenebro 1989</LINK>) is awaiting translation .</P>
<P>4. Ongoing studies<BR/>We found no reports of ongoing studies in the retrieved literature. </P>
<P>5. Included studies<BR/>We included fourteen trials, ten of these were randomised and the remaining four were reported to be double blind but it was unclear if they were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smythies-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Smythies 1982</LINK>). All included trials were reported to be double blind and all were full journal articles. All of the studies, except two (<LINK REF="STD-Itil-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Itil 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1993</LINK>) took place in North America and six studies received some sponsorship from Endo Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturers of molindone, one from E.I Dupont Pharmaceuticals (<LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1990</LINK>) while one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dufresne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dufresne 1993</LINK>) received sponsorship from the manufacturers of thioridizine, the comparator drug. We have written to the authors of all included studies and Endo Pharmaceuticals for further information and for clarification of some issues.</P>
<P>5.1 Length of trials<BR/>Two studies which used intramuscular preparations of molindone were of very short duration, lasting ten days or less, and four of the studies were of 'short duration', as defined by our protocol for this review, lasting between four and six weeks. The remaining seven were medium-term, lasting for between two and three months. One study of masking effects of molindone for tardive dyskinesia had a treatment period of only 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>5.2 Participants<BR/>Six of the studies met operationalised diagnoses of schizophrenia or other severe mental illness by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria. Diagnosis in one other study was confirmed by the research unit psychiatrist; in the remaining seven studies it was unclear how diagnosis was reached. Three studies included those with non-schizophrenia psychoses. In seven studies the participants had chronic or sub chronic schizophrenia and in one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Dufresne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dufresne 1993</LINK>) participants were also depressed at the start of the study (mean Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) rating above 18 for all groups). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1990</LINK>) of masking effects of molindone, participants were also diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia. In five studies participants were suffering an acute exacerbation of their illness, and in two studies the condition of participants on entry was unclear. </P>
<P>5.3 Setting<BR/>Participants in all but two of the included studies were in hospital at the beginning of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Brauzer-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Brauzer 1971</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1990</LINK> randomised outpatients with chronic schizophrenia. </P>
<P>5.4 Study size<BR/>Sample size was small for all studies. <LINK REF="STD-Itil-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Itil 1972</LINK> was the largest study, with 60 participants, while the smallest, with 16 participants, was <LINK REF="STD-Smythies-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Smythies 1982</LINK>. No trial reports included a power/sample size calculation.</P>
<P>5.5 Interventions<BR/>Various comparators were used, the most popular being trifluoperazine (seven studies). Molindone was also compared to haloperidol (five studies), chlorpromazine (two studies), thioridizine (one study) and placebo (one study). Doses of molindone ranged from 10-500mg/day.</P>
<P>5.6 Outcomes<BR/>5.6.1 Definition of improvement<BR/>Definition of improvement consisted of a score of one or two on the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale assessed separately by doctors and by nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1971</LINK>), or by the Nurses' Observational Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE) (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1969</LINK>), or in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dufresne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dufresne 1993</LINK>) by a 20% decrease in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score, plus CGI rating of 'mildly ill' or end BPRS score &lt;35.</P>
<P>5.6.2 Outcome scales<BR/>Details of the scales that supplied usable data for this review are shown below. We gave reasons for exclusion of data from other instruments in the 'Outcomes' of the 'Included studies' section. </P>
<P>5.6.2.1 Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>).<BR/>A rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify<BR/>severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven-point scoring system is<BR/>usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery.</P>
<P>5.6.2.2 Nurses' Observational Scale for Inpatient Evaluation - NOSIE (<LINK REF="REF-Honigfeld-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honigfeld 1965</LINK>)<BR/>An 80-item scale with items rated on a five-point scale from zero (not present) to four (always present). Ratings are taken from behaviour over the previous three days. The seven headings are social competence, social interest, personal neatness, co-operation, irritability, manifest psychosis and psychotic depression. Scoring ranges from 0-320.</P>
<P>5.6.2.3 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>).<BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>5.6.2.4 The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) <BR/>The HAM-D is a well-established 17-item scale for the measurement of depression and is sensitive to change. </P>
<P>5.6.2.5 Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale - TESS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>). <BR/>This checklist assesses a variety of characteristics for each adverse event, including severity, relationship to the drug, temporal characteristics (timing after a dose, duration and pattern during the day), contributing factors, course and action taken to counteract the effect. Symptoms can be listed a priori or can be recorded as observed by the investigator. </P>
<P>5.6.2.6 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This has been used to assess tardive dyskinesia, a long-term, drug-induced movement disorder and short-term movement disorders such as tremor.</P>
<P>5.6.3 Missing outcomes<BR/>We found no data relating to outcomes such as costs, or clinically relevant outcomes such as quality of daily functioning, 'employed', 'trouble with the police', satisfaction with care. No study reassured the reader as regards mortality.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>Only one study fell into quality category A (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>) as, with additional information from the trial author, randomisation was adequately described. The other thirteen studies of molindone fell into category B as it was not clear exactly how randomisation had been conducted (in four studies it was not stated that randomisation had been performed, however the studies were reported as 'double blind' so we assumed that random allocation was at least attempted in these studies). The reader, therefore, was not assured that the introduction of biases was minimised at this crucial stage. It has been shown that poor reporting of randomisation increases the odds of introducing bias in reporting outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>Five studies clearly described adequate precautions for blinding of treatment. No included trial tested the adequacy of the blindness of those rating outcomes. </P>
<P>3. Loss to follow-up<BR/>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1968</LINK>), more than one-quarter of participants left the study before it ended. Exactly why people decided to leave, or were excluded was not, however, explicit. In most of the studies, attrition was either not reported or was impossible to calculate, due to numbers at the end of the study being given, but numbers randomised at the beginning of the study not being given. Once participants leave a study, unless the trialists continue to follow and collect data, assumptions have to be made about outcome. Whatever the management of lost data, interpretation of results with large degrees of attrition must be undertaken with caution.</P>
<P>4. Data reporting<BR/>The barely adequate reporting of randomisation within published papers, possible lack of double blindness for these outcomes and unclear reasons for loss to follow up would suggest that all estimates of effect of the experimental intervention are prone to exaggeration (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. General<BR/>Although we included fourteen studies, the number of studies reporting each individual outcome was never more than six and, for many outcomes, only one or two studies were pooled. Sample sizes were small in all included studies (n in each group &lt;31).</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1. MOLINDONE versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>2.1. Global assessment<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>) defined lack of response as CGI-I scores &gt;3. Response was assessed separately by doctors and by nurses. There was no significant difference between molindone and placebo in the doctors' evaluations (1RCT n=29, RR 0.73 95% CI 0.4 to 1.4) and in nurses' evaluations (1RCT n=29, RR 0.80 95% CI 0.6 to 1.03). The sample sizes were small (no more than 15 people in each group) therefore we cannot conclude whether the effect of molindone would be better, worse or equal to that of placebo, but the trend in the nurses' evaluations suggests that molindone may be more effective than placebo in improving global state.</P>
<P>2.2. Mental state<BR/>No studies comparing molindone to placebo reported on any mental state outcomes.</P>
<P>2.3. Leaving the study early<BR/>No studies comparing molindone to placebo reported on the outcome 'leaving the study early'.</P>
<P>2.4. Side effects (N=1, n=29)<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>) failed to show that molindone would cause more rigidity (1RCT n=29, RR 8.44 CI 0.5 to 144), tremor (1RCT n=29, RR 8.44 CI 0.5 to 144) or akathisia (1RCT n=29, RR 2.81 CI 0.1 to 63.8) than placebo. However as the comparison was between very small groups (14 versus 15 participants) it is still possible that these events are really more prevalent in the molindone than the placebo group and this may deserve further investigation in a trial with larger sample sizes and greater statistical power. In the same study, rates of drowsiness, hypotension, dysphagia, weight loss or lactation were not significantly different between groups. Abnormal laboratory findings were seen more frequently in the placebo group than in the molindone group (1RCT n=29, RR 0.36 CI 0.2 to 0.8, NNT 2 CI 2 to 5). No patients reported weight gain on either molindone or placebo.</P>
<P>2.5. Missing outcomes<BR/>No studies reported on mortality, service utilisation, economic outcomes, quality of life or satisfaction with care.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2. MOLINDONE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>3.1. Global assessment<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>) defined 'Not Improved' as a CGI-I score of &gt;3, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>) used an unspecified global rating scale with categories 'worse' or 'no change' signifying the outcome 'Not Improved' and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1971</LINK>) again used an unspecified global ratings scale with the outcome 'Not Improved' being indicated by the categories 'no change', 'minimally worse' or 'very much worse'. In all three studies, ratings were performed independently by doctors and nurses. <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1969</LINK> used the NOSIE scale to assess patients' global state, and <LINK REF="STD-Dufresne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dufresne 1993</LINK> used both the CGI and the BPRS scales to define global effect.</P>
<P>The doctors' ratings showed no significant difference between molindone and typical antipsychotics (4RCTs n=150, RR 1.10, CI 0.68 to 1.78); for the nurses' ratings, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>) showed a difference, in favour of the comparator drugs (1RCT n=30, RR 2.00, CI 1.02 to 3.9, NNH 3 CI 2 to 126), but this difference was no longer significant when the studies were pooled (4 RCTs n=146, RR 1.11, CI 0.76 to 1.64).</P>
<P>The heterogeneity test was significant for the nurses' ratings, when the study with an attrition rate of more than 25% was removed (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1971</LINK>) the doctors and the nurses ratings still found no significant difference between molindone and typical antipsychotics and there was still significant heterogeneity in the nurses' assessment.</P>
<P>3.2. Mental State<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Dufresne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dufresne 1993</LINK> found a difference in favour of the control group in the rate of confusion, as measured by the TESS scale (1RCT n=44, RR 3.21, CI 1.42 to 7.26, NNH 3 CI 2 to 12). <LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1993</LINK> found no significant difference in BPRS endpoint scores between molindone and typical antipsychotics (n=45).</P>
<P>3.3. Leaving the study early <BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Itil-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Itil 1972</LINK>) measured numbers discharged from hospital following successful treatment; the numbers were exactly the same (18/30) in the molindone and the typical antipsychotic groups.</P>
<P>No significant differences were seen in the numbers leaving the study early for negative reasons between molindone and typical antipsychotics, in any of the six studies (n=241) that reported this outcome. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dufresne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dufresne 1993</LINK>) reported the outcome 'leaving the study early due to adverse events' and again no significant differences were found between the groups (n=44).</P>
<P>3.4. Side-effects<BR/>3.4.1 Any adverse effects<BR/>Three studies (n= 84) reported the outcome 'any adverse effect' (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1970</LINK>); none of them found any significant difference between the molindone group and the typical antipsychotic group.</P>
<P>3.4.2 Movement disorders<BR/>The following movement disorders were reported: rigidity/tremor (immediate, short and medium term, 5RCTs n=181), dystonia (immediate, short and medium term, 4RCTs n=151), akathisia (immediate, short and medium term, 5RCTs n=181), use of antiparkinsonian medication (5RCTs n=185), akinesia (1RCT n=40), hypokinesia (1RCT n=45), hyperkinesia (1RCT n=45), increased motor activity (1RCT n=30), decreased motor activity (1RCT n=30) and cramps (1RCT n=30). No significant differences were seen between the molindone and typical antipsychotic groups for any of the outcomes. A sensitivity analysis excluding studies with attrition of more than 25% made no difference to the results for relative risk.</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity between the pooled studies for the side effect 'rigidity/ tremor' which remained when the studies with attrition &gt;25% were excluded from the analysis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Escobar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Escobar 1985</LINK>) used injectable molindone in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, whereas the others used oral medication in people with chronic schizophrenia. In one of the oral dose studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>) the comparator drug was trifluoperazine, in the other two it was chlorpromazine. It is also possible that the duration of illness varied between trials, as this was poorly reported. All sample sizes were small (n&lt;25).</P>
<P>The pooled analysis for the side effect 'use of antiparkinsonian medication' also displayed borderline significant heterogeneity, which increased when the study with &gt;25% attrition was excluded. The study in which the result appeared to be different from the other three was <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>. It is unclear how this study may differ from the other three, as each reported characteristic of the participants and trial design is shared with at least one of the other studies, apart from the fact that people in the <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK> study were reported to have negative symptoms. </P>
<P>AIMS scores for <LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1990</LINK> (n= 18) showed that haloperidol was more effective than molindone at masking symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.<BR/> <BR/>3.4.3 Adverse behavioural side effects<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>) found that equal numbers of patients (2/12) in each group experienced adverse behavioural side effects.</P>
<P>3.4.4 Abnormal laboratory findings<BR/>Two studies measured abnormal laboratory findings (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>) and the results favoured molindone (2RCTs n=54, RR 0.38, CI 0.19 to 0.76, NNT 3 CI 3 to 8). However, the <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK> study, which used chlorpromazine as a comparator, dominated the results (1RCT n=30, RR 0.36, CI 0.17 to 0.74). The <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK> study, which used trifluoperazine as a comparator, found no significant differences between the two groups (1RCT n=24, RR 0.50, CI 0.05 to 4.81).</P>
<P>3.4.5 Autonomic nervous system effects<BR/>In the one study where these were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK> n=24), no significant difference was found between molindone and typical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>3.4.6 Sleep problems<BR/>Drowsiness (immediate, short and medium term) and insomnia were found to be equally prevalent in both groups (4RCTs n=152). A sensitivity analysis excluding the one study with attrition of more than 25% (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1971</LINK>) gave a statistically significant result for drowsiness in favour of molindone (3RCTs n=100, RR 0.54, CI 0.32 to 0.91). Significant heterogeneity was found for this result in this group of trials, which increased when the sensitivity analysis was performed. The trial which looked to have a different result from the other two was <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>. It is unclear how this study differed in design or participants from <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1969</LINK>, although the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Escobar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Escobar 1985</LINK>) used injectable medication in acutely disturbed people with schizophrenia. However, sample sizes were small in all cases (n&lt;28).</P>
<P>3.4.7 Cardiovascular problems<BR/>Hypotension (1RCT n=30), dizziness (1RCT n=30), tachycardia (1RCT n=60) and QRST changes (1RCT n=60) were found to be equally prevalent in both groups.</P>
<P>3.4.8 Gastrointestinal problems<BR/>No significant differences were found in rates of constipation (2RCTs n=82), hiccough (1RCT n=52) or nausea and vomiting (2RCTs n=82) between those given molindone and those given typical antipsychotics. A sensitivity analysis, excluding the study with over 25% attrition, did not alter these results.</P>
<P>3.4.9 Other problems<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Escobar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Escobar 1985</LINK>) found that people taking molindone experienced significantly more weight loss than people taking typical antipsychotics (2RCTs n=60, RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77). The same two studies showed a borderline statistically significant result for the outcome of weight gain, with fewer people taking molindone experiencing weight gain than those taking typical antipsychotics (2RCTs n=60, RR 0.39, CI 0.15 to 1.00).<BR/>The following side effects were equally prevalent in both groups: lactation (1RCT n=30), dysphagia (1RCT n=30), anorexia (1RCT n=30), dry mouth (2RCTs n=82), blurred vision (2RCTs n=82), increased salivation (2RCTs n=82), joint pain (1RCT n=30), muscle pain (1RCT n=30), increased appetite (1RCT n=30), headache (1RCT n=30), worsening of cataracts (1RCT n=60), depression (1RCT n=52), nasal congestion (1RCT n=52), feeling weak (1RCT n=52), toxic confusional state (1RCT n=52), drooling (1RCT n=24) and 'dizzy, faint or weak' (1RCT n=24). A sensitivity analysis, removing the study whose attrition rate was more than 25%, did not alter these results.</P>
<P>3.5. Missing outcomes<BR/>Only one study reported on hospital discharge after successful treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Itil-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Itil 1972</LINK>). No studies reported on economic outcomes, quality of life or satisfaction with care. No study reassured the reader as regards mortality.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of findings<BR/>Most studies were set in North America and randomised those with disorders uncomplicated by additional problems. Six of the fourteen included studies included only those operationally diagnosed with schizophrenia. Such practices must limit the generalisability of the review's findings. </P>
<P>2. Limited data<BR/>The collection and quality of reporting of data is disappointing. No trials report outcomes at more than 13 weeks. In four trials, it was even unclear whether randomisation had been performed. Intention to treat analysis was usually not possible as most studies did not report, or incompletely reported, dropout. No studies reported on economic outcomes, quality of life or directly on satisfaction with care. However, most of the trial reports were published before the year of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) which encouraged high standards of trial reporting. These trials only achieved a quality rating of 'B' (poor) except one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>) which received a quality rating of 'A' (good) after extra information was provided by the trial author.</P>
<P>3. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias<BR/>It was not possible to undertake either a funnel graph or a sensitivity analysis for people with schizophrenia described as 'treatment resistant', people having predominantly positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia and people experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia. The very small number of full studies with useful data, the exclusion of patients who were treatment-resistant and the inclusion of mainly those with chronic schizophrenia as opposed to first episode schizophrenia precluded such activities. </P>
<P>We undertook a sensitivity analysis investigating the effect of excluding studies with attrition rates from 25-50% for the comparison of molindone versus typical antipsychotics; however, we did not include all studies in the analysis as some did not report attrition rates. </P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 1. MOLINDONE versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>4.1. Global effect<BR/>There are limited usable data on outcomes of global functioning but those that exist do not favour either molindone or placebo. However small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals prevent any conclusions being drawn on the comparative effects of molindone and placebo.</P>
<P>4.2. Missing outcomes<BR/>No data were collected on patient quality of life or satisfaction with treatment or care. Data on service utilisation and social and economic outcomes were also missing. That such outcomes, of key importance to recipients of care, clinicians and managers/policy makers, are absent suggests that these studies were not undertaken primarily to convince these groups of the value of molindone. </P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 2. MOLINDONE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>5.1. Global improvement.<BR/>In the initial analysis, using the same rating scale separately, both doctors and nurses found no significant difference in global functioning between groups. When the study with the highest attrition rate is removed, according to the sensitivity analysis stated a priori, both doctors and nurses still found no difference between groups. </P>
<P>5.2. Mental state<BR/>One study, which simply measured BPRS endpoint scores, found no difference between molindone and typical antipsychotics. It appears that molindone is as effective as thioridIzine, haloperidol or chlorpromazine for these outcomes, although the sample sizes were small. According to one study, molindone caused more confusion than typical comparator drugs.</P>
<P>5.3. Leaving the study early<BR/>People treated with molindone and people treated with typical comparator drugs left the studies in equivalent numbers, indicating that molindone is as acceptable to people with schizophrenia as the typical drugs.</P>
<P>Equal numbers were discharged from hospital following successful treatment when molindone was compared with trifluoperazine, again indicating that molindone is as effective as the typical comparator drug.</P>
<P>5.4. Adverse effects<BR/>People receiving molindone did not have significantly different rates of most adverse events than those receiving a comparator drug. When molindone was compared with chlorpromazine, more people in the chlorpromazine group had abnormal laboratory findings, but when molindone was compared to trifluoperazine, rates of abnormal laboratory findings were not significantly different between the groups.</P>
<P>People receiving molindone experienced significantly more weight loss than those receiving chlorpromazine or haloperidol. This may be a harmful or a beneficial effect, depending on the baseline characteristics of the patients to whom it is given. Weight gain may be a problem associated with alternative antipsychotic drugs, or chronic schizophrenic patients may be obese due to previous medications, and in these patients weight loss would be seen as a beneficial side effect of molindone.</P>
<P>Weight gain may have been less of a problem in the molindone group than in the comparator groups, but the result did not achieve statistical significance according to stated a priori criteria. \</P>
<P>Molindone was found to be significantly less likely to cause drowsiness than typical comparator drugs, when studies with attrition rate &gt;25% (i.e. lower quality studies) were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>Molindone was less likely than haloperidol to mask symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (<LINK REF="STD-Glazer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Glazer 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>6. COMPARISON 3. MOLINDONE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS<BR/>We found no studies which compared molindone to atypical antipsychotics. In view of its apparent equivalence to typical antipsychotics, as noted in comparison 2, such trials are probably unnecessary.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. Those with schizophrenia<BR/>The limited data available suggest that molindone is as clinically effective and acceptable as chlorpromazine, haloperidol and trifluoperazine for those with schizophrenia and other severe psychoses. It is no more or less likely than these other drugs to cause movement disorders but it causes weight loss. </P>
<P>2. Clinicians<BR/>Useful data on this drug are limited. There is no evidence to support the use of molindone for specific subtypes of schizophrenia, such as treatment resistant, or those with predominantly negative symptoms. There is no evidence that molindone causes fewer movement disorders than other typical antipsychotics, but it may cause less weight gain. The evidence suggests that molindone causes more weight loss than other typical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>3. Managers or policy makers<BR/>No data relating to care management or economics were reported. Molindone was as effective as another typical antipsychotic drug, trifluoperazine, for discharge from hospital of successfully treated patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>Clear and strict adherence to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) for all outcomes would have resulted in this review being more informative. Denominator data were not always clearly presented and some results were described as 'significant' or not, but numbers were not reported. Authors should present raw data on the numbers randomised, to permit an intention-to-treat analysis to be performed. If p-values are used, the exact value should be reported as well as the test employed. If data are presented in a graph, the exact numbers represented by the graph should also be reported.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>Better planned, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials are needed to run over longer periods and to address clinically and socially relevant outcomes. Data relating to global functioning, mental state and behaviour need replication and expansion. High quality trial-derived data about hospital admission, satisfaction with care, social functioning, family burden and employment would be of great interest. Larger trials comparing molindone to typical comparators would be of interest, as would useful cost-effectiveness data.</P>
