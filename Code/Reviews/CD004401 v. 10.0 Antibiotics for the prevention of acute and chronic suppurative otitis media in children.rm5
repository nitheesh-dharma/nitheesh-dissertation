<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-01 09:10:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM, infection in the middle ear space) is common in children, causing pain and deafness. Most children experience at least one episode and some children suffer recurrent AOM (more than three episodes in six months or four episodes in 12 months), and some progress to eardrum perforation. Interventions (antibiotics, vaccines or reduced exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens) that decrease the frequency and/or the severity of infection are needed. Antibiotics given once or twice daily may reduce episodes of bacterial AOM and their complications. This review included 17 studies (1586 children). Long-term antibiotics (equal to or more than six weeks) almost halved the risk of further infections. There was not enough information to know if antibiotics reduced acute otitis media with perforation or chronic suppurative otitis media (chronic perforation), or improved long-term outcomes. Antibiotics did not appear to be a frequent cause of significant side effects (for example, allergic reactions or diarrhea). Parents must balance these potential side effects plus the cost and inconvenience associated with antibiotics against the likely benefits of treatment. Antibiotic resistance from the long-term use of these drugs is also an issue which should be considered, particularly for children with recurring infections.</P>

<P>Seventeen studies (1586 children) were included. All studies enrolled children at increased risk of AOM. In seven studies the children were prone to otitis media. The majority were high-quality studies and most (16 studies) reported data for our primary outcomes. One reported AOM with perforation or CSOM. Long-term antibiotics reduced any episode of AOM (14 studies, 1461 children, risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.79; random-effects model) and number of episodes of AOM (13 studies, 1327 children, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.66; random-effects model). Approximately five children would need to be treated long-term to prevent one child experiencing AOM whilst on treatment. Antibiotics prevented 1.5 episodes of AOM for every 12 months of treatment per child. We explored statistical heterogeneity. Long-term antibiotics were not associated with a significant increase in adverse events (12 studies, 817 children, RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 15.89; random-effects model).</P>

<P>For children at risk, antibiotics given once or twice daily will reduce the probability of AOM while the child is on treatment. In similar populations, antibiotics will reduce the number of episodes of AOM per year from around three to around 1.5. We believe that larger absolute benefits are likely in high-risk children. These conclusions were not affected by sensitivity analyses.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-29 21:32:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Otitis media is a major health problem in young children. Otitis media (OM) is a broad term for any infection or inflammation occurring in the middle ear space (behind the tympanic membrane). It represents a spectrum of disease: i) otitis media with effusion (OME), fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane without the symptoms or signs of acute otitis media; ii) acute otitis media (AOM), fluid behind the tympanic membrane with the symptoms or signs of an acute infection; and iii) chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), persistent discharge of pus through a perforated tympanic membrane for more than six weeks. The criteria used in definitions of AOM are highly variable. Ear pain (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2003</LINK>), bulging of the tympanic membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Karma-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karma 1989</LINK>) and recent discharge of pus are regarded as the most diagnostically reliable. In populations with high rates of CSOM, it is helpful to distinguish between those children with AOM without perforation and those children with perforation of the tympanic membrane, since AOM with perforation always precedes CSOM. Children who have had three episodes of AOM within the last six months or four episodes within the last 12 months are classified as having recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A comprehensive search of <I>The Cochrane Library</I> and MEDLINE identified the following systematic reviews of interventions for AOM: antibiotics for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kozyrskyj-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozyrskyj 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2009</LINK>); decongestants or antihistamines, or both for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2008</LINK>); antibiotics for prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Bonati-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonati 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>); and pneumococcal vaccines for prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Jansen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 2009</LINK>). The systematic review of antibiotics to prevent AOM by Williams et al (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>) found that antibiotics reduced the rate of AOM by 50%. However, AOM was infrequent (the AOM recurrence rate in the control groups was 0.062 to 0.488 per patient-month) and each child required around 10 months of treatment to prevent one episode of infection. Similar overall results were reported in a more recent evidence summary (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2003</LINK>). In this meta-analysis, studies with placebo groups having higher AOM recurrence rates (more than 0.2 episodes per month) showed a rate difference of 0.18 episodes per month (95% CI 0.08 to 0.28) compared to a rate difference of 0.06 episodes per month (95% CI 0.04 to 0.09) for studies where placebo groups that had lower recurrence rates. The studies included in these reviews were largely conducted in the USA or other industrialised countries. In these settings the pain or fever associated with an episode of AOM is the principle concern of the care-giver. However, in disadvantaged populations the potential progression to CSOM is more important. In addition to constant offensive discharge, the hearing loss associated with this severe disease is likely to have a great impact on the language development and behaviour of young children. Not surprisingly, the World Health Organization's hearing preservation group has stated that populations with children having a 4% rate of CSOM have a massive public health problem.</P>
<P>Indigenous children living in Australia, North America, Northern Europe and New Zealand appear to be at particularly high risk of developing CSOM (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_CIBA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/CIBA 1996</LINK>). In a recent cross-sectional survey of children aged six months to 2.5 years and living in 29 remote communities in the Northern Territory, rates of perforation varied from less than 10% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2005</LINK>). In longitudinal birth cohort studies in this population the onset of disease has been shown to commence within weeks of life, following nasopharyngeal colonisation with <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)</I>, non-capsular <I>Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) </I>(NCHi) and <I>Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis)</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Leach-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1994</LINK>). This association between bacterial colonisation and early-onset OM has led to speculation about the role of long-term antibiotic therapy.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-07-13 10:03:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic antibiotics have been recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial infection in selected children. For children at high risk of bacterial OM, oral antibiotics active against <I>S. pneumoniae</I> and <I>H. influenzae</I> can be given once or twice daily. The duration of prophylaxis may vary from weeks to months.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-24 14:40:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic antibiotics might either reduce nasopharyngeal colonisation with pathogens or reduce the risk of colonised children developing clinically apparent bacterial infections. Antibiotics should not affect the incidence of viral upper respiratory tract infections.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-07-13 10:04:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While antibiotics appear to reduce rates of subsequent AOM in high-income countries, important questions remain concerning the relative benefits and costs in populations at high risk of AOM or CSOM. The original systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bonati-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonati 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>) have not been updated with the publication of new studies. In addition, the impact of this intervention in high-risk populations is unclear.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of long-term antibiotics (equal to or more than six weeks) versus control (placebo or no treatment) for the prevention of AOM without perforation, AOM with perforation and CSOM. Ideally episodes of AOM should be least two weeks apart. While definitions vary substantially between studies, AOM should be confirmed by otoscopy. All episodes of AOM that were associated with perforation were categorised as AOM with perforation even if the tympanic membrane was intact at the time of examination (that is to say, perforations occurred within two weeks of the clinical assessment and not secondary to trauma). Similarly we attempted to limit the diagnosis of CSOM to episodes of discharge from the middle ear that persisted for longer than six weeks. Ideally, resolution of discharge associated with CSOM was confirmed by a clinician. Cross-over studies were eligible for inclusion but we only used data from the initial treatment period. There were no language or publication restrictions.</P>

<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, we calculated risk ratio and absolute risk reductions using an ITT analysis. For the incidence rate variables of each individual study, we estimated the log of the incidence rate ratio and the log of the standard error from the raw data using Stata version 7.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Stata-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 2004</LINK>). In cases where one of the comparison groups had a rate of zero, one case was added to both groups. We carried out an initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analyzed studies to determine whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This took into account differences in study populations, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment and estimated effect size.</P>

<P>We included the results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and that reported any of the outcomes of interest in the subsequent meta-analyses. We calculated the summary weighted risk ratio and 95% CI by the Mantel-Haenszel method using a fixed-effect model (Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used the number of episodes of AOM and illness per child-year to calculate the summary weighted incidence rate ratio by the generic inverse variance method (Cochrane statistical package, <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We calculated the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat using the summary odds ratio and the average control event rate described in the relevant studies. This was done by multiplying the odds of the event in the control arm by the odds ratio to determine the odds of the event in the intervention arm. We then converted the estimated odds to probabilities. </P>

<P>We identified 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. However one study reported acute otitis media (AOM) combined with otitis media with effusion (OME) as their outcome measure and was not able to contribute any data to the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1982a</LINK>). Sixteen studies are included in the meta-analysis. Fifteen of the studies were identified through searching the databases described above. All of these were listed on MEDLINE. We were notified about one additional study that had been published as an extended abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1981</LINK>). Four of the studies used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Liston-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Liston 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrin-1974a" TYPE="STUDY">Perrin 1974a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1985a</LINK>).

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-12-01 09:11:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>All the 16 studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses randomized young children who were regarded as being at increased risk of AOM. In seven studies the children met the accepted criteria for being prone to otitis (three episodes in the previous six months or four episodes in the previous 12 months). At least half the studies excluded children who had congenital abnormalities associated with increased rates of OM (for example, cleft palate and immunodeficiency). Most studies were conducted in the USA and were completed prior to 1990. The most commonly used long-term antibiotic treatments were sulphisoxazole and amoxicillin. Nearly all of the studies were placebo-controlled. The long-term antibiotics were generally given for three to six months. Antibiotics were given once or twice daily. Most studies used a combination of active surveillance (with monthly reviews) and visits to a healthcare provider because of illness to document episodes of AOM. The diagnostic criteria used for AOM were variable but generally children had to have symptoms and signs consistent with the illness. Relatively few studies provided data on the long-term outcomes following cessation of intervention.</P>
<P>The age eligibility criteria for the 16 studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses varied. Three studies specifically targeted children less than 18 months of age (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teele-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Teele 2000a</LINK>). Two additional studies did not enrol children older then 30 to 35 months of age (<LINK REF="STD-Casselbrant-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Casselbrant 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persico-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Persico 1985a</LINK>). The other 11 studies did not exclude older children. Most children in the studies were younger than five years of age.</P>
<P>All the studies randomized children at increased risk of AOM. This was consistent with the criteria for recurrent AOM (three episodes in six months or four episodes in 12 months) in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casselbrant-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Casselbrant 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liston-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Liston 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persico-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Persico 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Principi-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roark-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Roark 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuller-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Schuller 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1985a</LINK>).

One study enrolled children who had experienced an episode of AOM in the first six months of life or two episodes in the first 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Teele-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Teele 2000a</LINK>). One study enrolled children with frequent middle ear effusion (MEE) but infrequent AOM (<LINK REF="STD-Mandel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 1996a</LINK>).

<P>None of the 11 studies that described ear status at entry to the study included children with AOM at the start of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Casselbrant-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Casselbrant 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaskins-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Gaskins 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liston-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Liston 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Principi-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Principi 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuller-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Schuller 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sih-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Sih 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varsano-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Varsano 1985a</LINK>).

<P>The overall quality was high with nine studies providing a description of the random assignment or stating random assignment and providing group similarity details, and nine studies providing adequate information on allocation concealment. Fourteen studies had at least the outcome assessor blinded. Nine studies reported outcomes for all randomized children in each group; 10 studies measured outcomes in over 90% of participants and evaluated withdrawals as treatment failures. Standardised assessments were used in 14 studies. Agreement was highest for blinding (agreement 94%, kappa 0.76) and reporting by allocated group (agreement 88%, kappa 0.75); and lowest for allocation concealment (agreement 69%, kappa 0.35) and outcome assessment (agreement 81%, kappa -0.1).

<P>Seventeen studies involving 1586 children met our inclusion criteria. All studies enrolled children at increased risk of AOM and in seven studies the children met the accepted criteria for being prone to otitis (three episodes in the previous six months or four episodes in the previous 12 months). Most eligible studies reported data on our two primary outcomes (14 studies reported on any AOM and 13 studies reported on rates of AOM). One study combined AOM and otitis media with effusion (OME) episodes and thus contributed no data to this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1982a</LINK>). Long-term antibiotics reduced any episode of AOM and the number of episodes of AOM. The benefits were modest (absolute risk reduction of 20%) but highly statistically significant. The results of individual studies were statistically heterogeneous but this was not sufficient to prevent pooling of studies. No study described the proportion of children with recurrent AOM or CSOM at end of treatment. Only one study provided data on long-term outcomes. Clinical side effects of treatment were reported in 12 studies. In these studies, the use of long-term antibiotics was not associated with a significant increase in adverse events.</P>
<P>For the following prespecified analyses there were no data available and no forest plots produced: i) Prevention - any AOM or CSOM following cessation of intervention at one to two months, three to five months, 12 to 23 months, and more than 23 months; ii) Prevention - any AOM or CSOM during intervention in high-risk children; and iii) Prevention - episodes of AOM or CSOM during intervention in high-risk children.</P>

Overall, 293 of 800 children (37%) in the antibiotic group and 368 of 661 children (56%) in the control group experienced at least one episode of AOM during the intervention period. The pooled risk ratio was 0.65 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.79; random-effects model, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%). We estimated that this is equivalent to an absolute risk reduction of 21%. In other words, you would need to treat five children (95% CI 4 to 6) with long-term antibiotics to prevent one child experiencing an episode of AOM while on treatment.</P>

The studies were statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73%). The average rate of AOM in children in the control group was around three episodes per child-year. Assuming the effect of antibiotics persists over any treatment period, a child (typical of those included in these trials) will have their rate of AOM reduced to 1.5 episodes per year. That is to say, on average, antibiotics will prevent 1.5 episodes of AOM for every 12 months of treatment per child.</P>

<P>We conducted a range of sensitivity analyses. In all of these meta-analyses (excluding compliance) the pooled effect size remained consistent with the overall pooled effect size for both primary outcomes. The studies included in this meta-analysis were statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%). This statistical heterogeneity was less marked (but still significant) if the odds ratio rather than risk ratio was used (P = 0.06, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 42%). We used the sensitivity analyses to explore the potential causes of this heterogeneity. All of the planned sensitivity analyses provided pooled estimates of effect that were consistent with the overall estimate (see below). Visual assessment of the funnel plot asymmetry identified four smaller studies that described the largest effect of antibiotics (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.54; random-effects model, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1972a" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1972a</LINK>) reported any AOM/CSOM; a greater benefit of antibiotics over placebo was seen in the high compliance group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76) compared to a non-significant benefit in the not high compliance group (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.19).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strength of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The evidence contained within this review is consistent with antibiotics preventing any AOM in children at risk of future infections. This conclusion is based on the results of 14 RCTs involving 1461 children. The estimated effect size was a 35% reduction in risk of experiencing any episode of AOM (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.79 for any episode of AOM). In the 13 RCTs involving 1215 children, a similar reduction in episodes of AOM/CSOM during the intervention period was described (IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.66 for rates of AOM). These results were not substantially affected by a range of sensitivity analyses. The clinical importance of this beneficial effect was limited by the spontaneous reduction in rates of AOM over time in children not receiving treatment. If these studies are valid, and there is no publication bias, the probability that antibiotics appeared effective by chance alone is remote. More than half of the studies used appropriate methods of randomisation and blinding. The effect size tended to be slightly larger in the studies that were of poorer quality or were small. However, exclusion of these studies had little impact on the pooled effect size.</P>
<P>Overall, the observed beneficial effect of antibiotics cannot be explained by bias or co-intervention. The pooled effect size was also clinically consistent with the results from individual studies. However, there was some statistical heterogeneity that could not be easily explained. There may be other factors not measured in the individual studies that influence outcome. The conclusion that antibiotics are effective in the prevention of AOM is supported by the knowledge that AOM is often a bacterial infection, which antibiotics act to resolve (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2003</LINK>). While this review provides strong evidence that antibiotics are effective in preventing AOM during the intervention period, the long-term effects of the intervention remain uncertain. Long-term use of antibiotics should take into account the possibility of developing antibiotic resistance and side effects, which are discussed in the 'Trade-offs' section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Nearly all studies were conducted in developed countries and only two studies involved a population of children at high risk of long-term complications such as CSOM (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1972a" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1972a</LINK>). Most studies enrolled children with a history of recurrent AOM. While there was statistical heterogeneity in the results this could not be explained by biologic or cultural variation, variation in compliance, or variation in baseline risk.</P>
<P>Although antibiotics will prevent AOM, the overall beneficial effect is not large. This is because rates of AOM generally decreased even in children randomized to placebo or no treatment. The control event rate for any AOM during the intervention period varied from 40% to 85%. Overall, 56% of children enrolled in these trials and randomized to the control group experienced one or more episodes of AOM; they experienced around three episodes of AOM per child-year. This review did provide some evidence that the relative benefit of antibiotics was reasonably consistent across a range of risk groups. Therefore, the potential benefit is most readily determined by the baseline risk. Since the risk of disease also tends to resolve spontaneously over time, children who have either persistently frequent or severe episodes of AOM are most likely to benefit. For children living in temperate climates the baseline risk is considerably higher during winter (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other relevant information</HEADING>
<P>The results of this systematic review are consistent with previous systematic reviews and evidence summaries of the use of antibiotics to prevent AOM. They are also consistent with the size of the beneficial effect described in the systematic review of pneumococcal vaccines. Antibiotics have also been shown to be similarly effective in treating AOM and other mucosal respiratory infections such as sore throat, persistent rhinosinusitis and bronchitis.</P>
<P>There is some evidence that the frequency of AOM diagnosed by clinicians has increased but the severity of episodes (as determined by tympanic membrane perforation) has decreased. If we assume that the total number of respiratory infections experienced by young children has not changed substantially, it may be that clinicians are identifying AOM in children previously thought to have a non-specific viral upper respiratory infection. Whether the reduction in tympanic membrane perforations is due to changes in the severity or aetiology of the infection or earlier treatment is not clear. An appreciation of the size of the beneficial effect of antibiotics, the low risk of long-term complications like CSOM, and the association between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance has meant that clinicians in high-income countries are encouraged to withhold antibiotics wherever feasible (<LINK REF="REF-Dowell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowell 1999</LINK>). While this approach is reasonable, clinicians should be aware that this decision is based on a trade-off between the benefits and risks of treatment</P>
<P>For clinicians using antibiotics to prevent AOM in children, local knowledge of the resistance patterns of the infecting organisms may be helpful. Rates of infection with penicillin-resistant and multi-resistant pneumococci have increased dramatically since the mid-1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Dowell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowell 1999</LINK>). Since no studies have been conducted since this time, this review was unable to assess the impact of these changes. More recently, the introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has meant that rates of penicillin-resistant infection are likely to decrease again in countries with a universal childhood immunisation programme.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Trade-offs</HEADING>
<P>It would appear that the benefit of antibiotics must be weighed up against the cost and inconvenience of therapy and the risk of occasional side effects. Although the increase in side effects was not statistically significant in this review, it is generally accepted that antibiotics are associated with a small increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects and allergic reactions. How often these effects lead to withdrawal of the intervention is unclear. In the studies included within this review only 10 of 405 children in the antibiotic group and three of 309 children in the control group experienced significant side effects. Not all studies in this review reported on side effects or antibiotic resistance, hence there are limitations to the power of this meta-analysis to detect potentially important adverse events or antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics may also influence the prevalence of antibiotic resistance within the community. This was only reported by two of the studies included within the review (<LINK REF="STD-Casselbrant-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Casselbrant 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 1996a</LINK>). Although there was an increase in carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci or haemophilus in both studies, the pooled estimate was not statistically significant. While this remains an important issue, the hypothesis that antibiotic use leads to increased antibiotic resistance has still not been tested in appropriate large randomized controlled trials. Increasing antibiotic resistance may also limit the potential benefits of this therapy. Local knowledge of epidemiology, aetiology and resistance patterns is likely to be helpful. In addition to these potential side effects, the cost of purchasing the medication and the inconvenience of giving it to young children as instructed must also be taken into account.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-13 12:13:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of episodic AOM while on treatment by 20% to 50% (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This is equivalent to a reduction of one to two episodes per year of treatment. In the studies included in this review, prophylactic antibiotics were not associated with a significant increase in side effects (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-10-30 16:07:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a reasonable amount of evidence about the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on episodic AOM without perforation in children living in high-income countries. There is still uncertainty about the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on episodic AOM with perforation and CSOM, and the impact on all forms of AOM in children living in low-income countries. The results are consistent across the studies. The pooled estimates of effect are likely to be applicable to similar populations.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-11-29 21:03:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, 17 RCTs (1586 children) have addressed this research question. The quality of evidence included in this review is generally high (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The results across the studies are consistent. The pooled estimates of effect are likely to be internally valid and qualitatively reliable. However, sensitivity analyses of high-quality studies (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>), suggest the true effect may be more modest than that described.</P>

<P>The most important limitation of this review is that publication or small study bias cannot be excluded (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The methods used in this review are unlikely to have introduced bias. Both review authors were investigators of one included study.</P>

<P>The findings of this systematic review are similar to the findings of other systematic reviews and evidence-based guidelines. Although the evidence for individual studies appears consistent, the expert opinion about the role of prophylactic antibiotics has changed over time. Currently, many experts propose that the risk of antibiotic resistance outweighs the benefit of reduced infection.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-01 09:11:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-12-01 09:11:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Parents should be advised that, for children at risk of future episodes of AOM, the available evidence suggests that antibiotics given once or twice daily will reduce the probability of AOM while the child is on treatment. The effects of antibiotics beyond the treatment period are unclear. The benefits indicate that around five children must be treated in order for one child to avoid experiencing one or more episodes of AOM. A typical otitis-prone child who has experienced at least three episodes of AOM in the previous six months (or at least four episodes in the previous 12 months) will have an average rate of AOM of around three episodes in the next year even if they receive no treatment. Antibiotics will reduce the rate of AOM to 1.5 episodes per year (that is to say, antibiotics will prevent 1.5 episodes of AOM for every 12 months of treatment per child). Larger absolute benefits are likely in children who have more frequent or more severe AOM. These conclusions are based on a large number of randomized controlled trials and are not affected by sensitivity analyses. The overall pooled estimate of effect is unlikely to change dramatically as additional data become available.</P>
<P>Antibiotics are not without risk. In these studies around one additional child experienced diarrhea or an allergic reaction for every 100 treated. This difference was not statistically significant. Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing may also contribute to increasing rates of antibiotic resistance. Parents or children who place greatest value on avoidance of any further episodes of AOM during the treatment period and who are willing to risk the possible side effects associated with this intervention are most likely to choose antibiotic therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-04-15 15:17:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite increasing concern about inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for the prevention of AOM, this intervention is associated with some benefits. The challenge is to now identify the children for whom the absolute benefits outweigh the potential risks of long-term antibiotic treatment. Consequently, large simple trials comparing the effects of antibiotics with placebo in children at greatest risk of complications of AOM, children at high risk (children with previous perforation), and children living in high-risk populations would provide useful information. Children should be stratified according to the frequency and severity of previous infections. Outcomes should be assessed at the completion of the intervention and again at least three to six months later. Additional research is needed to examine the impact of antibiotics on the bacteria infecting the nasopharynx. Any subsequent increases in antibiotic resistance should be described.</P>

<P>Protocol amendment: the outcome colonised with resistant <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> or <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> was limited to the first follow-up visit following treatment, and at least six weeks after starting treatment. Although this meant that some of the data from some studies that measured antibiotic resistance at multiple time points was not used, we decided that the estimates of antibiotic resistance would become more comparable across a range of studies (27 August 2003).</P>
