<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Oral vasodilator drugs to reduce the symptoms of primary Raynaud's phenomenon</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Raynaud's phenomenon is caused by short term constriction of the small arteries in the extremities, usually the fingers. For a few minutes, usually, the fingertips go white and feel numb or tingle and prickle. Then the blood flow returns and they become warm and red, which can also be painful. For some people the toes, ears, nose, tongue or nipples are affected. Cold or emotional stress can trigger the attacks. Keeping warm, stopping smoking and avoiding using tools that vibrate can prevent attacks but sometimes drug therapy is needed. Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine are the drugs of choice but can have unwanted side effects. </P>
<P>The review looked at the effectiveness of other drugs that can be taken by mouth. These were drugs that increase blood flow (vasodilators). The evidence from randomised controlled trials is limited. The review authors identified eight controlled studies. These were published between 1980 and 1996 and involved a total of 290 participants randomly assigned to the vasodilator drug or placebo. The length of treatment varied from two weeks to six months. Only two trials looked at the same drug, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril so most of the findings were from single trials. Taking enalapril resulted in a small increase in the frequency of attacks in a week. Buflomedil reduced the frequency of attacks but without a clear effect on their severity. Moxisylyte (thymoxamine) also reduced attacks but both beraprost and moxisylyte produced more adverse effects than with placebo. For captopril, beraprost, dazoxiben and ketanserin there was no evidence of an effect on the frequency, severity or duration of attacks. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of most trials was poor and they were small. The outcomes were subjective and were reported on scales that were not well described or validated. This makes the clinical importance of the results difficult to assess, especially if the placebo response is high.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-04 11:31:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Raynaud's phenomenon was first described by Maurice Raynaud in 1862 (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 1998</LINK>). It is a common disorder characterised by episodes of vasospasm (constriction) of the small arteries in the fingers as a response to exposure to cold, resulting in the classical well-demarcated whitening of one or more of the finger tips, sometimes followed by cyanosis. There may be pain and an abnormal sensation such as numbness or prickling sensation (paraesthesia). This is followed by a reactive increase in the blood flow (hyperaemia) to the finger upon reperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 1998</LINK>). Fingers are most often affected, but in more severe cases the toes, ears, nose, tongue or nipples may be involved (<LINK REF="REF-Prodigy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>In this review, the term primary Raynaud's phenomenon has been used for what is also called Raynaud's disease or idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon. The term secondary Raynaud's phenomenon has been used for what is also called Raynaud's syndrome. Primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon are defined according to the absence or presence of underlying disease. There is a wide range of causes of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. The most frequent and well known are connective tissue diseases, most often systemic sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). Raynaud's phenomenon may be a side effect of some drugs; well known are beta blockers, ergotamines, interferon alpha, cyclosporine, and some antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents. Among other causes are hypothyroidism, carpal tunnel syndrome, neoplasms including paraneoplastic syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome and hand-arm vibration syndrome caused by occupational exposure to mechanical vibration (<LINK REF="REF-Prodigy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy 2006</LINK>). Raynaud's phenomenon may be associated with other vasospastic disorders such as Prinzmetal's (variant) angina or migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Suggested criteria for diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon include vasospastic attacks precipitated by cold or emotional stress, symmetric attacks involving both hands, absence of tissue necrosis, ulceration or gangrene, no history or physical findings suggesting secondary cause, normal nailfold capillaries, normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and negative serologic findings, particularly anti-nuclear antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Prodigy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wigley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigley 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>A study in England found a prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon of 11% to 16% in men and 19% to 21% in women (<LINK REF="REF-Silman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silman 1990</LINK>). Studies in warmer climates have found a prevalence of 3% to 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Wigley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigley 2002</LINK>). Most people with Raynaud's have developed symptoms before the age of 40 (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2006</LINK>). In the subset with more severe symptoms seen in a specialist setting, 80% to 90% have primary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschl 2006</LINK>). The transition rate from primary to secondary Raynaud's phenomenon can be up to 1% to 2% per year for people monitored in a specialist setting, but the symptoms may also disappear (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer_x002d_Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer-Green 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>For most people primary Raynaud's phenomenon is a well known condition. It is at most a nuisance and is rarely mentioned even to the general practitioner (<LINK REF="REF-Silman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silman 1990</LINK>). Attacks usually last for a few minutes, but may last for hours. Rarely, superficial ulcers develop in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, especially associated with autoimmune diseases, may develop trophic changes (abnormalities of the skin or subcutaneous tissues), painful ulcers and gangrene (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). The symptomatic treatment of the two groups is the same. However, the progressive tissue damage seen in scleroderma-associated Raynaud's phenomenon may be the reason why many treatments are less effective in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). Most patients can control their symptoms by conservative measures such as avoiding exposure to cold and using protective clothing. Smoking and other factors that may cause symptoms, including drugs and the use of vibratory tools, should be avoided. However, some people are more severely affected, with higher frequency and duration of attacks, often with seasonal variations. If symptoms do not respond adequately to conservative measures, nifedipine or an alternative calcium channel blocker is recommended as first-line treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prodigy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy 2006</LINK>). Treatment with calcium channel blockers will be addressed in another Cochrane systematic review, and is not discussed in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Herrick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrick 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Calcium channel blockers may give unwanted side effects, and a range of other drugs have been suggested as alternatives because of their vasodilator action (widening of the blood vessels) and the experience with their use for other cardiovascular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pope-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prodigy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wigley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigley 2002</LINK>). However, these reviews report limited evidence of the effects of these drugs on primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Among the various drugs, only a few are licensed for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-BNF53" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF53</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medicines.org.uk" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medicines.org.uk</LINK>). Others are licensed for peripheral vascular diseases. For a detailed list of drugs with vasodilator effects <I>see</I> additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Antithrombotic treatments have been used for severe disease, especially secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). Intravenous treatment with prostacyclin analogues or cervical or digital sympathectomy are alternatives for patients with severe ischaemia of the fingers unresponsive to any other medical treatment. Digital or phalangeal amputations may be the final outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Wigley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigley 2002</LINK>). These complications are very rare in primary Raynaud's phenomenon.</P>
<P>Vascular tone is normally regulated by a complex interaction between smooth muscle, endothelium and innervation of the vessels. The primary defect in Raynaud's phenomenon is probably related to abnormal autoregulation of the small blood vessels (microvasculature). This might involve a combination of excessive release of vasoconstrictive mediators, exaggerated vasoconstrictive responses and blunted vasodilatory responses (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). However, the underlying process is still poorly understood (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2006</LINK>). Vasoconstriction in peripheral vessels is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system via alpha-adrenergic receptors of the vascular smooth muscle, predominantly the alpha 2 receptors, leading to a theory of effect of alpha blockers. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists inhibit the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin-II on vascular smooth muscle. A platelet release of serotonin contributing to the vasospasm has been observed in scleroderma-related Raynaud's phenomenon, leading to the theory of effect of serotonergic S2-receptor antagonists (ketanserin) and serotonin converting enzyme inhibitors (SSRI) (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medicines.org.uk" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medicines.org.uk</LINK>). For most other drugs, their vasodilatory effect is known, but not how this may influence the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. </P>
<P>Few drugs are licensed for the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Many studies on the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon have restricted participants to persons with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Because of the different underlying aetiology and pathophysiology of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, it is probable that the treatment effect will be different in the two groups. Many of the possible alternative drugs also have adverse effects, and this may restrict their possible long-term use by otherwise healthy and often young people.</P>

<P>Trials with oral administration of any drugs with vasodilator effects compared with placebo or other drugs were identified. This included drugs registered for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, Chapter 2 in the British National Formulary (BNF) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF53" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF53</LINK>) and Class C in the Anatomical Therapeutical Classification (ATC) system (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-classification" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC classification</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BNF53" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF53</LINK>). Other drugs with vasodilator effects that have been suggested for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon, but that are primarily used for non-cardiovascular diseases, were also included.

Full-text articles were obtained and, if necessary, translated if the above mentioned inclusion criteria were met, or if the titles or abstracts did not clarify inclusion or exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.</P>
<P>One member of the review team (MS or BV) contacted 25 trial authors or co-authors for additional information on the articles which did not provide sufficient information to determine whether they should be included or excluded. This included all articles where data from subgroups could not be identified. Postal and e-mail addresses were obtained by searching the relevant article, the author's or co-authors' most recent reference in Web of Science and 'Google'. Replies were received from nine. One author was able to provide additional information but the other authors could not provide additional information because of lost or otherwise unavailable data. One pharmaceutical company was contacted for additional information.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Each study was reviewed by two members of the review team (MS and either BV or JM) independently, and the data from the included studies were extracted using the Cochrane PVD Group 'Data Extraction Table'. This included method of allocation, degree of blinding, power calculations, exclusions post-randomisation, losses to follow up, source of funding, country where the study was undertaken, number of participants, age and sex of participants, inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment, control group, duration of study, and outcome measures. One study had multiple publications. In this case, we extracted the data from the most complete reported study (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>). We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two members of the review team (MS and BV) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>.</P>
<P>The Jadad method assigns scores to each study based on the three questions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Was the study described as randomised?</LI>
<LI>Was the study described as double blind?</LI>
<LI>Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts?</LI>
</OL>
<P>A score of one point was given if the answer to the question was 'yes' and zero if the answer was 'no'. An additional one point was given to questions one and two if the method was described and was appropriate. One point was deducted if the method was described and was inappropriate.</P>
<P>The Schulz study found that trials which reported treatment allocation concealment inadequately or unclearly yielded larger estimates of treatment effects than when they were adequately reported. A score of A was given when treatment allocation was adequately concealed and clearly stated. A score of B was given if allocation was unclear; this included allocation stated as random but no further details were given. A score of C was given if treatment allocation was definitely inadequate. D indicated that the score was not assigned.</P>
<P>In addition, we undertook a general assessment of each study. This included power calculations, the use of adequate statistical methods, intention-to-treat analysis, and a description of characteristics of intervention and treatment groups. This was used to assess the quality of the studies. However, no cut-off points were defined and subsequently used as criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies. Disagreement between the authors was resolved by consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>We performed statistical analysis according to the statistical guidelines provided for authors by the Cochrane PVD Group and from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 4.2.6 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Statistical analyses were carried out using the Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. Paired t-tests were carried out according to the methods described in Campbell and Machin (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all the studies, results were presented as mean values for whole treatment periods, and these were used as post-intervention values. Analyses were carried out using the difference between the treatment and control group's post-intervention values. No changes from baseline values were included in the analyses. Rates for frequency of attacks were recalculated to attacks per week to allow for easier comparison between the trials. Conversion between standard errors (SE) and standard deviations (SD) was carried out when necessary.</P>
<P>Two trials measured outcomes on more than one occasion. <LINK REF="STD-Le-Quentrec-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Le Quentrec 1991</LINK> measured outcomes at two, four and six months, using the same dose during the whole treatment period. The differences in outcome between four and six months were minor. We used the six-month outcomes in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK> measured outcomes after Phase II, 20 &#956;g<B> </B>three times daily, and Phase III, 40 &#956;g three times daily. We used the latter outcomes in this review. Additional information for the <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK> study clarified that intention-to-treat analyses had been carried out. For all other trials with exclusions, withdrawals or losses to follow up, no intention-to-treat analysis had been discussed or presented. In these, the calculations of the results for the cross-over trials had been based on the participants who completed both treatment arms. No data were re-analysed according to the principles of intention-to-treat.</P>
<P>Many trials reported outcomes using different scales, especially for severity. Because of the limited results, the data could not be pooled and it was not necessary to convert data to standardised mean differences.</P>
<P>Because of the limited results, numbers needed to treat (NNT) or subgroup analyses were not carried out. A funnel plot to assess the possibility of publication bias could not be constructed because of the lack of comparable studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Parallel design trials</HEADING>
<P>Two trials had a parallel design. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risk (RR) as a summary statistic with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we extracted mean and standard deviation values for each treatment period and analysed using the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI intervals as summary statistic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cross-over design trials</HEADING>
<P>Six trials had a cross-over design. Where possible, we analysed the effect measures for continuous data as mean differences (95% CI) using the results from paired analyses. The results were available directly from the trial reports (<LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>), by calculations from individual data using the paired t-test (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>) or by calculating standard errors (SE) from the reported confidence interval (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>, outcome frequency of attacks). We entered the results into RevMan using the generic inverse variance method.</P>
<P>Two studies presented the results as means ± SE for each treatment group separately (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>, outcome improvement; <LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>). No data were presented which allowed conversion to standard deviations (SD) of paired observations. We analysed the data using weighted mean differences (WMD) (95% CI) as a summary statistic as though a parallel design had been used. According to <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>, treating data from cross-over trials as parallel group trials ignores the fact that the same patients appear in both arms of the study. This may lead to a unit of analysis error, and the resulting confidence intervals may be too wide.</P>
<P>Three cross-over trials presented results as dichotomous data. Paired analyses could not be carried out because of the lack of reported data. Correlation coefficients could not be calculated because there were only single trials for each drug. For two trials the results are reported with no further analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>). For one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>) the results from the trial author's own paired analysis is presented (outcome fewer attacks). We analysed the results for adverse events for this study using relative risk (95% CI) as a summary statistic, as no data for paired analysis were presented (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>No analyses for cross-over trials were carried out using results from only the first treatment period. Of the six cross-over trials, only one included a wash-out period (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>). Calculations for carry-over or period effect were not carried out.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>The results of three cross-over studies were combined in a meta-analysis. These compared the ACE inhibitors captopril (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>) and enalapril (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>) with placebo for the outcome 'frequency of attacks'. We entered the data into RevMan using the generic inverse variance method. A random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) was used because captopril and enalapril belong to the same class of drugs, but have different pharmacological properties, and the duration of the treatment periods were unequal. The <LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK> study was given a high weight compared to the other studies because of a small standard error. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the enalapril trial from the meta-analysis. Because of the similarity between the two captopril trials concerning participants, dose, length of treatment and lack of wash-out period, we used a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>Results for the other drugs are presented separately because of the lack of pharmacological similarity, and no other assessment of heterogeneity was relevant.</P>

<P>See the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table.</P>
<P>A total of eight studies were included with a total of 290 participants. The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK>) involved 125 participants. One study had six participants, and the remaining had less than 41 participants. The studies were published between 1980 and 1996.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>One trial had a mixture of participants with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>). One had a mixture of participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and chilblains (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>). However, this trial was conducted and the results were presented completely separately for the two groups. The remaining trials included only participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. All studies defined primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon according to criteria, but the degree of detail varied substantially. The baseline frequency of attacks was six to 24 per week in all trials except one. This trial reported a mean of 91 attacks per week (<LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>). This high frequency was also discussed by the trial author, and was therefore not likely to be due to an error in reporting the data. Ten of 41 participants in this trial had previously undergone thoracic sympathectomy, reflecting severe disease.</P>
<P>One study had only female participants; the others had more female than male participants, reflecting the prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in the population. The age range was identical in all studies, having both young (around 20 years of age) and older (around 70 years of age) participants. The setting was general practice in one, specialist outpatient clinic in four and not described in three trials. All trials were conducted in the winter season. The prevalence of smoking was reported by some authors, and varied between 14% and 51%. The studies differed in the details and description of their exclusion criteria.</P>

<P>The studies represented seven different drugs. There were two trials with captopril and single trials on each of the following drugs: beraprost, buflomedil, enalapril, dazoxiben, ketanserin and moxisylyte (thymoxamine). Seven trials compared a drug with placebo. One study was a cross-over trial comparing dazoxiben with a calcium channel blocker and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>). The calcium channel blocker data were not used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of studies</HEADING>
<P>The duration of the treatment periods varied from two weeks to six months. Two studies had a two-week run-in period, one study had a four-week run-in period, all with single-blind placebo treatment. One study had a two-week run-in with no treatment. Four studies had no run-in period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Frequency, duration and severity were recorded in diaries. Frequency of attacks was reported in all studies. Most studies also had some measure of severity.

<P>Of the 77 studies in the exclusion list, 28 did not present data which allowed data extraction and subgroup analyses for participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Ten were not randomised controlled trials; most were open studies or with no control group. In 11 trials the participants did not meet the inclusion criteria, mainly because all participants had secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. In six trials the drug was administered only once (single dose trials), and in 16 the treatments were not oral; these were topical applications, intradermal injections and intravenous treatments. In seven trials the outcomes were not relevant for this review, mostly because subjective outcomes were not included. Some lacked any description or definition of the outcome and how the data were collected. In three studies the results were presented unclearly and could not be used. No additional information could be obtained. Of the excluded studies, at least 45 had less than 20 participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and many of these less than 10 participants. We excluded six trials because a comparison with a calcium channel blocker was made. Many studies had more than one reason for exclusion.</P>
<P>Although the trial authors' definition of primary Raynaud's phenomenon was accepted irrespective of details in definition of criteria, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cleophas-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cleophas 1984</LINK>) was excluded because it specified that eight of 20 participants in the primary Raynaud's phenomenon group had positive anti nuclear antibodies (ANA). This is an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon.</P>
<P>The following classes of drugs or single drugs were not represented in the included studies: Alpha adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nitrates, inositol nicotinate, naftidrofuryl oxalate, cilostazol, SSRI's and antihistamines (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<P>All included studies were described as randomised and double blinded. Two trials had an allocation score A and a Jadad score of five.

For these six studies the description of the methods for allocation, randomisation and blinding was lacking or inadequate. We could not assess the quality of the methods.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow up and exclusions</HEADING>
<P>No study specifically discussed intention-to-treat analysis. However, additional information confirming this was supplied by one author (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK>). This study had 14% loss to follow up after randomisation. Six studies had none or one to two exclusions.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK> study was a cross-over study which randomised 41 participants. However, only 33 completed the study and were included in the results for frequency of attacks. Loss to follow up was 20%. For severity and duration of attacks, data from only 25 versus 26 participants could be used. This was explained by low precision in the reporting and may have been caused by poorly defined outcomes. Loss to follow up for these outcomes was 37 to 39%.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Power calculations</HEADING>
<P>Only one study presented sample size calculations (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK>). The study included fewer participants than the numbers estimated (118 after randomisation versus 160). Only 102 participants completed the study. The treatment effect turned out to be very small compared with the estimated 50% difference in the number of attacks between the two treatment groups on which the sample size calculations were based. The study was therefore underpowered. Generally, the sample sizes in the studies were small.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cross-over studies, carry-over and period effect</HEADING>
<P>Five cross-over studies did not include a wash-out period (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK> included a one-week wash-out period, and placebo as one of the three treatment arms. The drugs had different pharmacological properties. It is probable that a carry-over effect, i.e. effect of the active treatment continuing into the next placebo period, may have affected the final results in some studies. Some authors reported testing for period and carry-over effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reporting of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A variety of scales were used for severity. This included 0 to 4 scale, 1 to 3 scale, 100 mm or 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale, and severity score = frequency times duration. Scales were generally described. However, in some trials there was a lack of definition (<LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>), or inconsistency (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>) between the scale described in methods section and the reported results. Therefore, these outcomes were excluded from the review. Two studies did not report results for outcomes described in the methods section (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>). Some data were reported as binary data or short ordinal scales, as variations of improved-unchanged-worse. The validation and definitions used for these were not described or discussed in the studies.</P>

</B>Three studies comparing captopril 25 mg three times daily (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>) or enalapril 20 mg once daily (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>) with placebo were included. All were cross-over studies. All 45 participants had primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The duration of both captopril trials was two periods of six weeks and the enalapril trial was two periods of four weeks.</P>
<P>For the meta-analysis of the ACE inhibitors captopril and enalapril there was a statistically significant difference in the mean number of attacks per week, with higher frequency on treatment (0.79 attacks; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.16). After the <LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK> study was excluded from the analysis, the difference between captopril and placebo was non-significant (difference in means 0.64, 95% CI -1.11 to 2.38).</P>
<P>Enalapril alone was associated with a small increase in the frequency of attacks per week. The difference in the mean number of attacks per week was 0.80 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.17), favouring placebo. There was a non-significant difference on the subjective assessment of improvement, favouring placebo (10 cm Visual Analogue Scale) (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.10; 95% CI -0.01 to 2.21). Thirteen of 20 participants experienced more attacks on enalapril than on placebo.</P>
<P>One study reported duration per attack. There was a non-significant difference favouring captopril (-0.54 minutes; 95% CI -2.42 to 1.34) (<LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK> study reported three of 10 improved in the captopril group and two of 10 improved in placebo group. The remaining participants in each group were unchanged.</P>
<P>There were no withdrawals in the captopril studies and one in the enalapril study. This withdrawal was for personal reasons and was deemed unrelated to the treatment by the authors. There were no reported side effects in the <LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK> trial. <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK> reported one participant with nausea the first week and one with pain in the calf muscle during the whole intervention period in the captopril group, and no side effects in the placebo group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK> trial nine participants receiving enalapril and eight participants receiving placebo reported side effects.

All 31 participants had primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The duration of the trial was six months, with outcomes measured at two, four and six months. We used the results from the six months follow up in this review.</P>
<P>The difference in the frequency of attacks per week favoured buflomedil, however, the confidence interval was wide and close to non-significant. (WMD -8.82; 95% CI -17.55 to -0.09). Baseline frequency was 24 attacks per week in both intervention groups.</P>
<P>The difference in the mean severity score favoured buflomedil, but this was not statistically significant (WMD -0.41; 95% CI -0.84 to 0.02).</P>
<P>There were no withdrawals from the trial. Two side effects were reported in the placebo group (gastric upset) and three in the buflomedil group (gastric burning, vertigo, hot flush). The side effects disappeared spontaneously with neither modification nor withdrawal of treatment.</P>

This was a parallel design trial comparing beraprost 40 &#956;g three times daily with placebo (phase III). All 125 participants had primary Raynaud's phenomenon. We used the results from Phase III of the trial.</P>
<P>Although both treatment groups had a reduction of attacks per week, this was higher in the placebo group. The difference was non-significant (WMD 2.0; 95% CI -0.20 to 4.20). Baseline values were 11 to 12 attacks per week. Vayssairat found that the reduction of attacks from baseline was 44% in the placebo group and 37% in the beraprost group.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of effect on the severity of attacks, measured by the severity score (WMD -0.06; 95% CI -0.32 to 0.20) or the disability score (WMD 3.0; 95% CI -6.75 to 12.75). No differences were statistically significant.</P>
<P>A total of nine participants in the beraprost group and seven in the placebo group withdrew, four participants in the beraprost group and three in the placebo group because of side effects. Six were lost to follow up, and three withdrew because of personal reasons. These were equally distributed between the intervention groups. There were significantly more side effects in the beraprost group (relative risk (RR) 1.62; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.43).

<P>There was no evidence of the effect of ketanserin on the frequency or duration of attacks. The difference in number of attacks per week was 14, favouring ketanserin (WMD -14.0; 95% CI -33.40 to 5.40). The difference in the duration of attacks was four minutes per day, favouring ketanserin (WMD -4.0; 95% CI -19.30 to 11.30). These differences were not statistically significant. However, there was a significant difference between the two groups in the severity score, favouring ketanserin (WMD -133.0; 95% CI -202.27 to -63.73). Subjective feeling of improvement was reported by 24 participants after ketanserin treatment and 14 after placebo.</P>
<P>Twenty participants in the ketanserin group and 13 in the placebo group reported adverse events. The difference was non-significant (RR 1.54; 95% CI 0.89 to 2.65). Dizziness, headache and dry mouth were reported more frequently in the treatment group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-05-25 11:33:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>This review has summarised the evidence for the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon with drugs with vasodilator effects other than calcium channel blockers. Of 85 identified trials and more than 30 different drugs, eight studies were included, with a total of 290 participants. The studies represented seven different drugs, all compared with placebo. The drugs were: captopril, enalapril, buflomedil, beraprost, dazoxiben, ketanserin and moxisylyte (thymoxamine).</P>
<UL>
<LI>The meta-analysis of the ACE inhibitors captopril and enalapril, and enalapril alone, showed these drugs to be associated with a small increase in the frequency of attacks per week compared with placebo. For captopril alone, the difference between the treatment groups for frequency and duration of attacks was non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rustin 1987</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The difference between buflomedil and placebo on the frequency of attacks per week was significant, favouring buflomedil. However, the small sample size resulted in a wide confidence interval and low precision. The difference in the severity score was non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-Le-Quentrec-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Le Quentrec 1991</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was no evidence of the effect of beraprost compared with placebo on the frequency and severity of attacks and the disability score. All results were non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was no evidence of the effect of dazoxiben compared with placebo on the frequency of attacks. The difference was non-significant, and the precision of the results was low, with a wide confidence interval (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was no evidence of the effect of ketanserin on the frequency or duration of attacks, although the result for the severity score significantly favoured ketanserin. For all outcomes, the precision of the results was low because of very wide confidence intervals (<LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was a statistically significant effect in favour of moxisylyte compared with placebo on the number of participants experiencing fewer attacks (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Seven studies reported adverse events. Beraprost<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK>) and moxisylyte<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>) gave significantly more side effects than placebo. For the other drugs there were few reported adverse events, or the differences were non-significant.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The following classes of drugs or single drugs with vasodilator effects were not represented in the included studies: Alpha adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nitrates, inositol nicotinate, naftidrofuryl, cilostazol, SSRI's and antihistamines.</LI>
</UL>
<P>None of the studies discussed 'clinically important effect' as opposed to 'statistically significant effect'. A review on calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon arbitrarily defined a 30% reduction of symptoms as clinically important (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>). Some researchers on pain have defined clinically important results as a 50%, or alternatively 30%, reduction on a validated scale (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>). When this is added to a high placebo response, reported by <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK> to be close to 50% in some studies, the overall effect must be very high to obtain a clinically significant result. When subjective outcomes in the included studies were reported as dichotomous data, for example 'improved versus unchanged or worse' or 'fewer versus unchanged or more attacks', without described or validated scales, the clinical importance of the results was impossible to assess. This applied to moxisylyte (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1980</LINK>) and captopril (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>). For the studies that reported severity outcome, none used the same scale. The description and assessments of validity of the scales used was lacking or inadequate in all studies. This made evaluation of 'clinically significant results' impossible in the studies with statistically significant results. No drug had statistically significant differences between the intervention groups on all reported outcomes, and this reduced the clinical significance of single results.</P>
<P>Small sample sizes resulted in low statistical precision and wide confidence intervals. Only one study reported sample size calculations (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1996</LINK>). This was based on an estimated treatment effect which was very high compared to the actual result obtained, and the study was underpowered. The other studies had very small sample sizes. Single studies on each drug did not allow pooling of results for larger sample sizes and higher precision.</P>
<P>The advantage of a cross-over design is that the interventions are evaluated on the same participants, and the resulting within-subject differences are usually smaller than the within-group differences. Significant results can be obtained with smaller sample sizes than studies with parallel design. However, as the results in some trials were inadequately reported, in order to be used in this review the data had to be presented as though the studies were designed as parallel trials, with the subsequent loss of power (<LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-de-Wal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van de Wal 1987</LINK>). The advantages of the cross-over design were therefore lost (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Lack of wash-out periods with subsequent carry over may also have reduced the differences between treatment and placebo in the cross-over trials.</P>
<P>In all the included studies, the results were reported as mean values for whole treatment periods. Depending on the drug's pharmacological properties, especially when steady state takes longer to reach and the onset of effect is slow, any differences between the two intervention groups may be reduced when this method is used.</P>
<P>Although all participants were diagnosed with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, there may have been high degrees of heterogeneity within the studies. Any effects in subgroups would have been masked by a summary statistic, especially mean values. The small sample sizes and the few studies included did not allow subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>All these issues will, in different ways, have affected the final results in the studies. The probability of finding significant statistical and clinical effects has been reduced.</P>
<P>The defined outcomes for this review were only subjective outcomes. This is because primary Raynaud's phenomenon rarely leads to permanent tissue damage. Treatment is prophylactic and symptomatic and aimed directly at reducing the patient's symptoms. Objective measurements may be surrogate measures, and how the results relate to the patient's subjective symptoms may not be clear. Different methods have been developed over the years according to technical advances, which would make comparison of results from older and more recent studies difficult or impossible.</P>
<P>All the studies reported adverse events, but the clinical significance of these was difficult to assess because of the short trial durations and the many reported adverse events in the placebo groups. No study included follow up after discontinuation of treatment to specifically address the side effects of the discontinuation, although cross-over studies indirectly would register them because they would appear as placebo side effects for the comparison group which had placebo in the second period.</P>
<P>The intervention in this review was defined very broadly. This was based on an expected limited result, as reported by other reviews. Although very many drugs were included in the search strategy, it is possible that some trials may have been missed because the drugs were reported under other proprietary names, or were not described as 'vasodilator' in the title or text. There may be disagreements as to which drugs should be defined as 'vasodilator'. However, the general search term 'vasodilator agent' was meant to cover any drug that has not been specifically listed. The final number of included studies and the drugs they represented was very limited. It may be argued that they were selected by chance, because they happened to comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review, and not because they were the best in their group. However, a major part of the relevant randomised controlled trials did not present data for subgroup analysis. The result might have been different if it was possible to include the raw data for these studies. All the authors who replied to our enquiry stated that the raw data were either lost or destroyed. This may have been the case for most of the other studies, which were more than 15 to 20 years old. The pharmaceutical companies could give no additional information that could change the result. Many of the pharmaceutical companies which supported the included studies have ceased to exist or have merged with larger companies, thus making it difficult to find old data. It is probable that the included studies are representative for the methodological quality of trials in the 1980's, which means that the results in most other studies would not have been accepted without many reservations. The external validity, and subsequently the value of these studies will be reduced when compared to research based on current diagnostic procedures and demand for documentation according to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important result of this review is the identification of the many drugs which have been the object of trials, and the lack of evidence for their use for the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The poor quality of the few included studies reduced the value of any significant results.</P>
<P>The results of this review confirm the results in other reviews: there is no, or very limited evidence for treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon with drugs with vasodilator effects (<LINK REF="REF-Distler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Distler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pope-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prodigy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The overall result of this review is that there is no evidence of the effect of any drugs with vasodilator effects (excluding calcium channel blockers which were not considered in this review) on primary Raynaud's phenomenon. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Based on the results of this review, research is required on the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and more knowledge about alternatives to calcium channel blockers is essential. This includes safety and efficacy for long-term use, including adverse effects and the cost of treatment alternatives. </P>
<P>It is important that studies are adequately powered, taking account of the methodological challenges of high placebo responses and the natural fluctuations of symptoms. Methods must be developed that do not mask or reduce any possible effects of the different interventions. Standardisation of outcome measures and the use of validated scales is essential for the comparability between studies. An example of this is the 'Raynaud Condition Score', although this has been developed and validated for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 2002</LINK>). It is essential to agree on a definition of clinically important effects according to any validated scales that are used (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six of the eight included studies were supported by pharmaceutical companies, for the remaining two this was not described. Studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies have been shown to be more likely to have outcomes favouring the product of the sponsoring company than studies funded by other sources (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>). It is essential for future research that the source of support is explicitly stated, and that every effort is taken to develop standards for research funded by pharmaceutical companies or other agencies with commercial interests in the results (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reporting of trials using standards such as the recommendations of the CONSORT statement is likely to influence the quality of the conducted trials and facilitate the interpretation, evaluation, applicability and comparability of their results (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
