We used information from randomised trials comparing influenza vaccine with dummy vaccine or with nothing. The influenza vaccines were prepared by treating influenza viruses with a chemical that kills the virus (inactivated virus), and the vaccination was given by injection through the skin. We were interested in showing the effects of vaccines on reducing the number of elderly with confirmed influenza, the number who had influenza-like symptoms such as headache, high temperature, cough, and muscle pain (influenza-like illness, of ILI), and harms from vaccination. We looked for evidence of the impact of influenza or ILI such as hospital admission, complications, and death. We will update this review in the future only when new trials or vaccines become available.</P><P>Observational data from 67 studies included in previous versions of the review have been retained for historical reasons but have not been updated because of their lack of influence on the review conclusions.</P><P><B>What was studied in this review?</B></P><P>Over 200 viruses cause ILI, producing the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough, and runny nose). Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot distinguish between viruses, as they last for days and rarely lead to serious illness. At best, vaccines are only effective against influenza A and B, which represent about 5% of all circulating viruses. Inactivated vaccine is prepared by treating influenza viruses with a specific chemical agent that 'kills' the virus. Final preparations may contain either the complete viruses (whole-virion vaccine) or the active part of them (split or subunit vaccines). These vaccines are typically administered by injection through the skin. The virus strains contained in the vaccine are usually those that are expected to circulate in the following epidemic seasons (two type A and one or two B strains), which are recommended by the World Health Organization (seasonal vaccine). Pandemic vaccine contains only the virus strain that is responsible for the pandemic (e.g. the type A H1N1 for the 2009 to 2010 pandemic).</P><P><B>Key messages</B></P><P>Inactivated vaccines can reduce the proportion of elderly who have influenza and ILI. Data on deaths were sparse, and we found no data on hospitalisations due to complications. However, variation in the results of studies means we cannot be certain about how big a difference these vaccines will make across different seasons.</P><P><B>Main results</B></P><P>We found eight randomised controlled trials (over 5000 people), of which four assessed harms. The studies were conducted in community and residential care settings in Europe and the USA between 1965 and 2000.</P><P>Older adults receiving the influenza vaccine may experience less influenza over a single season, from 6% to 2.4%, meaning that 30 people would need to be vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccines to avoid one case of influenza. Older adults also probably experience less ILI, from 6% to 3.5%, meaning that 42 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of ILI. The amount of information on pneumonia and mortality was limited. Data were insufficient to be certain about the effect of vaccines on mortality. No cases of pneumonia occurred in one study that reported this outcome, and no data on hospitalisations were reported. We do not have enough information to assess harms relating to fever and nausea in this population.</P><P>The impact of influenza vaccines in older people is modest, irrespective of setting, outcome, population, and study design.<BR/><B><BR/>How up to date is this review?</B></P><P>The evidence is current to 31 December 2016.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-15 08:11:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-03 12:59:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The consequences of influenza in the elderly (those age 65 years or older) are complications, hospitalisations, and death. The primary goal of influenza vaccination in the elderly is to reduce the risk of death among people who are most vulnerable. This is an update of a review published in 2010.

We considered any influenza vaccine given independently, in any dose, preparation, or time schedule, compared with placebo or with no intervention. Previous versions of this review included 67 cohort and case-control studies. The searches for these trial designs are no longer updated.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-01-02 12:47:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE for the key outcomes of influenza, ILI, complications (hospitalisation, pneumonia), and adverse events. We have presented aggregate control group risks to illustrate the effect in absolute terms. We used them as the basis for calculating the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of each event for influenza and ILI outcomes.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-15 08:11:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>We identified eight RCTs (over 5000 participants), of which four assessed harms. The studies were conducted in community and residential care settings in Europe and the USA between 1965 and 2000. Risk of bias reduced our certainty in the findings for influenza and ILI, but not for other outcomes.</P><P>Older adults receiving the influenza vaccine may experience less influenza over a single season compared with placebo, from 6% to 2.4% (risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.66; low-certainty evidence). We rated the evidence as low certainty due to uncertainty over how influenza was diagnosed. Older adults probably experience less ILI compared with those who do not receive a vaccination over the course of a single influenza season (3.5% versus 6%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.73; moderate-certainty evidence). These results indicate that 30 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one person experiencing influenza, and 42 would need to be vaccinated to prevent one person having an ILI.</P><P>The study providing data for mortality and pneumonia was underpowered to detect differences in these outcomes. There were 3 deaths from 522 participants in the vaccination arm and 1 death from 177 participants in the placebo arm, providing very low-certainty evidence for the effect on mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.72). No cases of pneumonia occurred in one study that reported this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No data on hospitalisations were reported. Confidence intervaIs around the effect of vaccines on fever and nausea were wide, and we do not have enough information about these harms in older people (fever: 1.6% with placebo compared with 2.5% after vaccination (RR 1.57, 0.92 to 2.71; moderate-certainty evidence)); nausea (2.4% with placebo compared with 4.2% after vaccination (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.12; low-certainty evidence)).</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-12 10:34:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Older adults receiving the influenza vaccine may have a lower risk of influenza (from 6% to 2.4%), and probably have a lower risk of ILI compared with those who do not receive a vaccination over the course of a single influenza season (from 6% to 3.5%). We are uncertain how big a difference these vaccines will make across different seasons. Very few deaths occurred, and no data on hospitalisation were reported. No cases of pneumonia occurred in one study that reported this outcome. We do not have enough information to assess harms relating to fever and nausea in this population.</P><P>The evidence for a lower risk of influenza and ILI with vaccination is limited by biases in the design or conduct of the studies. Lack of detail regarding the methods used to confirm the diagnosis of influenza limits the applicability of this result. The available evidence relating to complications is of poor quality, insufficient, or old and provides no clear guidance for public health regarding the safety, efficacy, or effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older. Society should invest in research on a new generation of influenza vaccines for the elderly.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-30 14:22:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-30 14:22:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-10 13:27:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Viral respiratory disease imposes a heavy burden on society. The majority of viral respiratory disease (influenza-like illness (ILI)) is caused by many different agents that are not clinically distinguishable from one another. A variable proportion of ILI (7% to 15% on average) is caused by influenza viruses and is known as influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009a</LINK>).</P><P>Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the <I>Orthomyxoviridae</I> family. Three serotypes are known (A, B, and C). Influenza causes an acute febrile illness with muscle ache, headache, and cough. Although the median duration of the acute illness is three days, cough and malaise can persist for weeks. Complications of influenza include otitis media, pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease, and bronchiolitis in children. Additionally, influenza can cause a range of non-respiratory complications including febrile convulsions, Reye's syndrome, and myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Treanor-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treanor 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiselka-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiselka 1994</LINK>). Efforts to prevent or minimise the impact of seasonal influenza in the second part of the 20th century centred on the use of vaccines. Due to the yearly changes in viral antigenic configuration and the lack of carry-over protection from year to year, a new vaccination campaign needs to be organised annually, with a huge scientific and logistic effort to ensure production and delivery of the vaccines.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-12 10:36:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Currently there are three types of influenza vaccines:</P><OL><LI>whole-virion vaccines, which consist of complete viruses that have been 'killed' or inactivated, so that they are not infectious but retain their strain-specific antigenic properties;</LI><LI>subunit virion vaccines, which are made of surface antigens (H and N) only; and</LI><LI>split-virion vaccines, in which the viral structure is broken up by a disrupting agent.</LI></OL><P>These vaccines contain both surface and internal antigens. In addition, a variety of non-European manufacturers produce live attenuated vaccines. Traditionally, whole-virion vaccines are thought to be less well tolerated due to the presence of a lipid stratum on the surface of the viral particles (a remnant of the host cell membrane coating the virion, when budding from the host cell).</P><P>Influenza vaccines are produced worldwide. Periodic antigenic drifts and shifts pose problems for vaccine production and procurement, as a new vaccine closely matching the circulating antigenic configuration must be produced and procured for the beginning of each new influenza 'season'. To achieve this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a worldwide surveillance system, allowing for the identification and isolation of viral strains circulating the different parts of the globe. Sentinel practices (designated primary care points) recover viral particles from the nasopharynx of people with influenza-like symptoms, and the samples are swiftly sent to the laboratories of the national influenza centres (110 laboratories in 79 countries). When new strains are detected, the samples are sent to one of the four WHO reference centres (London, Atlanta, Tokyo, and Melbourne) for antigenic analysis. Information on the circulating strain is then sent to the WHO, which in February of each year recommends, through a committee, the strains to be included in the vaccine for the forthcoming 'season'. Individual governments may or may not follow the WHO recommendations. Surveillance and early identification thus play a central part in the composition of the vaccine.</P><P>The global influenza spread and burden can be assessed by consulting the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) web page, which provides an overview and country comparison options (www.who.int/influenza/resources/charts/en/).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-02 13:54:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Vaccines work by simulating an infection and stimulating the body to produce antibodies against the threat and activate other defence mechanisms.</P><P>Vaccines have been the main global weapon to minimise the impact of influenza in the elderly for the last four decades, as people aged 65 and older are at higher risk of complications, hospitalisations, and death from influenza. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the primary goal of influenza vaccination in the elderly is to reduce the risk of complications among people who are most vulnerable (<LINK REF="REF-ACIP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACIP 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2004</LINK>). Vaccines containing yearly WHO recommended influenza strains are used worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Grohskopf-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grohskopf 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treanor-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treanor 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016</LINK>).</P><P>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently made changes to the registration of seasonal, pre-pandemic, and pandemic influenza vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijnans-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijnans 2016</LINK>). Changes were introduced in 2014, triggered by the realisation that antibody responses are not sufficient predictors of field protection, as our reviews have consistently shown over the years. Most of the data for influenza vaccines included in our reviews are from registered vaccines, and yet the field protection afforded is modest or negligible. In addition, the methods of standardisation of antibody titres were lacking. The new rules for adults and elderly require demonstration of non-inferiority of antibody response (immunogenicity) by a candidate seasonal influenza vaccine compared to an established one. In addition, whenever a demonstration of clinical efficacy is necessary, EMA encourages minimal use of placebo and encourages the use of active controls (such as non-influenza vaccines) with ILI (and relevant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results) as a primary endpoint. Clinical effectiveness should be tested by carrying out (preferably prospective) cohort studies or nested so-called test negative case-control studies following the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocol (<LINK REF="REF-ECDC-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDC 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ECDC-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDC 2009b</LINK>).</P><P>Harms surveillance is now required with a follow-up of at least 6 months&#8217; duration and in the general elderly population a database of at least 3000 people exposed to the vaccine. Enhanced vaccine vigilance data should be collected as soon as possible at the beginning of the vaccination campaign each year.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-30 14:22:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Due to the unique production cycle of influenza vaccines (they are tested using surrogate outcomes - antibody stimulation - ahead of each influenza 'season'), past performance is probably the only reliable way to predict future performance.</P><P>An accurate assessment of the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and safety profile) of influenza vaccines is essential to allow for rational choice between alternative strategies. This review, with its two companion reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Demicheli-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demicheli 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2012</LINK>), are long-running reviews. They are among the most consistently accessed in the whole <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I>, confirming the importance of the topic and interest in it. Periodic updates, some stretching back almost two decades, have allowed us to include an increasing number of studies on the effects of influenza vaccines and monitor their impact on our reviews (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P><P>The reviews are not methodologically homogeneous, as their methods reflect the history and development of Cochrane Reviews. In particular, the inclusion of observational studies, which was initially favoured for the assessment of harms, has been a source of discussion. In the elderly, randomised evidence represents 11% of included studies because no eligible trials have been completed in the past three decades, while numerous observational studies are completed each year.</P><P>Historically, observational studies have been of poor methodological quality, often reporting conflicting or paradoxical results, preventing the drawing of firm conclusions. However, inclusion of particular study types and increasing size of the data sets has not led to a change in the conclusion of the reviews, while leading to a greatly increased workload. This is the main reason why the authors, the review group, and the Cochrane editors have decided to stabilise all three reviews, that is to not carry out routine updates of the observational data set and to update the randomised data set if certain conditions are fulfilled in the future.</P><P>For the same reason, the observational content of this review and its companions have been retained as historical evidence of the life cycle of the reviews.</P><P>We plan to update the randomised evidence in this review if any or all of the following conditions are fulfilled in the future:</P><UL><LI>a trial assessing the clinical effects of the evolution of current technologies becomes available;</LI><LI>a new type of vaccine is developed; or</LI><LI>a new credible causal paradigm for influenza is put forward.</LI></UL><P>For an overview of the three reviews, see the covering editorial at <A HREF="https://community.cochrane.org/news/why-have-three-long-running-cochrane-reviews-influenza-vaccines-been-stabilised">https://community.cochrane.org/news/why-have-three-long-running-cochrane-reviews-influenza-vaccines-been-stabilised</A>.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-03 12:57:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and harm) of vaccines against influenza in the elderly.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 10:44:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-25 10:44:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-01-03 12:58:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs.

The certainty of the evidence was low for influenza and moderate for ILI. Our estimates were consistently below those usually quoted for economic modelling or decision making. In view of the known variability of incidence and effect of influenza, we constructed a large number of comparisons and strata to minimise possible heterogeneity between studies and to aid comparability. We also performed subanalysis of studies describing better defined epidemic periods. Despite our attempts, we noted significant residual heterogeneity among studies that could be explained only in part by different study designs, methodological quality, settings, viral circulation, vaccine types and matching, age, population types, and risk factors. We think the residual heterogeneity could be the result of the unpredictable nature of the spread of influenza and ILI and the bias caused by the non-randomised nature of our evidence base. Our sensitivity analysis did not affect the final result.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-04 15:40:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Whatever the causes of observed variability, we believe that the decision to vaccinate against influenza cannot be made based on the results of single studies, or reporting observations from a few seasons; rather, it should be taken on the basis of all available evidence. The conclusions drawn from studies done in individuals living in long-term care facilities differ from those drawn from studies in individuals living in the community. Studies done in residents of care homes often indicate the inevitably improvised nature of efforts to study the effect of vaccination during an epidemic. The resident population is usually more homogeneous than that in the community: older, with similar viral exposure and risk levels. Despite remaining heterogeneity and an overestimation of the effects as a result of study design, it is possible to detect a gradient of effectiveness, in which vaccines have little effect on cases of ILI. This finding suggests that control of influenza through vaccination is a possibility. However, the effectiveness of vaccines in the community is modest, irrespective of adjustment for systematic differences between vaccine recipients and non-recipients. The difficulties of achieving good coverage in those who need it most or the diluting effect on vaccines for influenza of other agents circulating in the community (causing ILI, clinically indistinguishable from influenza) might be to blame. We noted empirical proof of both these possibilities, with differential vaccine uptake among the same population (linked to age, sex, and health status) and a low effect on ILI throughout our data sets, even in periods of supposedly high influenza viral circulation, when the proportion of cases of ILI caused by influenza are highest and the possible benefits of vaccination should be greatest.</P><P>The impact of vaccines on pneumonia, mortality, and hospitalisations from the randomised evidence available is insufficient to draw conclusions. Very few studies have captured data on these outcomes, and where we have obtained data, the rate of events was too low to be able to determine the size of effect (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P><P>Safety does not appear to be a particular problem: the public health safety profile of the vaccines is acceptable. However, relatively few studies assessed safety outcomes.<BR/></P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-25 10:44:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>We rated the quality of evidence to be moderate for ILI and fever, low for influenza and nausea, and very low for hospitalisations and death (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Most of the available evidence for these outcomes is from studies with unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. Fever was the only outcome where we did not consider bias to be influential due to consistency in direction and size of effect with the low risk of bias study (<LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994a</LINK>). The lack of detail regarding the diagnosis of influenza limits the applicability of our findings to laboratory-confirmed influenza and is a source of indirectness.</P><P>For other outcomes (e.g. nausea and fever), the method of ascertainment is less uncertain due to the expected mechanism of action of vaccines.</P><P>Imprecision arising from wide CIs or low event rates, or both, affects the evidence for adverse events, death, and pneumonia to varying degrees. The CIs for fever and nausea were wide (serious imprecision), but death and pneumonia were rare events in the studies, prompting us to downgrade two levels for very serious imprecision. The rating of very low quality for the latter two outcomes reflects the sparse nature of the data available for analysis.</P><P>The main problem with interpreting our substantial data set is caused by the relative scarcity of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Only one trial assessed currently available vaccines and reached satisfactory completion (<LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994a</LINK>). The remainder of the data set consists of evidence from non-RCTs.</P><P>Our main concern was the quality of the non-RCTs, which likely affected the estimates of effect reported in our review. The findings of the included cohort studies are likely to have been affected to varying degrees by selection bias. Differential uptake of influenza vaccines is linked to several factors (anxiety over unwanted effects, disease threat perception, societal and economic conditions, education, health status) and hence to outcome. Confounding by indication (people with chronic illness or people who are perceived to be frailer than others are more likely to be vaccinated) might reduce the estimated vaccine efficacy. People with terminal illness or with socio-economic disadvantages are less likely to be vaccinated, and this fact might enhance vaccine efficacy. Both these interpretations are based on empirical evidence. For example, one cohort study had difficulty achieving high coverage in those most at need (<LINK REF="STD-Gen_x00e9_-Badia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gené Badia 1991</LINK>). Differential vaccine uptake and the resulting selection bias is the most likely explanation for the high effectiveness of influenza vaccines in preventing deaths from all causes. A good example of the potential effect of such confounders is the apparently counterintuitive effectiveness of the vaccines in elderly individuals living in the community. In this population, vaccine effectiveness shows an implausible sequence: the vaccines are apparently ineffective in the prevention of influenza, ILI, pneumonia, hospital admissions, or deaths from any respiratory disease, but are effective in the prevention of hospital admission for influenza and pneumonia and in the prevention of deaths from all causes.</P><P>Non-RCT evidence in this review is open to any alternative interpretation and consistently fails to give satisfactory answers. Since the publication of our 2006 review (<LINK REF="REF-Rivetti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivetti 2006</LINK>), several empirical studies looking at the effect of selection bias in retrospective cohorts (variously called selection bias, confounding by indication, or healthy user effect) have been published. Some confirmed the presence and effect of confounders (<LINK REF="REF-Eurich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eurich 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fukushima-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukushima 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glezen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glezen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirota-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirota 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006e</LINK>). Other studies, mainly carried out by the authors of cohort studies in question, failed to find any effect of confounding on mortality once adjustment had been carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Groenwold-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groenwold 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groenwold-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groenwold 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nichol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nichol 2007</LINK>). For example, proof of bias was provided by a study evaluating the risk of hospitalisation and death in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated seniors during influenza and non-influenza periods (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006a</LINK>). Consistent with other published studies, during influenza season, vaccination was associated with a 44% reduction in risk of all-cause mortality. However, in the period before the influenza season, vaccination was associated with a 61% reduction in risk of this outcome. The reduction in risk before the influenza season indicates the presence of bias due to preferential selection of vaccination by relatively healthy seniors, and the strength of that bias is sufficient to account entirely for the association found during the influenza season. In a second, nested case-control study, seniors with functional markers of frailty (such as dependence on washing) were found to be at a greatly increased risk of death and were less likely to have received influenza vaccine, indicating that these factors are important sources of bias in assessment of influenza vaccine effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006b</LINK>).</P><P>Regardless of the results of empirical studies, the sheer implausibility of the effectiveness sequence which ends with high estimates of effect against mortality from all causes points to considerable confounding and calls into question the reliability of using such non-specific outcomes. Systematic differences between the intervention and control arms of cohort studies are likely to be the result of a baseline imbalance in health status and other known and unknown systematic differences in the two groups of participants. The rationale of the work starts from the observation that the 47% reduction in risk of all-cause mortality in elderly community dwellers observed in our review exceeds by far the estimated possible impact of influenza on winter-seasonal mortality of 5% in an average season (<LINK REF="REF-Glezen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glezen 2006</LINK>). Until improvement of cohort study design is available, the use in non-RCTs of highly non-specific outcome indicators, such as all-cause mortality, is likely to lead to unrealistic estimates of the effects of the vaccines.</P><P>Evidence from RCTs, in which bias is reduced to a minimum, is scant and badly reported. Unfortunately, because of the global recommendations on influenza vaccination, placebo-controlled trials, which could clarify the effects of influenza vaccines in individuals, are no longer considered possible on ethical grounds.</P><P>Since publication of the first version of this review, we have noted increased reliance of the case test-negative study design to assess influenza vaccine effectiveness post hoc, that is after the influenza 'season'. The case test-negative design is described in detail elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Foppa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foppa 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valenciano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valenciano 2012</LINK>).</P><P>The data included in a case test-negative design are sometimes harvested from an ongoing networked surveillance cohort. In this case, the case test-negative design is described as 'nested' within the cohort. The source cohort can include community and hospitalised cases and controls, allowing flexibility. In Europe, the surveillance programme has a formal structure and is known as Influenza - Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness (I-MOVE). I-MOVE is partly funded and co-ordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (sites.google.com/site/epiflu/Home) (<LINK REF="REF-Kissling-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissling 2017</LINK>).</P><P>Briefly, the study design, which is similar to a case-control design, consists of selecting influenza cases (e.g. cases of ILI who have tested positive for influenza) and controls (cases of ILI who have tested negative) and calculating the relevant odds ratio (OR). Cases and controls are subsequently stratified by vaccination status. An estimate of vaccines effectiveness (VE) is derived from the OR of influenza in vaccinated/unvaccinated participants using the standard formula VE = 1 - OR%. The practice of using the OR estimate as an approximation of the risk ratio was first used in a 1980 study on pneumococcal vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Broome-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1980</LINK>).</P><P>Despite their popularity, test-negative designs have limited public health significance.</P><P>The design does not test field effectiveness, but the capacity of the vaccines to generate a negative polymerase chain reaction result (what we would call laboratory efficacy). Both cases and controls are symptomatic, so any prevention is solely focused on the negativity of laboratory tests. In addition, no useful public health absolute measures of effect can be derived (such as absolute risk reduction and its reciprocal number needed to vaccinate) by such designs, as the background rates of infection and viral circulation are not part of the calculation of the estimates of effect. The mathematical method first used by Broome and colleagues is correct if three key assumptions are met:</P><OL><LI>the risk of non-influenza ILI is the same in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals (a factor called &#8220;k&#8221; by Broome and colleagues) (<LINK REF="REF-Broome-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1980</LINK>);</LI><LI>the attack rate in the vaccinated population is low; and</LI><LI>the circulating serotypes are similar to those in the selected population within the case-control studies based on test-negative design.</LI></OL><P>All assumptions are unlikely to be fulfilled at the same time, especially in multicentre/multi country surveillance cohorts with a non-random sampling frame. For example, Cowling and colleagues reported an increased risk of non-influenza respiratory virus infections associated with receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine. In addition, the OR will give falsely high VE if the attack rate in the vaccinated population is high (<LINK REF="REF-Cowling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowling 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1985</LINK>). Apart from these fundamental design problems, case test-negative studies are also affected by poor reporting.

Because we are conscious that (despite the inconclusive evidence) we could have introduced our own biases into the reviewing process, we re-extracted and reassessed all studies included in this and all other reviews of influenza vaccine studies (259 primary studies, reporting 274 data sets). We worked independently in two teams of two, extracting directly into pre-set forms with rigid criteria but using the same quality assessment scales used in the original version of the review. As well as assessing quality of study design, we assessed concordance between data presented and conclusions and direction of conclusions (in favour or not of the performance of influenza vaccines). We also looked at the relationship between these variables and study funding and journal of publication. We found that higher-quality studies were significantly more likely to show concordance between data presented and conclusions (OR 16.35, 95% CI 4.24 to 63.04) and less likely to favour effectiveness of vaccines (0.04, 0.02 to 0.09). Government-funded studies were less likely to have conclusions favouring the vaccines (0.45, 0.26 to 0.90). A higher mean journal impact factor was associated with complete or partial industry funding compared with government or private funding and no funding (differences between means 5.04). Study size was not associated with concordance, content of take-home message, funding, or study quality. Higher citation index factor was associated with partial or complete industry funding (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009b</LINK>).</P><P>We concluded that the general quality of influenza vaccines studies is very low and that publication in prestigious journals is associated with partial or total industry funding. We could not explain this association with study quality, size or study status (registration trials using surrogate outcomes such as antibody titres were not included in the review).</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-12 11:02:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Nichol provides a useful overview of reviews of influenza vaccines in all age groups (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 2008</LINK>).

Our uncertainty in the effect on influenza reflects a lack of information about how the diagnosis was confirmed in the studies and judgements of high or unclear risk of bias.</P><P>The findings of our review indicate that implementing vaccination programmes for elderly people may lead to reductions in influenza and ILI, but randomised studies to date have provided insufficient data on complications. Very few deaths occurred in the trials, and no data on hospitalisation were reported. No cases of pneumonia occurred in one study that reported this outcome. The sparse nature of the data overall may reflect the low risk of developing complications in the healthy population of interest and low rates of ILI and influenza in the trials. Vaccination probably increases fever from 1.6% to 2.5% (moderate-certainty evidence) and may increase nausea from 2.4% to 4.2%, but for both of these harms the confidence interval is wide. Similar effects were observed for headache, general malaise, and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Sore arm and swelling occurred more frequently with vaccination.</P><P>Policymakers considering funding vaccine programmes and individuals contemplating vaccination should take into account the likely benefits in terms of the reductions in the risk of influenza and ILI (3.5% and 2.5%, respectively), uncertainty over complications, and possible increases in harms.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-12 11:03:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Investment in the development of better vaccines than are currently available should be linked to better knowledge of the causes and patterns of ILI in different communities. The additional effects of vaccinating carers in reducing transmission in nursing homes should be assessed. The effect of vaccination of high-risk groups should also be further assessed.</P><P>Until such time as the role of vaccines for preventing complications of influenza in the elderly is clarified, more comprehensive and effective strategies for the control of acute respiratory infections should be investigated. These should include several preventive interventions that take into account the multi-agent nature of ILI and its context (such as personal hygiene and adequate food, water, and sanitation).</P><P>When a new vaccination or preventive technology becomes available, an adequately powered, publicly funded, high-quality placebo-controlled trial run over several seasons should be undertaken. New insights on the role of viruses and other agents in the genesis of influenza and ILI are also needed.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-31 07:19:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley"><P>The 2016 update was funded by the Cochrane Review Support Programme.</P><P>The review authors wish to acknowledge Daniela Rivetti, Melanie Rudin and Lubna Al-Ansary as previous authors.</P><P>The authors gratefully acknowledge the following people for commenting on previous drafts: Amy Zelmer, Laila Tata, Lohne Simonsen, Sree Nair Maryann Napoli, Anne Lyddiat, Wendy Keitel, Ludovic Reveiz, Mark Jones, Chris Del Mar and Geoff Spurling.</P><P>For this 2016 update, we acknowledge help and comments received from Liz Dooley, Toby Lasserson, David Honeyman, Janet Wale, Soumyadeep Bhaumik, Mark Jones, and Jenny Doust.

Rivetti,</P><P>We have several questions about the review 'Vaccines for preventing influenza in the elderly'.</P><P>Although the authors recognized that "The findings of the cohort studies that we included are likely to have been affected to a varying degree by selection bias.", the reviewers drew conclusions that "in long-term care facilities, where vaccination is most effective against complications," based on the results of cohort studies that is not compatible with the strict prospective study method of RCT.</P><P>However they argued that RCT can minimize the bias, they concluded that extracted RCTs can offer no definitive evidence due to their scant and bad reports. If so, they should suggest a well-designed placebo controlled RCT of influenza vaccination for preventing influenza in the elderly.</P><P>Moreover they insist that placebo-controlled RCT is no longer possible on ethical ground, because the influenza vaccinations are globally recommended.<BR/>The statement is very surprising. If it is true, RCTs are no longer possible after the recommendations or medical interventions have been globally implemented, even though they are clearly erroneous. We think the idea is against Cochrane Collaboration's principle.</P><P>On the contrary, we cannot ethically accept the scant and bad situation itself of RCTs on the vaccine, because flu vaccinations have been awkwardly recommended all over the world without high level evidence.</P><P>The reviewers discussed that "Consistent with other published studies, during influenza season, vaccination was associated with a 44% reduction in risk of all-cause mortality during influenza season. However, in the period before influenza vaccination was associated with a 61% reduction in risk of this outcome."</P><P>In fact, Japanese cohort studies which evaluated the influenza vaccine have also large selection bias favourable to the vaccinated group in various outcomes including mortality, fever and absence from school.</P><P>For examples, in the cohort study of over 65 years old at Geriatric Health Service Facility<BR/>1) vaccination associated with a 51.9% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality during influenza season; but the mortality in the vaccinated group was 61.5% lower during extra-influenza season. This study also showed a 37.8% relative risk reduction in fever during influenza season, but fever rate in the vaccinated group was 37.3% lower during extra-influenza season.</P><P>In Japanese cohort studies which evaluated the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine for children<BR/>2) the vaccination was associated with a 12.2% relative risk reduction in fever during influenza season, but it also showed a 17.3% reduction prior to influenza season.</P><P>Moreover Takahashi K et al. reported the absence rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated students in Mie prefecture during influenza season and during prior to influenza season.<BR/>3) In the study of elementary school vaccination was associated with a 26.1% relative risk reduction in absence during influenza season, but it associated with a 23.7% reduction prior to influenza season. In the study of junior high school it associated with a 29.1% relative risk reduction during influenza season but it also associated a 31% reduction during prior to influenza season.</P><P>According to these cohort studies, the vaccinated groups revealed more increase of mortality, fever rate, or absence rate during influenza season relative to the extra-influenza season.</P><P>In conclusion, "no firm conclusions can be drawn from" the cohort studies, because of its large bias as the review authors suggest. However the cohort studies may become more reliable after the outcomes during influenza season corrected at least with the outcomes during non-influenza season, their results cannot replace evidences from well-designed placebo controlled RCT.</P><P>References<BR/>1) Hitoshi Kamiya.
