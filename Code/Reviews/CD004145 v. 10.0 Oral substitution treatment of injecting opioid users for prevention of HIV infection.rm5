<P>Injecting drug users are vulnerable to infection with HIV and other blood borne viruses as a result of collective use of injecting equipment as well as sexual behaviour. This review looks at original studies that reported the frequency or prevalence of risk behaviours, or information on HIV infection related to substitution treatment of opioid dependence to assess the extent to which oral substitution treatment prevents the transmission of HIV infection. It was not possible to accurately estimate the extent of reduction, but it is clear that oral substitution treatment reduces risk behaviours and also the probability of HIV infection amongst injecting drug users in substitution treatment.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:45:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Studies were required to consider the incidence of risk behaviours, or the incidence of HIV infection related to substitution treatment of opioid dependence. All types of original studies were considered. Two authors independently assessed each study for inclusion</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-04 01:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Thirty-eight studies, involving some 12,400 participants, were included. The majority were descriptive studies, or randomisation processes did not relate to the data extracted, and most studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. Studies consistently show that oral substitution treatment for opioid-dependent injecting drug users with methadone or buprenorphine is associated with statistically significant reductions in illicit opioid use, injecting use and sharing of injecting equipment. It is also associated with reductions in the proportion of injecting drug users reporting multiple sex partners or exchanges of sex for drugs or money, but has little effect on condom use. It appears that the reductions in risk behaviours related to drug use do translate into reductions in cases of HIV infection. However, because of the high risk of bias and variability in several aspects of the studies, combined totals were not calculated.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Oral substitution treatment for injecting opioid users reduces drug-related behaviours with a high risk of HIV transmission, but has less effect on sex-related risk behaviours. The lack of data from randomised controlled studies limits the strength of the evidence presented in this review.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:48:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-24 07:53:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>The importance of infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) lies in the high rates of premature morbidity and the high cost of treatment and care. The introduction of anti-retroviral combination therapy for those infected with HIV has delayed progression to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), but anti-retroviral therapy is limited by side effects, issues of resistance, and cost and is not available in all countries. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that expanding access to anti-retroviral therapy has contributed to a 19% decline in deaths among people living with HIV between 2004 and 2009. At the same time the organisation estimated that 10 million people living with HIV who are eligible for treatment under the new WHO guidelines are still in need (<LINK REF="REF-World-AIDS-Report-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">World AIDS Report 2010</LINK>). In this context, therefore, prevention of HIV infections remains vitally important.</P>
<P>Opioid use is a global phenomenon. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that in 2008 between 12.8 and 21.9 million people globally used heroin or illicit opiates in the prior 12 months, with the prevalence of opioid use ranging between 0.3% and 0.5% of the world's population aged 15-64, with estimates of 0.7% in Central Asia, 0.8-1.5% in near and middle East, 0.8-0.9% in Eastern/Southern East Europe (<LINK REF="REF-World-Drug-Report-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Drug Report 2010</LINK>). More than half the world's opioid users are in Asia. Heroin is used by the majority of opioid users and is the drug most associated with injecting use. Through injecting, the contribution of opioid use to the transmission of HIV has been, and is likely to continue to be significant (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Injecting drug users are vulnerable to infection with HIV and other blood borne viruses as a result of collective use of injecting equipment as well as sexual behaviour. The risk of virus transmission through injecting drug use is influenced by:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>epidemiological factors (viral load of the infected contact (<LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 2001</LINK>); the way in which injecting equipment is "shared" (<LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 1989</LINK>); individual susceptibility);</LI>
<LI>psychosocial factors (drug craving; intoxication; risk knowledge and attitude towards risk); and</LI>
<LI>environmental factors (hurried use in public places; access to clean injecting equipment; settings, such as prisons that are hostile to drug use).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Individuals who are new to injecting are particularly vulnerable to sharing injecting equipment as they may not know how, or be afraid, to inject themselves. They thus often ask a more experienced user (who already might be infected) for assistance. Gender differences in patterns of sharing injecting equipment with a partner and capacity to negotiate low-risk sexual practices and condom use are also relevant.</P>
<P>Since sharing or use of contaminated syringes and needles is a very efficient way of spreading HIV, it can spread very rapidly amongst injecting drug users (<LINK REF="REF-Des-Jarlais-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Des Jarlais 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stimson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stimson 1995</LINK>). For example, in the Russian Federation the number of registered drug abusers (mostly opioid users) rose from 65,000 in 1995 to 270,000 in 2000. In 1996, seven persons per million inhabitants were registered for the first time as having been infected by HIV as a consequence of injecting drug use. This rate increased to 248 persons per million inhabitants in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-UNDCP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNDCP 2002</LINK>). Similarly heroin use in Central Asia has led to a 19-fold increase in the number of officially registered HIV cases in the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-World-Drug-Report-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Drug Report 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is not only the spread of HIV/AIDS amongst injecting drug users themselves that is relevant. Injecting drug users infected with HIV can become a means of transmission to the general population through relationships with people who are not drug users, as well as transmission to unborn children by infected mothers. Links between drug use and commercial sex work are also significant to the spread of HIV beyond the population of injecting drug users. Indeed UNAIDS reports that the HIV epidemic is evolving. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, epidemics that were once characterized primarily by transmission among injecting drug users are now increasingly characterized by significant sexual transmission, including in parts of Asia, transmission among heterosexual couples (<LINK REF="REF-World-AIDS-Report-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">World AIDS Report 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Levels of HIV infection remain high among injecting drug users in many regions. In Asia, on average, an estimated 16% of people who inject drugs are living with HIV, while some samples suggest that one-quarter of injecting drug users in the Russian Federation and 39-50% in Ukraine may be HIV positive (<LINK REF="REF-World-Drug-Report-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Drug Report 2010</LINK>). Hence, injecting drug users represent a substantial pool of infection that could very quickly renew regional epidemics of HIV infection.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:48:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Interventions to reduce HIV transmission in injecting drug users include harm reduction measures (access to sterile injecting equipment, safe injecting facilities) and to treatment for drug dependence. Substitution treatment entails the prescription of a drug with action similar to the drug of dependence, but with a lower degree of risk. Individually adjusted and regular dosing prevents withdrawal without causing sedation and lessens the sense of euphoria or intoxication usually associated with each dose of the drug. The advantage of substitution treatment lies in the opportunity it provides for dependent drug users to stabilise in health and social terms before addressing the physical dimension of dependence. Psychosocial interventions are generally provided as a component of substitution treatment to help address the psychological and behavioural dimensions of dependence. The World Health Organization recommends that, at a minimum, psychosocial support should include assessment of psychosocial needs, supportive counselling and links to existing family and community services (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Worldwide, methadone syrup for oral intake is the pharmacological agent that is most commonly used for substitution treatment of opioid dependence. Usually "racaemic" dextro-levo-(DL)-methadone is used, but in a minority of cases in Germany levo-(L)-methadone is in use. Buprenorphine administered as a tablet placed under the tongue is increasingly being used. Levo alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM) was used to a limited extent in the USA, but was removed from the market because of concerns about potential cardiovascular effects. In Germany, in the early 1990s, codeine was the most commonly used substitution agent. Slow release oral preparations of morphine are emerging as alternative substitution agents.</P>
<P>There is some use of injectable preparations for substitution treatment, notably heroin in Switzerland, the Netherlands, the UK, and Germany. Evaluations of the latter approaches remain limited. This review focused on oral preparations (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM, codeine and slow release morphine).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-05-25 09:20:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>There is a widely held view that the provision of substitution treatment for opioid dependent injecting drug users is an important component of efforts to contain HIV infections. The effectiveness of substitution treatment in preventing HIV infections may arise in several ways, such as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>reduced craving for opioids, potentially leading to reduced urgency of use (when high risk use is more likely);</LI>
<LI>reduced use of illicit opioids;</LI>
<LI>reduced frequency of injecting drug use, thus directly reducing the probability of virus transmission;</LI>
<LI>reduced need to obtain illicit supplies thereby reducing high risk behaviours such as the exchange of sex for money or drugs;</LI>
<LI>greater control of drug use making injecting drug users more receptive to preventive messages;</LI>
<LI>reduced frequency of sharing of injecting equipment arising from reduced frequency of injecting use and greater awareness of risk reduction strategies; and</LI>
<LI>regular contact with treatment agencies increasing opportunities for medical and psychosocial interventions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There is evidence that substitution treatment for opioid dependent drug users who are HIV positive is associated with better compliance with anti-retroviral treatment and improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Antela-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antela 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spire-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spire 2007</LINK>). While the management of HIV infections and related conditions is an important part of overall efforts to control the spread of HIV, this aspect of substitution treatment is not addressed by this review.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-04 02:19:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Although it appears that the worldwide spread of HIV has peaked (<LINK REF="REF-World-AIDS-Report-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">World AIDS Report 2010</LINK>), the potential for renewed outbreaks in local regions or specific risk groups is very real. Injecting drug use continues to be a factor in the transmission of HIV. Dependence on opiates, particularly heroin, continues to be associated with injecting drug use. It follows that having an understanding of the capacity of substitution treatment to reduce HIV risk behaviours in injecting opioid users is important for continuing efforts to contain HIV/AIDS.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-02-04 02:23:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>To assess the effect of oral substitution treatment for opioid dependent injecting drug users on behaviours associated with a high risk of transmission of HIV and the incidence of HIV infections.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:50:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:49:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2011-05-24 09:44:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>The primary criterion for selection of studies was that they consider the prevalence of behaviours with high risk of HIV transmission, or patterns of HIV infection (seroprevalence or seroconversion, including further infection with different phenotypes of HIV), related to substitution treatment for opioid dependence. All types of original studies were considered.</P>
<P>Studies with retrospective collection of data on risk behaviour were excluded. Such studies were defined as those with one time point of data collection with participants being asked to recall their risk behaviour before and after commencement of substitution treatment.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-02-04 02:24:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Included studies involved opioid dependent drug users, the majority of whom were identified as injecting users, or with a recent history (last three months) of injecting drug use at the time of entry into the study. Studies involving participants using other injectable drugs in addition to opioids were also included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:49:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Experimental interventions involved the oral administration of full or partial opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM, codeine or oral morphine) for substitution treatment of opioid dependence. Interventions in which opioid agonists were administered by non-oral routes (e.g. heroin prescription) were excluded. The dose and duration of substitution treatment are factors that influence the outcomes of substitution treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kreek-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreek 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>). Hence we considered it desirable that studies included in the review reported details of the dose and duration of substitution treatment at the time outcomes were assessed. Many studies met this requirement but only to a limited extent. Lack of detailed information on the substitution treatment on its own was not considered grounds for exclusion, except where such data was essential to relate outcomes to substitution treatment. Studies that did not report detailed information of substitution treatment and also did not fully meet another criterion were excluded.</P>
<P>Comparisons were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>before and after a period of substitution treatment;</LI>
<LI>injecting drug users not in treatment; </LI>
<LI>injecting drug users receiving treatment not involving administration of an opioid agonist.</LI>
</UL>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:49:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:49:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Behaviours that are known to be associated with a high risk of transmission of HIV include sharing of injecting equipment (<LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 1989</LINK>) and unprotected sexual intercourse, particularly anal sex (<LINK REF="REF-Kaldor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaldor 1994</LINK>). These behaviours were rarely specifically reported, but high frequency injecting drug use, frequency of condom use, multiple sexual partners, and providing sex in exchange for money or drugs are all indicators of high risk activities. This review seeks to examine the impact of substitution treatment on all of these behaviours. Instruments (e.g. Risk Assessment Battery, Blood-Borne Virus Transmission Risk Assessment Questionnaire) have been developed for scoring the level of HIV risk with such instruments generally considering both injecting drug use and sexual behaviour. Studies reporting outcomes based on the use of such instruments were included.</P>
<P>Where studies considered the frequency of high risk behaviours before and after substitution treatment, it was required that similar data on these behaviours was collected for equivalent periods of time before commencement of treatment, and after a specified period of substitution treatment. Studies that compare risk behaviours in different time periods (for example one month prior to treatment compared to six months after treatment) were excluded.</P>

<P>The review also compares the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection for populations of injecting opioid users who receive oral substitution treatment, and those not participating in treatment or receiving other forms of treatment.</P>
<P>An area of debate has been whether any effect of substitution treatment on HIV risk is achieved primarily through changes in overall drug use, changes in levels of injecting use, or changes in high risk injecting practices (<LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gossop-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 2000</LINK>).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-24 10:02:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>In this version of the review, the approach to assessing methodological quality of included studies has been changed in line with the approach recommended in the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2008 </LINK>and criteria developed by the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Review Group for the assessment of prospective observational studies (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Reviews is based on the evaluation of six specific methodological domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and "other issues"). For each study the six domains are analysed, described as reported in the study and a final judgement on the likelihood of bias is provided.in terms of low, high or unclear risk of bias To make these judgements we used the criteria indicated by the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2008</LINK>, as adapted by the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group for applicability to the addiction field and incorporating criteria for observational studies. The criteria drawn from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the criteria developed from the EPOC Group (EPOC 2009) were used to assess the observational studies. The Risk of Bias tables were operationalized to be used both for the assessment of RCTs, CCTs, and  prospective observational studies. See <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for a detailed description of the criteria used.</P>
<P>We considered blinding separately for subjective and objective outcomes. Lack of blinding is a source of serious risk of bias for subjective outcomes (self-reported drug use and risk behaviour), but is less significant with objective outcomes, such as opioid use determined by urine screening, and HIV seroconversion.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-06-16 14:50:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Much of the data for this review was in the form of follow-up data, with HIV risk behaviour assessed before and after a period of substitution treatment. This provided a statistical problem in that outcomes "before" and "after" substitution treatment came from the same sample of participants (i.e. the samples were not statistically independent). The standard statistical methods embedded in the Cochrane software (Review Manager 5) are not appropriate for analysis of continuous data where samples are not independent. Many of the original studies used statistical approaches, such as ANOVA, that are appropriate for assessing change over time involving one or more groups of participants. Without access to individual patient data, it is not possible to apply more accurate tests of statistical significance. We have therefore taken the approach of summarising continuous, follow-up data in additional tables. These tables include the level of statistical significance determined during the original studies.</P>

<P>We undertook statistical analyses using Review Manager 5.

<P>As was expected, there were very few controlled studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review - this is likely to be due, at least in part, to ethical difficulties associated with allocating injecting opioid users to control groups that do not receive substitution treatment.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nature and setting of substitution treatment</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chawarski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chawarski 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2005</LINK>) used buprenorphine, in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Teesson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Teesson 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lawrinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrinson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schaub-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schaub 2009</LINK>) either buprenorphine or methadone were used, and <LINK REF="STD-Lott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lott 2006</LINK> compared methadone, buprenorphine and LAAM for substitution treatment. In the remaining studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review, methadone was the only drug used for substitution treatment (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The optimal dose of methadone should be determined for individual patients, but research evidence indicates that methadone doses ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>). Of the 35 studies using methadone, 14 studies reported average doses of 60mg/day or more, and seven studies reported average doses between 40 and 60mg/day. In 14 studies the methadone dose was either not reported or doses varied across a wide range. While it was generally not stated, these doses are assumed to relate to racaemic d,l-methadone. In Germany l-methadone has been used for substitution treatment of opioid dependence but in other countries the available preparation is the racaemic mixture.</P>
<P>In two studies methadone was provided, for at least one group of participants, in the context of detoxification rather than maintenance. In <LINK REF="STD-Iguchi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Iguchi 1998</LINK> the detoxification was scheduled to be completed in 90 days. Data on HIV risk behaviour was reported for weeks one and two of treatment while participants were stabilised on methadone (40mg/day) and weeks five and six at the commencement of the dose taper. Hence the study provides some insight into the immediate impact of methadone prescription on risk behaviours. <LINK REF="STD-Sees-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sees 2000</LINK> was designed as an RCT comparing methadone maintenance and 180-day methadone detoxification. At the 6-month follow-up both groups were receiving methadone and data from both groups are used to compare risk behaviour before and after substitution treatment. At the 12-month follow-up only participants in the maintenance group were receiving methadone. These data are used to compare HIV risk for current substitution treatment compared to treatment not involving substitution.</P>
<P>The setting for intervention (general primary health care, specialist drug and alcohol services or specialist infectious diseases services) could be a factor in substitution treatment outcomes relating to HIV prevention. In the majority of studies (32/38) substitution treatment was provided to participants in the context of a specialist drug and alcohol treatment program (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK>) treatment was provided in a prison setting. In <LINK REF="STD-Chawarski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chawarski 2008</LINK> treatment was provided in a primary health care setting, and in <LINK REF="STD-Gossop-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 2000</LINK> treatment was provided in both primary health care and specialist drug and alcohol treatment settings with these two settings being compared in one report derived from this study. In the remaining three studies the treatment setting was either not reported or participants were recruited from various sources making allocation to setting impossible. The lack of such data prevented consideration of the effect of treatment setting through subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>The majority of the studies (26 of 38) were undertaken in the USA, where primary health care providers are restricted in their ability to prescribe methadone and buprenorphine only became available for office-based settings within the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-Fudala-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fudala 2003</LINK>). Of the remaining studies, three were undertaken in the UK, three in Australia, one each in Italy, Germany, Canada, Malaysia, and Ukraine, while <LINK REF="STD-Lawrinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrinson 2008</LINK> was undertaken in multiple countries, many of which only introduced substitution treatment very recently and the approach remains generally restricted to specialist settings.</P>

<P>The risk of assessment bias for objective outcomes was considered high for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK>). There was no blinding in this study and there was potential for bias arising from knowledge of group allocation (continuation of MMT or cessation of MMT due to funding cuts). For all other studies the risk of assessment bias for objective outcomes (opioid use by urine screen, HIV seroconversion) was judged to be low as these outcomes are unlikely to be affected by an awareness of group allocation.

Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Camacho-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Camacho 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Finch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Finch 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gossop-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kwiatkowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiatkowski 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 2006</LINK>) were assessed as having a high risk of bias as there were differences between those participants included in analyses and those who dropped out.</P>
<P>In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brooner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brooner 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chawarski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chawarski 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Iguchi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Iguchi 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1995</LINK>) the risk of bias due to representativeness of the exposed cohort was unclear. In the remaining studies the risk of bias was judged to be low.</P>
<P>Bias due to selection of the non-exposed cohort and ascertainment of exposure was judged to be low for most studies. However, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> was judged to be at high risk of bias as information on receipt of MMT was reported by participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1992</LINK> the risk of bias was unclear as there was no description of the derivation of the non-exposed cohort, or the source of information on MMT.</P>

<P>The analyses included in this review present data according to the type of comparison (baseline compared to follow-up, or current substitution treatment compared to treatment not involving the administration of a substitute opioid). The results are presented here according to the nature of the outcome being considered, looking firstly at drug use behaviours, and then at sex-related behaviours. For reasons of statistical validity, only dichotomous data are presented in analyses comparing behaviour at baseline and follow-up. Associated continuous data are contained in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.</P>
<P>Combined totals have not been calculated for any of the analyses included in this review as the studies varied in a number of aspects and most studies were associated with a high risk of bias (see "Risk of bias in included studies" above) making the validity of combined totals doubtful.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Effect of substitution treatment on behaviours related to drug use</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1. Effect of substitution treatment on illicit drug use</HEADING>
<P>Data on the proportion of participants reporting illicit opioid use, or the proportion of positive urine samples, before and after a period of substitution treatment, were able to be extracted from 11 studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). A different set of 11 studies provided data on the frequency of opioid use, before and after a period of substitution treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In addition to length of follow-up (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>) and reporting period (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>) these studies also varied in the nature of outcome assessed and the means of reporting. Despite the variability in studies, all showed statistically significant decreases in opioid use (either as the proportion of opioid positive urine samples or the proportion of participants or the frequency of opioid use) from baseline prior to entry into methadone treatment and follow-up between five to six weeks and 12 months after entry. The relative risk of illicit opioid use at follow-up (six month) compared to baseline ranged from 0.31 for <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK> to 0.68 for <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2000</LINK> (corresponding to reductions in relative risk of 69% and 32%, respectively).</P>
<P>Data on illicit opioid use, or the proportion of positive urine samples, for participants currently in substitution treatment, compared to those in treatment not involving substitution, were able to be extracted from two studies (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). In both studies substitution treatment was associated with significantly less opioid use.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> reported data on the frequency of opioid use for cohorts of drug users currently or previously in methadone maintenance treatment, or with no history of methadone maintenance treatment. Data from the latter two cohorts were combined and entered into analyses as a comparison of participants receiving or not receiving substitution treatment at the time of interview (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kwiatkowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiatkowski 2001</LINK> reported the number of heroin injections by participants for 30 days prior to baseline and follow-up interviews for cohorts receiving risk reduction plus MMT or risk reduction only. Data from the six-month follow-up have been taken as a comparison of current methadone maintenance treatment with no methadone maintenance treatment and included in <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>. For both these studies heroin use was significantly less frequent for participants in substitution treatment.</P>
<P>Some studies reported data on cocaine use but the extent of injecting use of cocaine was unclear and these data were not used in this review. None of the included studies reported on amphetamine use as a possible basis for continued injecting drug use during substitution treatment.</P>
<P>On the basis of the data presented in this section, it is clear that substitution treatment is associated with a significant decrease in the proportion of participants using illicit opioids, and in the frequency of use, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Prevalence and frequency of injecting use</HEADING>
<P>Data on the proportion of participants reporting injecting drug use, before and after a period of substitution treatment, were able to be extracted from 11 studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Note that the data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Teesson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Teesson 2006</LINK> is the proportion of participants injecting daily, whereas the other studies report the proportion with any injecting use. This is likely to be the basis of the substantially different result for <LINK REF="STD-Teesson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Teesson 2006</LINK>. Ten studies reported data on the frequency of injecting use, before and after a period of substitution treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Camacho-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Camacho 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2000</LINK>) reported both the proportion of participants injecting and the frequency of injection.</P>
<P>All studies show a statistically significant decrease in injecting behaviour (either as the proportion of participants injecting, or the frequency of injecting drug use, or both) after entry into methadone treatment. The relative risk of injecting drug use at follow-up compared to baseline ranged from 0.40 for <LINK REF="STD-Magura-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Magura 1991</LINK> (at 12 months) and <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 2006</LINK> (at 24 weeks) to 0.80 at 6 month follow-up for <LINK REF="STD-Millson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Millson 2007</LINK> (corresponding to reductions in relative risk of 60% and 20%, respectively).</P>
<P>Data on the number of participants reporting injecting drug use for cohorts in substitution treatment or not in substitution treatment at the time of assessment were able to be extracted from five studies (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Meandzija-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meandzija 1994</LINK>) provided data on frequency of injecting use for cohorts of drug users receiving or not receiving substitution treatment at the time of a single interview. <LINK REF="STD-Kwiatkowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiatkowski 2001</LINK> compared HIV risk behaviour at intake and six-month follow-up in cohorts of injecting drug users receiving risk reduction plus methadone maintenance treatment or risk reduction treatment only. Hence the six-month follow-up data represents a comparison of behaviours in cohorts receiving or not receiving substitution treatment at the time of interview. Data from these three studies are presented together (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> translated the number of injections reported by participants into a frequency score, while <LINK REF="STD-Meandzija-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meandzija 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kwiatkowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiatkowski 2001</LINK> reported the actual number of injections in the prior 30 days. <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK> presents these data as a standardised mean difference to allow for the differing measures.</P>
<P>Again these studies all show significantly less injecting behaviour (either as the proportion of participants injecting, or the frequency of injecting drug use, or both in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Meandzija-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meandzija 1994</LINK>) for cohorts receiving substitution treatment compared to those not receiving substitution treatment at the time of assessment. The relative risk of injecting for substitution treatment compared to no substitution ranged from 0.45 for <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK> to 0.87 for <LINK REF="STD-Metzger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Metzger 1993</LINK> (corresponding to reductions in relative risk of 55% and 13%, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Teesson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Teesson 2006</LINK> recruited 745 individuals entering treatment for opioid dependence (methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment, detoxification, or residential rehabilitation) and 80 heroin users not seeking treatment. At baseline 80% were injecting daily (78% of the maintenance group, 84% of the detoxification group, 75% of the residential rehabilitation group and 83% of the no-treatment group). At the 3-month follow-up, 19% were injecting daily (9% maintenance, 26% detoxification, 9% residential rehabilitation, 50% no treatment). At 1-year follow-up 17% were injecting daily (7% of the maintenance group, 23% of the detoxification group, 15% of the residential rehabilitation group and 36% of the no-treatment group). The differences between the groups in prevalence of daily injecting at baseline, and variability in the extent of exposure to treatment after recruitment into the study make these data difficult to interpret. Nonetheless the analyses are suggestive of a greater decrease in injecting behaviour with maintenance treatment relative to no treatment, and probably also other forms of treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK> compared outcomes for opioid users in prison randomly allocated to receive methadone maintenance treatment, or a waiting-list control, with access to methadone maintenance guaranteed after four months. This study provided data both on the change in injecting drug use associated with a period of substitution treatment and a comparison between substitution treatment and standard care not involving substitution treatment, albeit in the somewhat unique setting of a prison. The proportion of the methadone maintenance group reporting injecting drug use decreased from 64% at baseline to 34% at follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). In contrast, there was no significant change in the proportion of waiting-list controls reporting injecting drug use (70% at baseline, 75% at follow-up). Similarly those in the methadone maintenance group reported a greater decrease in the number of heroin injections in the month prior to follow-up, compared to baseline (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). As a result, at three months, significantly fewer participants in the methadone maintenance group reported injecting drug use (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies provided additional information on the effect of substitution treatment on injecting drug use by comparing HIV risk behaviour in cohorts of drug users continuing in or ceasing substitution treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> two cohorts of injecting drug users were followed. At baseline participants in both cohorts were receiving methadone maintenance treatment. At follow-up, one year later, one cohort remained in treatment while the other cohort had ceased treatment as a result of a subsidised treatment no longer being available. The data reported shows that for the cohort remaining in methadone treatment the frequency of injecting use was similar at baseline and follow-up, while the cohort who ceased methadone treatment reported a significant increase in the days of heroin injecting at follow-up. However, at baseline the cohort who would be ceasing treatment reported more days of heroin injecting in the prior six months. While the difference was not statistically significant, it raises questions about the selection of participants to have funding ceased and also the possibility of some exaggeration of levels of injecting use reported, perhaps with the intent of reversing the decision to cease funding.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK> compared HIV risk behaviour at intake and 12-months follow-up for cohorts of opioid users who remained in or had left methadone maintenance treatment at the time of follow-up. At intake the mean days of intravenous drug use in the month prior to interview was similar for the two cohorts (29.4 and 29.3 days respectively) but at follow-up the frequency of intravenous drug use was higher for the cohort that had left treatment (8.7 versus 3.7 days). Furthermore, the authors noted a significantly increased level of incarceration at follow-up for the cohort off methadone treatment, suggesting that this contributed to the reduction in intravenous drug use in this cohort.</P>
<P>In summary, it is clear that substitution treatment is associated with a significant decrease in the proportion of participants reporting injecting drug use, and in the frequency of injection, even without calculation of an overall quantitative estimate of the extent of the decrease. This benefit may not be sustained following cessation of methadone treatment, particularly if cessation of treatment is not voluntary. Although it is clear that both illicit opioid use (see previous section) and injecting use decrease with substitution treatment, it is not possible to relate the decrease in injecting use to decreased opioid use.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Sharing of injecting equipment</HEADING>
<P>In addition to its pharmacological effects, substitution treatment provides an opportunity for delivery of information about means of reducing the transmission of HIV. Hence substitution treatment may reduce risk behaviour, even amongst those who continue to inject.</P>
<P>Data on the proportion of participants reporting sharing of injecting equipment, before and after a period of substitution treatment, were able to be extracted from 12 studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>All 12 studies showed a reduction in the proportion of participants reporting sharing of injecting equipment at follow-up compared to baseline. The difference was statistically significant for 11 of the 12 studies. The exception, <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK> was a relatively small study and the 95% confidence interval was large preventing the relative risk from achieving statistical significance. The relative risk of sharing of injecting equipment at follow-up compared to baseline ranged from 0.14 at three months for <LINK REF="STD-Teesson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Teesson 2006</LINK> to 0.75 at 6 months for <LINK REF="STD-Grella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grella 1996</LINK> (corresponding to reductions in relative risk of 86% and 25%, respectively).</P>
<P>A further five studies provided data on the proportion of participants reporting sharing of injecting equipment for cohorts of drug users in substitution treatment compared to those receiving no or limited substitution treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK> or <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). In three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metzger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Metzger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>) the relative risk of sharing of injecting equipment was significantly less in the cohort receiving substitution treatment. In the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiede-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thiede 2000</LINK>) the relative risk was less for the cohort in substitution treatment, but the difference did not achieve statistical significance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kwiatkowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiatkowski 2001</LINK> compared HIV risk behaviour at intake and six-month follow-up in cohorts of injecting drug users receiving risk reduction plus methadone maintenance treatment or risk reduction treatment only. Participants in both groups reported a reduced frequency in use of dirty needles and in sharing of paraphernalia in the 30 days prior to follow-up compared with intake, with no significant difference between the cohorts in the extent of reduction.</P>
<P>Two studies provided additional information on the effect of substitution treatment on the sharing of injecting equipment by comparing HIV risk behaviour in cohorts of drug users continuing in or ceasing substitution treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> two cohorts of injecting drug users were followed. At baseline participants in both cohorts were receiving methadone maintenance treatment. At follow-up, one year later, one cohort remained in treatment while the other cohort had ceased treatment as a result of subsidised treatment no longer being available. The data reported show that for the cohort remaining in treatment there was a reduction in the days of needle sharing in the six months prior to interview (from 13.51±28.56 at baseline to 0.51±1.22 at follow-up). In contrast, for the cohort who ceased methadone treatment, the days of needle sharing in the 6 months prior to interview increased from 24.93±32.18 at baseline to 39.07±77.46 at follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK> compared HIV risk behaviour at intake and 12-month follow-up for cohorts of opioid users who remained in or had left methadone maintenance treatment at the time of follow-up. Both cohorts reported reductions in days with use of an uncleaned needle in the prior month (from a mean of 5.9 to 0.7 for the cohort continuing in MMT and from 7.2 to 2.4 for the cohort ceasing MMT) and in days in which they gave an un cleaned needle in the prior month (from a mean of 6.4 to 0.8 for the cohort remaining in MMT and from 8.1 to 2.8 for the cohort ceasing MMT).</P>
<P>These data suggest that substitution treatment is usually associated with a significant decrease in the sharing of injecting equipment. From the data available, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the reduction in sharing behaviour is due to a reduction in injecting behaviour. It appears that similar reductions in the sharing of injecting equipment can be achieved by forms of treatment other than substitution, and reductions may be sustained even after cessation of substitution treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 Scores of drug-related risk</HEADING>
<P>Rating scales are available for the assessment of HIV-risk behaviours; several different scales were used by studies included in this review. These instruments typically provide separate ratings of drug-related and sex-related risk as well as an overall score. This section considers only drug-related risk.</P>
<P>Data on drug-related risk scores of participants, before and after a period of substitution treatment, were able to be extracted from seven studies. As indicated in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>, these studies varied in the instrument used to assess risk behaviour. In six of the seven studies there was a statistically significant decrease in drug-related risk score from baseline to follow-up. The exception was <LINK REF="STD-Sees-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sees 2000</LINK> where there was a reduction in the mean score for six months prior to follow-up, compared to intake for both the methadone maintenance and 180-day methadone detoxification groups, but the associated standard deviations were large preventing the reductions from achieving statistical significance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> compared drug risk scores for cohorts of injecting drug users currently or previously in, or with no prior history of, methadone maintenance treatment. Data from the latter two cohorts were combined and entered into analyses as a comparison of current substitution and no substitution treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK> also provided a comparison of drug risk scores for users currently in substitution treatment and users not in substitution treatment. In both studies the mean score is significantly lower for the cohort receiving substitution treatment at the time of interview. <LINK REF="STD-Sees-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sees 2000</LINK> compared MMT with 180-day methadone detoxification; at 12-month follow-up the detoxification group had not been prescribed methadone for 6 months. These data were entered in <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK> as a comparison of substitution treatment and treatment without substitution. While the drug-related risk score was lower for the group still in substitution treatment, the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>These data of drug-related HIV risk scores are consistent with data on prevalence and frequency of injecting and sharing of injecting equipment in showing a significant reduction in risk associated with substitution treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Effect of substitution treatment on sexual behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Behaviours with a high risk of HIV transmission are more likely in association with commercial sex work to finance drug purchases, or the exchange of sexual favours for drugs than sexual behaviour with a regular partner. In addition drug use impedes the negotiation of the use of protection, and breaks down inhibitions, further reducing the likelihood of protected sex.</P>
<P>Substitution treatment, by reducing drug use, can reduce the need for exchange of sex for drugs or money. Furthermore, substitution treatment provides the opportunity for interventions including strategies for reducing HIV risk and negotiating the use of protection during sex.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Multiple sex partners or commercial sex work</HEADING>
<P>Commercial sex work is generally assumed to be associated with higher risk of HIV transmission, and multiple sex partners is probably indicative of commercial sex work. Hence these outcomes are considered together.</P>
<P>Five studies reported data only on the proportion of participants reporting multiple sex partners before and after a period of substitution treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Three studies reported data on the proportion of participants reporting exchange of sex for drugs or money (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Grella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grella 1996</LINK> reported data on both these outcomes.</P>
<P>In four of the five studies, significantly fewer participants reported multiple sex partners following substitution treatment, but only <LINK REF="STD-Grella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grella 1996</LINK> found significantly fewer participants reported exchanges of sex for drugs or money following substitution treatment, compared to baseline prior to substitution treatment. Relatively few participants in <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK> reported these behaviours either before or after substitution treatment resulting in a very wide confidence interval and no significant difference in either of these outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 2006</LINK> also had a wide confidence interval.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Metzger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Metzger 1993</LINK> injecting drug users in or out of treatment were recruited for a longitudinal study, with data on HIV risk behaviour collected at baseline. Significantly less participants in substitution treatment reported exchanges of sex for drugs or money in the six months prior to study entry (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK> compared the HIV risk behaviours of injecting drug users recruited from a needle exchange program, methadone maintenance treatment, or a detoxification program. Data from the needle exchange and detoxification programs have been combined and compared with data for the methadone maintenance group (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). This shows significantly less participants in methadone maintenance treatment reported exchanges of sex for drugs or money in the six months prior to interview.</P>
<P>Two studies reported data on the number of participants reporting multiple sex partners for cohorts in substitution treatment compared to those in treatment not involving substitution (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). In both studies less participants in substitution treatment reported multiple sex partners. The difference was statistically significant for <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK> but not <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Meandzija-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meandzija 1994</LINK> compared cohorts of injecting drug users in MMT, or currently not in treatment, with additional subgroup analyses based on HIV status. They found no significant difference by HIV or MMT status in the average number of sex partners in the prior 30 days. However, participants in MMT reported giving sex for drugs or money significantly fewer times in the prior 30 days, compared to those not in treatment (with no significant difference by HIV status).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> compared HIV risk behaviour in cohorts of drug users continuing in, or ceasing, substitution treatment. For the cohort continuing in substitution treatment the mean number of sex partners in the prior six months decreased (from 2.39±11.4 at baseline to 0.89±0.97) at one-year follow-up. For the cohort ceasing substitution treatment the number of sex partners increased (from 15.9±64.78 to 25.95±111.58). These data are difficult to interpret given the significant difference between the groups at baseline, but are not inconsistent with data from other studies.</P>
<P>Given the small number of studies it is difficult to be conclusive, but these data are at least indicative of substitution treatment being associated with a lower incidence of multiple sex partners or exchanges of sex for drugs or money.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Unprotected sex</HEADING>
<P>The delivery of information about means of transmission of HIV in the context of substitution treatment may reduce risk behaviour, separately from any change in sex-related risk behaviour associated with drug use.</P>
<P>Data on the proportion of participants reporting unprotected sex, or the use of condoms in half or less of occasions before and after a period of substitution treatment, were able to be extracted from seven studies (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). It should be noted that some studies reported data on the proportion of participants using protection. These data were converted to proportions not using protection to make the data consistent with that reported by other studies.</P>
<P>In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Camacho-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Camacho 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gossop-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Margolin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Margolin 2003</LINK>), less participants reported unprotected sex at follow-up compared to baseline, and the difference was statistically significant. In the other three studies less participants reported unprotected sex at follow-up, but the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Metzger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Metzger 1993</LINK> injecting drug users in or out of treatment were recruited for a longitudinal study, with data on HIV risk behaviour collected at baseline. The authors noted that for sexually active participants from either group (12% out-of-treatment, 15% in-treatment) were using condoms on a regular basis. <LINK REF="STD-Stark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 1996</LINK> also compared cohorts of injecting drug users in or not in methadone maintenance treatment at the time of interview. A smaller proportion of participants in methadone treatment reported unprotected sex, but the difference did not achieve statistical significance (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Meandzija-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meandzija 1994</LINK> reported the frequency of condom use in the 30 days prior to interview for cohorts of injecting drug users currently in methadone maintenance treatment or not in treatment with no significant difference on the basis of treatment status. However, HIV positive participants in both groups reported significantly higher frequency of condom use.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1999</LINK> reported the frequency of unprotected sex and the number of unprotected partners for a cohort of injecting drug users in the six months prior to entry into substitution treatment, and at 12-month follow-up. The frequency of unprotected sex declined from 3.7 at baseline to 3.3 at follow-up, and the number of unprotected partners declined from 1.5 at baseline to 1.3 at follow-up.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> the cohort continuing substitution treatment reported 0.84±0.8 unprotected sex partners in the six months prior to baseline, and 0.54±0.86 at 12-month follow-up, respectively. For the cohort ceasing substitution treatment the number of unprotected sex partners increased from 0.8±0.7 at baseline to 25.7±111.64. The large standard deviation makes this result difficult to interpret. Furthermore, as noted previously, the context of the study is such that consideration should be given to participants having exaggerated self-report data in the hope of getting reinstated to subsidised methadone treatment.</P>
<P>Overall, these data suggest no change, or only small decreases, in unprotected sex associated with substitution treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Scores of sex-related risk</HEADING>
<P>The various scales available for the assessment of HIV-risk behaviours generally incorporate a rating of sex-related risk as well as drug-related risk.</P>
<P>Data on sex-related risk scores of participants before and after a period of substitution treatment were able to be extracted from seven studies (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Significant reductions in sex-related risk score at follow-up compared to baseline were reported by six of the seven studies. <LINK REF="STD-Sees-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sees 2000</LINK> also reported a reduction (with the score assessed using the Risk of AIDS Behaviour Scale) but the reduction did not achieve statistical significance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> compared sex-risk scores for cohorts of injecting drug users currently or previously in, or with no prior history of methadone maintenance treatment. Data from the latter two cohorts were combined and entered into analyses as a comparison of substitution and no substitution treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK> reported sex-related risk scores for participants in methadone maintenance treatment, those attending a needle exchange and those in a detoxification program. Data for the needle exchange and detoxification groups were combined and compared with the methadone maintenance group (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sees-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sees 2000</LINK> compared MMT and 180-day methadone detoxification in a randomised controlled trial. At 12-month follow-up, one group remained in MMT while the comparison group was no longer in MMT. Data from the 12-month follow-up has been entered as substitution versus no substitution (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK> the scores were significantly lower for the methadone maintenance group (standardised mean difference -0.49, 95% CI -0.70, -0.28), but there was no significant difference in sex-related risk scores in <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Sees-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sees 2000</LINK>.</P>

<P>The various scales available for the assessment of HIV-risk behaviours also allow for calculation of a rating of overall risk (combining both drug-related and sex-related risk). Such data were reported for seven studies (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Six studies reported a significant reduction in overall HIV risk for participants from baseline to follow-up after entry to substitution treatment.

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Serpelloni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Serpelloni 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1992</LINK>) compared exposure to methadone maintenance treatment for cohorts of injecting drug users who converted to HIV positive, or remained seronegative. These data were reported in different ways preventing their use in analyses. The data are reviewed narratively here.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Metzger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Metzger 1993</LINK> identified two cohorts of injecting drug users according to whether they were in or out of substitution treatment, and followed them for 18 months.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moss-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 1994</LINK> followed injecting drug users with multiple HIV tests over a five-year period, comparing those who seroconverted with those who remained HIV negative.

For those recruited from methadone maintenance treatment the incidence rate was 1.4% per person year (95% CI 0.7 to 2.4) while for those recruited from detoxification programs it was 3.1% per person year (95% CI 1.6 to 5.3).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Serpelloni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Serpelloni 1994</LINK> undertook a similar analysis in a nested case control study, comparing exposure to methadone treatment for cases of seroconversion and a matched group determined to be seronegative within 30 days of the seroconversion date of cases.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-25 09:22:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Effect of substitution treatment on drug use behaviours</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Illicit drug use</HEADING>
<P>Substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine primarily addresses opioid use. Mattick and colleagues, in Cochrane reviews of substitution treatment based on methadone and buprenorphine, conclude that such treatment is associated with reductions in illicit opioid use (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2008</LINK>). The data presented in this review indicates that substitution treatment with methadone is associated with reductions in injecting drug use and illicit opioid use. However, it was not possible to determine to what extent the reduction in injecting drug use can be attributed to overall reductions in opioid use. It is also unclear to what extent continued injecting behaviour is related to the use of non-opioid drugs. Cocaine can be used by injection; some studies included in this review reported reductions in cocaine use associated with substitution treatment, but it was not possible to relate these reductions to reductions in injecting behaviour. There is a trend worldwide for injecting drug users to be polydrug users (i.e. using a number of different drugs). Amphetamines also are sometimes used by injection, but none of the studies included in this review commented on amphetamine use. Assessing the extent of reduction of HIV risk behaviour associated with substitution treatment of injecting opioid users will therefore require further knowledge of use of non-opioid drugs, and particularly further knowledge of the drugs being injected by those who continue injecting behaviour after entry into substitution treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Injecting drug use</HEADING>
<P>The data from studies included in this review indicate that substitution treatment is associated with a significant decrease in the proportion of participants reporting injecting drug use, and in the frequency of injection.</P>
<P>The follow-up periods used by the studies from which data on injecting drug use was obtained ranged from three to 12 months. The data from the studies included in this review suggests that substantial reductions in injecting drug use occur in the first one to three months of treatment, with these reductions being sustained for at least the first year of treatment. However, it would be of interest to understand in more detail the patterns of change in risk behaviour, and particularly whether both the proportion of participants reporting injecting drug use and the frequency of injection decline with increasing duration of substitution treatment. At present there are not enough studies with multiple follow-up points for such an analysis to be undertaken.</P>
<P>The studies varied in the means of reporting the frequency of injecting drug use. <LINK REF="STD-Camacho-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Camacho 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 1995</LINK> reported the actual number of injections during the assessment period. A problem with this approach is that these data tend to be very skewed, with a small number of participants reporting very high frequencies of injecting. <LINK REF="STD-Chatham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chatham 1999</LINK> sought to overcome this problem by translating the number of injections into a frequency score. While this might be appropriate for analysis of an individual study, in the context of a systematic review, the value of frequency score data is limited unless other studies use the same scoring system. An alternative approach that also overcomes skew to some extent is the use of days of injecting use, rather than the number of injections. This approach was used in <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2000</LINK>. A further advantage of using days of injecting as the outcome measure is that participants might be expected to recall days of use more accurately than the actual number of injections.</P>
<P>The issue of recall accuracy also arises in relation to the reporting period for assessment of risk behaviours. This was another source of variability in the studies, with the period ranging from two weeks to six months. Clearly with longer periods the risk of recall bias would be increased, even with the use of appropriate count-back methods. Another issue with longer assessment periods is a reduction of sensitivity. In particular, the capacity to detect trends in behaviour change is lost. For example, if the proportion of participants injecting declines steadily over a six-month period of substitution treatment, this would not be detected by a single assessment based on the six months of treatment. However, it would be detected by the use of two or three assessment points each based on the 30 days prior to interview. An assessment period of 30 days was used by the majority of studies included in this review, and appears to be generally accepted as a standard period for assessments based on self-report data. Another advantage of a 30-day period is that objective measures of drug use such as hair analysis could be used to corroborate at least some aspects of the self-report data. With longer reporting periods it is very difficult to corroborate self-report data.</P>
<P>Most of the studies included in this review assess the changes in HIV-risk behaviour over time during a period of substitution treatment. Very few studies compared substitution treatment with another treatment approach (eg. psychological therapy) or no treatment, and even fewer assessed changes in HIV-risk behaviour over time for substitution treatment compared to another form of treatment or no treatment. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Metzger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Metzger 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meandzija-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meandzija 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2006</LINK> indicate that, compared to no treatment, methadone maintenance treatment is associated with significant reductions in injecting drug use, at least at a single time point. <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2003</LINK> demonstrated that the provision of methadone maintenance treatment in a prison setting results in a significant reduction in injecting drug use, compared to a waiting-list control group. <LINK REF="STD-Kwiatkowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiatkowski 2001</LINK> assessed changes in injecting drug use over time for substitution treatment compared to another form of treatment. Methadone maintenance treatment was associated with a significantly greater reduction in injecting drug use, but the comparison approach (risk reduction treatment) was also associated with a reduction in injecting drug use over time, albeit not as great as the reduction seen with methadone maintenance. This is another area where further research is required. At present data are insufficient to compare methadone with other pharmacotherapies, such as buprenorphine and slow-release oral morphine with confidence, and there are also different types of psychosocial intervention, in addition to risk reduction, which should be compared with substitution treatment in terms of capacity to reduce HIV-risk behaviour. Most controlled trials comparing methadone with other substitution pharmacotherapies rely on urine screening and retention in treatment as primary outcome measures. Including an assessment of HIV-risk behaviour as an outcome measure in controlled trials would add a further important dimension to the assessment of effectiveness of alternative substitution therapies.</P>
<P>While it is clear that substitution treatment is associated with reductions in injecting drug use, the duration of this benefit is unclear. The data from <LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thiede-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thiede 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> indicate there is relapse to injecting drug use following cessation of methadone treatment. This was particularly marked in <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK> where cessation of maintenance treatment was imposed on participants as a result of funding cuts. Hence, this issue of the durability of effect from substitution treatment is another area where additional information would be useful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Sharing of injecting equipment</HEADING>
<P>The data from studies included in this review suggest that substitution treatment is associated with a significant decrease in the sharing of injecting equipment. It would be of interest to know the extent to which the reduction in sharing was due to an overall reduction in injecting use, but it was not possible to investigate this on the basis of the studies included in this review.</P>
<P>The only data that could be extracted from multiple studies were the proportion of participants reporting sharing of injecting equipment. A number of aspects influence the risk of each episode of sharing (<LINK REF="REF-Bornemann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bornemann 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Grund-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grund 1996</LINK>) including the setting in which sharing occurred and whether any attempts were made to clean equipment (in a street, shooting gallery or prison compared to a private home, there is little opportunity for cleaning of equipment), whether the individuals involved in sharing were strangers (and hence of unknown disease status), or friends, and the different variants of equipment sharing (regarding the use of needles, syringes, spoons, filters, water). Some studies reported this level of detail, but not enough for comparison across studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 Scores of drug-related risk</HEADING>
<P>Assessment of drug use behaviours with validated instruments with rating scales is expected to be associated with less risk of bias than self-report data on individual behaviours. The rating scales for assessment of HIV-risk behaviours generally combine measures of injecting drug use and sharing of injecting equipment to produce a score of drug-related risk. This is of value in terms of deriving a variable that can be analysed statistically. However, in the context of a systematic review the value is reduced by variability in the rating scale used and in the means of reporting scores. Some reporting of individual behaviours encompassed in the rating scale would be helpful in understanding the changes underlying a change in rating score, and would also provide for comparison with data from studies that have used different rating scales, or that have not used a scale at all.</P>
<P>While the use of rating scale scores was somewhat problematic, these data were consistent with the findings in relation to injecting drug use and sharing of injecting equipment in that the studies that reported scores also showed a significant reduction in risk associated with substitution treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Effect of substitution treatment on sexual behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Sexual behaviours with a high risk of HIV transmission include anal sex (<LINK REF="REF-Kaldor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaldor 1994</LINK>), sexual intercourse in the presence of local trauma and epithelial damage or concurrent sexually transmitted infection (<LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 2001</LINK>), and unprotected sex with multiple partners. These specific behaviours were generally not reported by the studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Hence we relied on alternative outcome measures, specifically multiple sex partners or exchange of sex for drugs or money and unprotected sex, as indicators of high risk behaviour.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data on sexual behaviour to be conclusive as to the effect of substitution treatment. However, it appears that substitution treatment is associated with a lower incidence of multiple sex partners or exchanges of sex for drugs or money, but has little effect on the use of condoms.</P>
<P>Rating scales for sex-related risk generally combine risks derived from multiple sex partners, exchange of sex for drugs or money, and unprotected sex. As with drug-related risk, sex-related risk scores have value as a variable that can be analysed statistically, but variability in the nature of the rating scale and means of reporting scores reduce the value of such data in the context of a systematic review. Again, the data from the rating scales were consistent with separate data in that they indicate that substitution treatment can be associated with reductions in sex-related risk behaviours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Overall risk</HEADING>
<P>Scores of overall HIV-risk are calculated by combining the scores for drug-related and sex-related risk. The studies that calculated overall risk scores found a significant reduction in scores associated with substitution treatment, with this reduction largely attributable to the significant reductions in drug-related risk.</P>
<P>Few data and variability in the means of reporting limit the conclusiveness of any analysis of the incidence of HIV infections, but the studies included in this review consistently indicate lower rates of seroconversion (HIV incidencer) associated with substitution treatment. This suggests that reductions in risk behaviour do translate into actual reduction in cases of HIV infection. For participants in substitution treatment who are already HIV positive, the reductions in risk behaviour would also be expected to translate into reduction in the transmission of HIV from those infected individuals to others not yet infected. Substitution treatment may also protect individuals already infected with HIV against superinfection with other strains of HIV, or other blood-borne viruses. Furthermore, while it was not specifically addressed by this review, there is also evidence that substitution treatment for opioid dependent injecting drug users who are HIV positive is associated with better compliance with treatment and improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Antela-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antela 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spire-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spire 2007</LINK>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-25 07:28:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>This review focuses on substitution treatment for injecting drug users who are primarily opioid dependent. Cocaine and amphetamines are also used by injection but apart from limited short-term use of dexamphetamine for the treatment of amphetamine dependence, there is currently no substitution treatment available for cocaine or amphetamine users. The extent to which cocaine and amphetamine use contribute to continued HIV risk behaviour amongst clients of opioid substitution treatment programs is currently unclear.</P>
<P>Opioid substitution treatment worldwide is predominantly based on oral administration of methadone or sublingual administration of buprenorphine. The focus of this review on oral opioid substitution treatment reflects the predominant form of treatment, and enabled the use of changes in injecting behaviour as a major outcome measure. There is limited use of pharmaceutical heroin and injectable preparations of methadone for opioid substitution treatment. It would be valid to assess the effectiveness of substitution treatment involving injectable preparations in terms of prevention of HIV risk behaviours, but this would require some adjustments to outcome measures and we considered it preferable for this review to focus on oral medications.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-05-25 08:39:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>There are relatively few studies that relate data on behaviours with high risk of HIV transmission to substitution treatment of injecting opioid users. Even fewer studies relate the incidence of HIV infection to substitution treatment. We identified 38 studies, involving some 12,400 participants, that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Of these 38 studies, 25 studies contributed data to the analyses in the review, and data from 19 studies are summarised in tables (11 studies contributed data to both analyses and tables). Five studies are discussed in the text but no data were extracted: two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK>) considered HIV risk behaviour after cessation of opioid substitution treatment, and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Serpelloni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Serpelloni 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1992</LINK>) considered the incidence of HIV infections relative to oral substitution treatment.</P>
<P>Variability in the nature of outcomes assessed and the way in which outcome data are reported limited the capacity to assess the effectiveness of substitution treatment of injecting opioid users for prevention of HIV infection. We have sought to overcome these limitations by considering data from a wide range of study types, and by looking for consistency of findings across those study types. This approach does not allow for any quantitative estimate of the extent to which substitution treatment reduces the risk of HIV transmission, but it does provide a clear indication of whether there is a change, and the direction of change.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-05-25 08:59:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>The major source of bias in this review comes from the need to rely predominantly on follow-up studies that report data on HIV risk behaviour before and after a period of substitution treatment. As a result the majority of the studies included in the review were assessed as having a high risk of selection bias. There is also some bias from reliance on participant reporting of subjective outcomes. However, studies have demonstrated the validity of self-report data that is collected through structured interviews by researchers not involved in the delivery of client services (<LINK REF="REF-Darke-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darke 1998</LINK>), and several studies used urine screening to support self-report data. Despite the potential risk of bias, the studies are consistent in finding that oral substitution treatment is associated with a reduction in HIV risk behaviours - it is the magnitude of effect that is likely to be most affected by any bias. The high risk of bias was one reason contributing to the decision not to quantify the magnitude of effect.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-25 09:18:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>A previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Marsch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsch 1998</LINK>) of methadone maintenance treatment found a consistent, statistically significant relationship between methadone maintenance treatment and the reduction of illicit opiate use, HIV risk behaviours and drug and property-related criminal behaviours. The effect on HIV risk behaviours was considered to be small to moderate.</P>
<P>No other equivalent systematic reviews of the effect of oral substitution treatment on HIV risk behaviours have been identified.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-08 05:31:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Following entry of opioid-dependent injecting drug users into substitution treatment, the proportion reporting injecting drug use and the reported frequency of injecting use both decrease. The change over time is statistically significant but it is not possible, on the basis of available data, to quantify the magnitude of reduction.</P>
<P>The long-term duration of the effect of substitution treatment is unclear. Relapse to illicit opioid use is common following cessation of substitution treatment but it is not clear to what extent risk reduction strategies are practiced following cessation of substitution treatment.</P>
<P>Levels of sharing of injecting equipment also decrease significantly following entry into substitution treatment. It is not possible, on the basis of available data, to determine to what extent the reduction in sharing behaviour is due to overall reductions in injecting use.</P>
<P>Similarly, substitution treatment is associated with reductions in illicit opioid use, but it is not possible, on the basis of available data, to determine to what extent the reduction in injecting use is due to overall reductions in illicit opioid use.</P>
<P>It appears that substitution treatment is associated with a reduction in the proportion of opioid-dependent injecting drug users reporting multiple sex partners or exchanges of sex for drugs or money. However, substitution treatment has little or no effect on the use of condoms.</P>
<P>Available data are limited, but it appears that the reductions in risk behaviour related to drug use do translate into actual reductions in cases of HIV infection amongst opioid-dependent injecting drug users receiving oral substitution treatment.</P>
<P>The lack of data from controlled studies limits the strength of the evidence presented in this review. However, these findings add to the stronger evidence of effectiveness of substitution treatment on drug use and treatment retention shown by other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2009</LINK>). On this basis, the provision of substitution treatment for opioid dependence in countries with emerging HIV and injecting drug use problems as well as in countries with established populations of injecting drug users should be supported.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-24 09:42:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>There is a need for greater consistency in reporting of injecting behaviour. Both the number of individuals injecting and the frequency of injecting should be reported. 'Days of injecting use' is preferable as an outcome measure as it is less subject to skew, and it is more readily compared across studies.</P>
<P>Similarly, the number of individuals sharing injecting equipment, the frequency of sharing and how equipment is shared should be reported. In addition it is desirable to know the number of drug users involved in sharing episodes, and whether sharing occurs with a core group of known users or strangers as these are significant indicators of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Kretzschmar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kretzschmar 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>More detailed information on various aspects of drug use in relation to HIV risk, and general trends in drug use is desirable. Such information should include responses to substitution treatment for those abusing prescription opioids relative to those using heroin, shifts from injecting to intranasal or inhalational use, and concomitant changes in HIV risk behaviour.</P>
<P>When collecting self-report data on behaviours, extended periods of retrospective reporting should be avoided because of the risk of recall errors, reduced capacity to corroborate self-report data, and reduced capacity to detect trends over time.</P>
<P>The capacity to compare methadone maintenance with other forms of substitution treatment or other types of treatment in terms of effectiveness in reducing HIV-risk behaviour is currently limited by a lack of data. Clinical trials of substitution treatments for opioid dependence tend to focus on objective indicators of opioid use (often the results of urine screening) as primary measures of effectiveness, with specific HIV-risk behaviour data not reported, and possibly not collected. Given that preventing the transmission of HIV and other blood-borne viruses is a strong reason for the provision of substitution treatment, such data should be collected and reported for trials of treatment effectiveness.</P>
<P>Studies of substitution treatments for opioid dependence tend to monitor, usually through urine screening, use of a range of drugs in addition to illicit opioids. It is important to determine changes in patterns of use of a range of drugs associated with substitution treatment for opioid dependence, but to assess sources of HIV risk, what is needed is information on which drugs are being injected by those who continue injecting drug use even whilst receiving substitution treatment.</P>
