<P>We are still waiting for firm evidence on Chinese herbal medicines for treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the use of herbal medicines for treatment of diabetes has a long history especially in the East, current evidence cannot warrant to support the routine use in clinical practice. This systematic review evaluates the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with type 2 diabetes. The review shows that some herbal medicines lower blood sugar and relieving symptoms in patients with diabetes. However, the methodological quality of the clinical trials evaluating these herbs is generally poor. The analyses also indicate that trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. However, the trials did not report significant adverse effects. In conclusion, herbal medicines should not be recommended for routine use in diabetic patients of type 2 diabetes until we get scientifically sound trials. Testing the herbs in larger, well-designed trials is needed in order to establish the necessary evidence for their use.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-30 18:33:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (CENTRAL), the Chinese BioMedical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, combined with hand searches on Chinese journals and conference proceedings. No language restriction was used.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials of herbal medicines (with at least two months treatment duration) compared with placebo, pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:41:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the parameters of randomisation, allocation concealment, double blinding, and drop-out rates. Meta-analyses were performed where data were available.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:41:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Sixty-six randomised trials, involving 8302 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was generally low. Sixty-nine different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, which compared herbal medicines with placebo, hypoglycaemic drugs, or herbal medicines plus hypoglycaemic drugs.
<BR/>

<BR/>Compared with placebo, <I>Holy basil leaves</I>,<I> Xianzhen Pian</I>, <I>Qidan Tongmai</I>, traditional Chinese formulae (TCT), <I>Huoxue Jiangtang Pingzhi</I>, and <I>Inolter </I>showed significantly hypoglycaemic response. Compared with hypoglycaemic drugs including glibenclamide, tolbutamide, or gliclazide, seven herbal medicines demonstrated a significant better metabolic control, including <I>Bushen Jiangtang Tang, Composite Trichosanthis, Jiangtang Kang, Ketang Ling, Shenqi Jiangtang Yin, Xiaoke Tang</I>, and <I>Yishen Huoxue Tiaogan</I>. In 29 trials that evaluated herbal medicines combined with hypoglycaemic drugs, 15 different herbal preparations showed additional better effects than hypoglycaemic drugs monotherapy. Two herbal therapies combined with diet and behaviour change showed better hypoglycaemic effects than diet and behaviour change alone. No serious adverse effects from the herbal medicines were reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:41:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Some herbal medicines show hypoglycaemic effect sin type 2 diabetes. However, these findings should be carefully interpreted due to the low methodological quality, small sample size, and limited number of trials. In the light of some positive findings, some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high-quality trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:42:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:19:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups-CRGs'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>There are two types of diabetes mellitus: type 1 insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 non-insulin dependent (NIDDM). Type 2 diabetes mellitus, the most common form, is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and two to four fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-McKinlay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinlay 2000</LINK>). Diabetes affects women and men of all ages and every ethnic category, and many cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed for an average of 4 to 7 years (<LINK REF="REF-McKinlay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinlay 2000</LINK>). Diabetes profoundly affects quality of life and represents a life-long burden on a patient's social support system. Diabetes places large financial demands on the health care system (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:42:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>For the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the initial recommendations include adaptation of diet, weight loss if appropriate, and exercise. If this regimen does not keep blood glucose levels within the normal range, anti-hyperglycaemic agents are prescribed, which include metformin and sulphonylurea drugs, or insulin. Because of the chronicity of diabetes, the impact of the disease on quality of life, the possibility of severe complications, and the requirements for self-care, it is not unlikely that diabetic patients will seek complementary / alternative therapies (<LINK REF="REF-McGrady--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrady 1999</LINK>), for example using food supplements or herbal medicines. Some goals of these therapies are to lower blood glucose levels, to decrease dosage of oral anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, to decrease insulin resistance, and to assist in managing the complications of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ivorra-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivorra 1989</LINK>; McGrady 1999).</P>
<P>Herbal medicine forms the main part of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which is a 3000-year-old holistic system of medicine combining medicinal herbs, acupuncture, food therapy, massage, and therapeutic exercise for both treatment and prevention of diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Fulder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulder 1996</LINK>). Traditional Chinese Medicine has its unique theories for concepts of aetiology, systems of diagnosis, and treatment which are vital to its practice. The theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine include Yin-Yang (representing the opposite principles and balance between positive and negative systems in the body),the five elements(fire, earth, metal, water, and wood), Qi (vital energy) and blood, Zhang-Fu (five viscerae and six bowels), and channels and collaterals (Meridian doctrine) (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2000</LINK>). Diseases are considered to result from internal causes as well as external causes, which are defined as disturbances e.g. the imbalance between Yin and Yang. The drug treatment of Chinese medicine consists typically in complex prescriptions of a combination of several components. This combination is based on specialChinese diagnostic patterns i.e. inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpation.Herbs are used for correcting the imbalance of Yin-Yang in the body and maintaining kinetic balance under the movement of five elements. Bianzheng Lunzhi (differentiation of symptoms and prescription of drugs) is the application of these theories.</P>
<P>Medicinal herbs have been widely used for more than 2000 years to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus ('Xiao Ke Bing' in ancient records of Traditional Chinese Medicine). In the late 1970's, clinical investigations were reported on the use of herbal medicines (both different single herbs and mixtures of herbs) as a means of treating diabetes and its complications (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 1980</LINK>). The mechanism of action of the herbal medicines involves regulating glycaemic metabolism, decreasing cholesterol levels, eliminating free radicals, increasing secretion of insulin, and improving microcirculation (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1999</LINK>). Until March 1999, 14 herbal medicines (13 mixture of herbs and one extract of single herb) [see <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>] were officially approved for the treatment of diabetes by the State Drug Regulatory Authority of China (<LINK REF="REF-CMH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMH 1999</LINK>); and 13 herbal medicines [see <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>] were listed in the National Essential Drugs by the State Drug Administration of China (<LINK REF="REF-SDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SDA 2000</LINK>). Almost all the herbal medicines are so called 'Chinese proprietary medicines', i.e. they are usually based on well-established and long-standing recipes and formulated as tablets or capsules for commerce, convenience, or palatability. However, active ingredients of these herbal medicines are largely unknown and they are combined to formulate herbal medicines. A number of clinical trials have been reported on the subject in Chinese medical journals during the past 20 years. The first randomised trial was reported in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1991</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:21:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The results of the trials suggest that treatment with Chinese herbal medicines may have great potentials for reducing hyperglycaemia and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, there are reports of liver toxicity and kidney damage or even cancer associated with using Chinese herbal medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Ishizaki-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishizaki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melchart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melchart 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottieb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottieb 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomlinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomlinson 2000</LINK>). The potential role and safety for long-term use of herbal medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus needs to be systematically reviewed to assess the current practice and direct the continued search for new treatment regimens.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were eligible for this review. Ideally, trial participants, people administering the treatment and outcome assessors would all have been blinded, but single-blinded and unblinded trials were also considered and their effect on the overall results were assessed in a sensitivity analysis.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:42:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Adults (18 years or older) with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. To be consistent with changes in diagnostic criteria of type 2 diabetes mellitus through the years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>), the diagnosis should have been established using the diagnostic criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial. Ideally, diagnostic criteria should have been described. These changes may have produced significant variability in the inclusion criteria, in the clinical characteristics of the patients included as well as in the results obtained. These differences we reconsidered and explored using sensitivity analyses.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-29 13:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The quality of reporting each trial was assessed based largely on the quality criteria specified by Schulz and Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). In particular, the following factors we restudied:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?</LI>
<LI>Minimisation of performance bias - were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention if blinding was possible?</LI>
<LI>Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was analysis by intention-to-treat?</LI>
<LI>Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</LI>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-01 13:25:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixty-six randomised trials were included in this review. We excluded 35 randomised trials due to a treatment duration of less than two months, or outcomes reported not relevant to this review. We also excluded 18 randomised trials wherethe study objectives were to treat diabetic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, diabetic foot,or retinopathy. The included trials compared different herbal medicines or combinations with hypoglycaemic agents versus placebo, hypoglycaemic agents, or dietary and lifestyle modification in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. All trials measured surrogate outcomes, some evaluated symptoms or adverse events. Some herbal medicines seemed to improve blood glucose control in terms ofanormalisation or a reduction of fasting blood glucose, reduction of HbA1c or an increase of serum insulin levels. However, one should be cautious in interpreting the findings due to low methodological quality, general small sample size, and limited number of the trials identified for individual herbal medicine.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, six herbal preparations, <I>Holy basil leaves, Xianzhen Pian, Qidan Tongmai</I>, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCT), <I>Huoxue Jiangtang Pingzhi</I>, and <I>Inolter</I>, seemed to improve blood glucose control. While single herbal preparations <I>Bauhinia forficata, Myrcia uniflora,</I> and <I>Ginseng</I> appeared not to be effective on blood glucose control. An interesting positive finding from <I>Xianzhen Pian</I> in a meta-analysis of three trials warrants further trial.</P>
<P>Comparisons of herbal medicines with hypoglycaemic drugs showed better hypoglycaemic responses for <I>Bushen Jiangtang Tang, Composite Trichosanthis, Jiangtang Kang, Ketang Ling, Shenqi Jiangtang Yin, Xiaoke Tang,</I> and <I>Yishen Huoxue Tiaogan</I>. The oral antidiabetic drugsinclude glibenclamide, tolbutamide, or gliclazide. Herbal medicines that showed no significant difference compared to hypoglycaemic agents included <I>Jianpi Jiangtang Tang, Jiangtang No 1, 2, 3, Jinqi Jiangtang Tang, Shenqi Yuxiao Tang, Shengqing Jiangtang recipe, Shuizhi Sanhuang Tang, Tangfu Kang, Tangning Pian, Tianyuan Jiangtang Wan, Xiaoke Yin, Yiqi Yangyin Huayu Tang, Yiqi Yangyin Huoxue recipe, </I>and <I>Yuquan Wan</I>. Two herbal medicines <I>Kelening</I> and <I>Xiaoke Ling</I> seemed to beless effective than glibenclamide.</P>
<P>The evidence appearsnot strong enough to arrive at a clinical recommendation due to the following limitations.</P>
<OL>
<LI> All herbal medicines that were tested against hypoglycaemic agents were mixtures composed of several different herbs. The majority of the herbal preparations were prescribed by the investigators, and the formulae were usually tailored to individual patients based on differentiation of the patients 'syndrome'. Therefore, the quality of the preparations cannot be assured.</LI>
<LI>No herbal medicine was tested more than once except <I>Xianzhen Pian</I>. Any of the eventual positive findings need to be confirmed.</LI>
<LI>The sample size was generally small.</LI>
<LI>Few of the trials used blinding methods. If a trial is not blinded, especially the outcome assessors, there may be a possibility of performance bias and detection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Twenty-nine out of 66 included trials evaluate combination treatment of herbal medicines with hypoglycaemic agents compared with hypoglycaemic agents alone. Additional hypoglycaemic benefit from the combined treatment as found in the herbal preparations including <I>Danzhi Xiaoyao San, Jiangtang Fang, Jiangtang Tiaozhi Tang, Jianpi Huatan Huoxue, Jinli Da, Qimai Dahuang Tang, Shugan Jianpi Huoxue Tang, Xiaoyao San, Yiqi Yangyin Qingre</I> and <I>Jianpi Zhuyun Yishen Huayu, Potentilla composite, Qingre Huatan Huoxue Huayu, Tianyuan Jiangtang Wan, Yishen Jiangtang Fang</I>, and <I>Zhonghui Chuanhuang Ye</I>. All these herbal preparations are mixtures of herbs, and most of them were prescribed by the investigators without definite quality standard regarding the preparation process. Interpretation of these findings is difficult considering the above mentionedlimitations of trials. This systematic review tries topoint to some herbal medicines which deservefurther examination.<BR/>
<BR/>Patient relevant outcomes such as incidence of mortality, complications, quality of life, and costs were not investigated. Symptoms improvement was inadequately reported.</P>
<P>This systematic review has several limitations. First, most of the included trials suffer from methodological issues such as poor quality in terms of randomisation and blinding. This may be associated with exaggerated effects of the herbal interventions due to subjected to systematic errors (bias). Potential bias may happen in selection of patients, administration of treatment, and assessment of outcomes. Methodologically less rigorous trials show significantly larger intervention effects than trials with more rigor (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>). Empirical study has shown that Chinese trials are significantly affected by publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>). Accordingly, when interpreting the present findings, publication bias should be taken into consideration. Second, most of the trials had small sample size. Although some data analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between herbal medicines and hypoglycaemic drugs, the results are likely to have been underpowered. Therefore, the analyses from the size of these trials may not establish with confidence that two interventions have equivalent effects (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piaggio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piaggio 2001</LINK>). Third, we do not have evidence that any of the herbs compared with hypoglycaemic agents has beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus from placebo controlled trials. All trials reported end-of-treatment responses, and we do not know long term responses due to lack of follow-up. Fourth, almost all herbal medicines in the included trials were tested only once except <I>Xianzhen Pian</I>, which made it impossible to pool data. Fifth, ninety per cent of the trials was conducted on Chinese participants. It is therefore not possible to perform subgroup analysis on ethnic origin. We are not sure if the results are valid and applicable to other ethnic group, e.g., Caucasian patients.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety of herbal medicines in type 2 diabetes</HEADING>
<P>The herbal medicines evaluated in this review generally appeared to be safe. However, we do not conclude on the safety of using herbal medicines in diabetic patients as adverse effects were not sufficiently reported.In clinical trials beneficial and harmful effects should receive equal attention, and the recording and reporting ofadverse effects should be improved.</P>
<P>Our review findings conform to a finding from recently published systematic review on herbs and dietary supplements for glycaemic control in diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 2003</LINK>). This review concluded that there is still insufficient evidence to draw substantial conclusions about the efficacy of individual herbs for diabetes. However, our review differs from this review in several aspects. First, we only included randomised clinical trials comparing herbal medicines with placebo or hypoglycaemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus with anintervention duration exceeding two months. The review by Yeh and colleagues included both randomised and non-randomised controlled trials with interventions including both herbs and dietary supplements in both types of diabetic patients and healthy individuals. Secondly, we did not limit our search strategy to studies published in English only. Actually, we thought non-English literature to beimportant and identified alarge number of Chinese trials, many of which were not indexed and found in other databases. Thirdly, the criteria for quality assessment were different. We did not only use Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) for methodological quality assessment but also analysed individual components of methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Western herbal medicines are often standardised extracts of single herbs used for particular conditions. In comparison, Chinese herbal medicines are quite often composed of mixtures of up to 20 different herbs. Besides, they are sometimes customised for each individual patient by the practitioners based on the differentiation of the patients' 'syndrome'. Therefore, trial design, could be adapted to the 'individualised treatment' by stratification of practitioners of the 'syndromes'. On the other hand, it is very important to investigate the herbal medicines according to a set of criteria which include preparation consistent with description in the pharmacopoeia, chemical standardisation, biological assays, animal models, and clinical testing (<LINK REF="REF-Yuan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuan 2000</LINK>). At least, in future trials it is necessary to improve the description of herbal medicines being tested, for example, plant species, geographical origin, harvest season, preparation procedures and quality of the products.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on this systematic review, some herbal medicines have beneficial effects on blood glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, at the momentwe cannot recommend any of the examined herbs for clinical routine use, since the majority of the trials had low methodological quality and the benefit has not been confirmed by large trials of high-quality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trialsin comparing Chinese herbal medicine with established hypoglycaemic drugs should be designed according to 'equivalence principle'. It is also interesting to verify additional benefits from herbal medicine combined with established hypoglycaemic drugs versus hypoglycaemic drug monotherapy. Outcome measures should include patient relevant outcome parameters. Standardised monitoring and reporting should be used for assessment of adverse events.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of randomised trials of herbal medicines for type 2 diabetes needs to be improved. The following aspects should be addressed: (i) detailed reporting of the methods used to generate allocation sequence and allocation concealment; (ii) sufficient application of double blinding with the use of adequate placebo; (iii) clear descriptions of withdrawal/drop-out during the trial and use of intention-to-treat analysis; (iv) reporting of clinically important outcome measures from long-term follow-up; and (v) reporting of the trial according to the CONSORT statement (www.consort_statement.org). </P>
