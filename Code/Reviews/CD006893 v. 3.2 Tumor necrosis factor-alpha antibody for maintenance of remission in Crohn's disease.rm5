<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines. Crohn's disease frequently occurs in the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum), however it can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptoms of Crohn's disease are abdominal pain, often in the lower right region of the abdomen, and diarrhea. TNF is a molecule secreted by white blood cells that increases inflammation. High levels of TNF-alpha have been associated with the development of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. TNF-alpha blocking agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol and CDP571) bind with TNF-alpha molecules thereby neutralizing the biological activity of TNF-alpha resulting in the healing of intestinal inflammation. All four molecules are synthetic antibodies that bind TNF. Infliximab (Remicade®) is an antibody of mouse origin that has been humanized, as is CDP571. Adalimumab (Humira®) is an antibody of human origin. Certolizumab is a humanized antibody fragment that is complexed with polyethylene glycol to extend the length of time the drug is in the body. Nine studies were reviewed. The studies compared TNF-alpha blocking agents with placebo (inactive intravenous infusions or injections) and found that infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol were effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease who respond to induction therapy with these agents. There is no evidence that CDP571 is an effective maintenance therapy. The TNF-alpha blocking agents appear to be safe for patients with Crohn's disease with equal numbers of patients receiving TNF-alpha blocking agents or placebo reporting side effects such as headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and pain at injection site. There were some serious side effects reported with the use of these agents including infections such as tuberculosis. However, patients can be screened for inactive tuberculosis prior to treatment with TNF-alpha. A link between long term treatment with TNF-alpha blocking agents and cancer is possible but not proven. Data obtained from observational studies including the Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation and Assessment Tool (TREAT) registry show no increased risk of cancer with the use of TNF-alpha blocking agents in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The current evidence suggests that the TNF-alpha blocking agents infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol are effective maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. However, the use of these medications needs to be weighed against the potential risk of serious side effects, particularly infection.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease may be refractory to conventional treatments including corticosteroids and immunosuppressives. Recent studies suggest TNF-&#945; blocking agents may be effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of TNF-&#945; blocking agents in the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for relevant studies published between 1966-2007. Manual searches of references from potentially relevant papers were performed to identify additional studies. Experts in the field and study authors were contacted to identify unpublished data. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials involving patients <U>&gt;</U> 18 years with Crohn's disease who had a clinical response or clinical remission with a TNF-&#945; blocking agent, or patients with Crohn's disease in remission but unable to wean corticosteroids, who were then randomized to maintenance of remission with a TNF-&#945; blocking agent or placebo</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent authors performed data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial. Outcome measures reported in the primary studies included clinical remission, clinical response, and steroid-sparing effects. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-01 12:40:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Nine studies met all inclusion criteria. Four different anti-TNF-&#945; agents were evaluated (infliximab in 3 studies, CDP571 in 3 studies, adalimumab in 2 studies, and certolizumab in 1 study). There is evidence from three randomized controlled trials that infliximab maintains clinical remission (RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.80), maintains clinical response (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.76), has corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 3.13; 95% CI 1.25 to 7.81), and maintains fistula healing (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.04) in patients with Crohn's disease with a response to infliximab induction therapy. There were no significant differences in remission rates between infliximab doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. There is evidence that adalimumab maintains clinical remission, clinical response, and has corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with Crohn's disease who have responded or entered remission with adalimumab induction therapy. There were no significant differences in remission rates between adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week. There is evidence from one randomized controlled trial that certolizumab pegol maintains clinical remission (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.16) and maintains clinical response (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.13) in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. There is no evidence to support the use of CDP571 for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Infliximab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, given every 8 weeks, is effective for the maintenance of remission and maintenance of fistula healing in patients who have responded to infliximab induction therapy. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to adalimumab induction therapy. Certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. No comparative trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of these agents. Adverse events are similar in the infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab groups compared with placebo, but study size and duration generally are insufficient to allow an adequate assessment of serious adverse events associated with long-term use. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition involving the gastrointestinal tract that is characterized by recurrent exacerbations and remissions. The cause and cure of Crohn's disease remains unknown, with current therapies aimed at inducing and maintaining remission, improving quality of life, and minimizing adverse events of medical therapy. At this time, there is no consensus on what constitutes optimal therapy for Crohn's disease. There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that the immunosuppressives methotrexate and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine are effective for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1998</LINK>). However, patients may not respond or may not be able to tolerate conventional therapy with these medications. </P>
<P>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been shown to have important immunomodulatory properties in animals and humans. Studies have shown increased TNF-&#945; levels in the serum and intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reimund-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reimund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breese-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breese 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Komatsu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Komatsu 2001</LINK>). Initial evaluation of the TNF-&#945; blocking agent infliximab found that infliximab reduces disease activity in patients with active Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-van-Dullemen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dullemen 1995</LINK>), and there is now evidence from several randomized controlled trials that TNF-&#945; blocking agents are effective induction agents for active Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2006</LINK>). A recent Cochrane systematic review found that infliximab is effective for inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2003</LINK>). Several studies have been published assessing TNF-&#945; blocking agents for the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease. A systematic review evaluating the use of anti-TNF-&#945; agents for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease is indicated. </P>

<P>Manual searches to identify key conference abstracts from 1995 onwards were performed [i.e. Gastroenterology (American Gastroenterological Association); Gut (British Society of Gastroenterology); American Journal of Gastroenterology (American College of Gastroenterology)]. References from recent reviews and published articles were searched to identify additional citations. Unpublished data from on-going trials was identified by correspondence with authors and experts in the field. The manufacturers of infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab were contacted for additional information.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Selection criteria<BR/>Randomized controlled trials involving patients with Crohn's disease who had a clinical response or clinical remission with a TNF-&#945; blocking agent, or patients with Crohn's disease in remission but unable to wean corticosteroids, who were then randomized to maintenance of remission with a TNF-&#945; blocking agent.</P>
<P>Data collection and analysis<BR/>Both authors (BWB and SJB) independently reviewed full texts and assessed eligibility of the trials based on the inclusion criteria described above. The methodological quality of selected trials was assessed by the two authors using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) and the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>The criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook are summarized below: <BR/>A. adequate allocation concealment;<BR/>B. allocation concealment unclear; and<BR/>C. inadequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The Jadad scale is a validated five point scoring system that measures several factors that impact on trial quality. The scale is defined below:<BR/>a. was the study described as randomized? (yes = 1, no = 0)<BR/>b. was the method of randomization well described and appropriate? (yes = 1, no = 0)<BR/>c. was the study described as double-blind? (yes = 1, no = 0)<BR/>d. was the double blinding well described and appropriate? (yes = 1, no = 0)<BR/>e. were withdrawals and dropouts described? (yes = 1, no = 0)<BR/>One point was deducted if the described method of randomization or blinding was inappropriate.</P>
<P>Disagreement among authors on the methodological quality of the selected studies was resolved by consensus. Publication bias was assessed by examining the authors and institutions involved, journal of publication, funding sources, and the affiliation of authors with manufacturers. </P>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and results from relevant studies and entered data into a pre-defined data extraction form. The extracted data included patient demographics such as age, disease distribution, disease duration, and concomitant medications, the type of disease activity scoring instrument used, treatment and control modalities, the number of patients randomized into each treatment group, the number of patients maintaining remission and stopping steroids, the duration of treatment and follow up, and the number of patients lost to follow up. In cases where data was not available from the published reports, attempts were made to obtain data by contacting the author. </P>
<P>Statistical analysis<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 4.2.9). All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test, with significance regarded as a P value = 0.10. The results were expressed as the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The relative risk was calculated using a fixed effects model when statistical heterogeneity was not present. A random effects model was used to calculate the relative risk when heterogeneity was present. Study data relating to secondary outcomes (e.g. adverse events) were described qualitatively. The definitions of clinical remission and clinical improvement were set by the authors of each paper, and the data were combined for analysis only if these definitions were sufficiently similar, as determined by consensus.</P>

</METHODS>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search strategy identified 27 randomized controlled trials on the use of anti TNF-&#945; antibodies in Crohn's disease. Eleven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Targan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Targan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_haens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">D'haens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lemann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lemann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2007a</LINK>) were excluded because they described the use of TNF-&#945; blocking agents for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. One study evaluating infliximab was excluded because only children were evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Hyams-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hyams 2007</LINK>). One study evaluating certolizumab pegol (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2007c</LINK>) was excluded because it reported combined induction and maintenance data and it was not possible to completely evaluate maintenance therapy in clinical responders based on the published data. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geboes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Geboes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2006a</LINK>) were excluded as primary studies because they were subgroup analyses of included trials. The remaining nine randomized controlled trials that were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sands-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2007</LINK>) satisfied all inclusion criteria and were included in the review. </P>
<P>STUDIES EVALUATING INFLIXIMAB</P>
<P>Three randomized controlled trials evaluating infliximab for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease were identified. All three studies used the CDAI to assess clinical disease activity and used the IBDQ to assess disease-related quality of life. However, there were differences in study populations and study design, including infliximab dosing, frequency of infusions, study duration, and definitions of clinical response. <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK> evaluated patients with a clinical response to a single infusion of infliximab 10 mg/kg or placebo, who were then randomized to infliximab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 8 weeks until week 44. <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK> evaluated patients with a clinical response to a single dose of infliximab 5 mg/kg, who were then randomized one of three arms: placebo at week 2 and 6 and then every 8 weeks thereafter, infliximab 5 mg/kg at week 2 and 6, then 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter, or infliximab 5 mg/kg at week 2 and 6, then 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter until week 54. <LINK REF="STD-Sands-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2004</LINK> evaluated patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease who received open-label infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Responders were then given either infliximab 5 mg/kg or placebo every 8 weeks until week 54. This study was evaluated separately from the other two because of differences in patient population. Safety evaluations were reported for all three trials. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>
<BR/>Rutgeerts et al. conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of infliximab versus placebo in patients with active Crohn's disease. Patients with active Crohn's disease (CDAI 220 to 400) were given a single dose of infliximab 10 mg/kg or placebo. Patients who had a clinical response (CDAI reduction <U>&gt;</U> 70 from baseline) to the initial infusion were randomized to infliximab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 8 weeks until week 44. Seventy-three patients were randomized to infliximab 10 mg/kg (n = 37) or placebo (n = 36). The primary study outcome was the number of patients who maintained a clinical response to infliximab or placebo over the study duration. Secondary outcomes included the number of patients maintaining a clinical remission (defined as a CDAI &lt; 150) at each 4-week evaluation and the proportion of patients who discontinued because of lack of efficacy. All patients were evaluated for safety. Disease-related quality of life was assessed by the IBDQ. Corticosteroid-sparing was not assessed. Patients in the placebo arm who developed increased disease activity were not eligible to cross over to open-label infliximab therapy. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK> <BR/>In this study, 573 patients with Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the benefit of maintenance infliximab therapy in patients with active Crohn's disease who had responded to a single infusion of infliximab. Patients with active Crohn's disease (CDAI 220 to 400) were recruited from 55 centers in North America, Europe, and Israel and received a 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of infliximab at week 0. Clinical response to infliximab was defined as a reduction in CDAI of <U>&gt;</U> 70 and at least a 25% reduction in total CDAI score at week 2. After assessing response at week 2, patients were assigned to one of three treatment arms: repeat infusions of placebo at weeks 2 and 6, then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 48, or infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 2 and 6, followed by either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter. The co-primary endpoints were the time to loss of response up to week 54 in the patients who had responded to an initial dose of infliximab, and the proportion of week 2 responders that were in remission (CDAI &lt;150) at week 30. Secondary endpoints included the assessment of infliximab corticosteroid-sparing effects and an assessment of infliximab safety. The IBDQ was used to assess health-related quality of life. At week 14, patients who initially responded to infliximab but then worsened were eligible to cross over to active episodic treatment, comprised of 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg infliximab on an as-needed basis. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sands-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2004</LINK> <BR/>In this study, 306 patients with Crohn's disease with one or more draining abdominal or perineal fistulas were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. CDAI scores were not part of the study inclusion or exclusion criteria. Patients were given infliximab 5 mg/kg on weeks 0, 2, and 6 and were then randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 5 mg/kg of infliximab intravenously every 8 weeks. Patients were followed to week 54. The primary outcome was the time to loss of response among patients with an initial response to the induction regimen of infliximab at week 14; response was defined as a reduction in the number of draining fistulas of at least 50 percent from baseline. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who maintained a clinical response to infliximab or placebo, defined as a reduction in baseline CDAI of 220 or greater by at least 25 percent and 70 points, and change in IBDQ. Adverse events were recorded at each study visit. Corticosteroid-sparing was not assessed. Starting at week 22, patients who had a loss of response were eligible to cross over to 5 mg/kg from the placebo arm, or 10 mg/kg from the 5 mg/kg treatment arm. </P>
<P>STUDIES EVALUATING ADALIMUMAB</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK> <BR/>In this multicenter study, 854 patients with active Crohn's disease (CDAI 220 to 450) received open-label induction therapy with adalimumab 80 mg subcutaneously at week 0 followed by 40 mg subcutaneously at week 2. At week 4, patients were stratified by response (CDAI decrease <U>&gt;</U>70 points from baseline) and randomized to one of three arms: placebo, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or adalimumab 40 mg weekly through week 56 in double-blinded fashion. The primary study outcomes were the proportion of responders who achieved clinical remission (CDAI &lt;150) at weeks 26 and 56. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of responders with a clinical response, changes from baseline in IBDQ scores, and proportion of patients in clinical remission and off corticosteroids at weeks 26 and 56. Adverse events were recorded. Patients with sustained nonresponse or experiencing a disease flare at or after week 12 were subsequently switched to open-label adalimumab treatment. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2007b</LINK> <BR/>In this study, 276 patients with Crohn's disease who were previously enrolled in the Clinical Assessment of Adalimumab Safety and Efficacy Studied as Induction Therapy for Crohn's Disease (CLASSIC I) trial, a study evaluating adalimumab for induction of remission in Crohn's disease, enrolled in the subsequent maintenance study (CLASSIC 2). All patients were naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy prior to enrolling in CLASSIC I. In the maintenance trial, patients received open-label adalimumab 40 mg at weeks 0 and 2. Patients who were in clinical remission (CDAI &lt;150) at week 0 and week 4 were then randomized to adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo to week 56. Patients who were not in remission at week 0 and 4 were enrolled in an open-label arm and received adalimumab 40 mg every other week. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in remission at week 56 in the randomized cohort of patients. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a clinical response (CDAI decrease <U>&gt;</U> 70 or <U>&gt;</U> 100) at weeks 24 and 56, changes from baseline in IBDQ scores, and the proportion of patients in remission who discontinued steroids at week 24 and 56.

<BR/>In this multicenter trial, 668 patients with active Crohn's disease (CDAI 220 to 450) underwent open-label induction with certolizumab 400 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, and 4. Patients that responded to certolizumab induction (428/668 [64%]) were then randomized to either certolizumab 400 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks through week 24, with follow up to week 26. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a clinical response (CDAI decrease <U>&gt;</U>100 from baseline) at week 26 in patients with a baseline CRP &gt; 10 mg/L. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a clinical response and clinical remission (CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150) at week 26 (irrespective of CRP levels) and changes from baseline in IBDQ scores.

<P>It was decided to not combine the data from trials involving different anti TNF-&#945; agents statistically because of differences in drug administration, patient demographics, definitions of disease activity, and differences in clinical endpoints and study durations. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK>) evaluating infliximab were grouped together for data analysis for clinical remission due to similarities in definition of remission, duration of therapy, and similar response rates in the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups. The study evaluating infliximab in patients with fistulizing disease (<LINK REF="STD-Sands-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2004</LINK>) was evaluated separately. The two studies evaluating adalimumab were evaluated separately due to heterogeneity among the participants in the two trials; namely, that participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2007b</LINK> trial were TNF-&#945; naive prior to enrolling in CLASSIC I and were in clinical remission at the time of study entry. Two studies evaluating CDP571 were grouped together for data analysis due to similarities in study design and study endpoints (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2004</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2006</LINK>) was analyzed separately because all study participants were in corticosteroid-induced clinical remission at the time of study enrollment. There were insufficient data to perform subgroup analysis according to disease extent or location. There was not consistent recording of adverse events between studies, so adverse event data was not pooled for analysis. Mean IBDQ scores and standard deviations were not consistently reported, thus this secondary outcome measure was not pooled for analysis. <B>

<BR/>INFLIXIMAB VERSUS PLACEBO</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>
<BR/>At week 44, 21/34 (62%) of infliximab-treated patients maintained a clinical response compared with 13/35 (37%) of placebo-treated patients (P = 0.16). Clinical remission rates were not reported in the article, and additional information was obtained from the authors. The proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 44 were 18/34 (52.9%) with infliximab and 7/35 (20%) with placebo (P = 0.013). Median IBDQ scores were higher in the infliximab group than placebo, but it is not clear if these were statistically significant differences. Twenty-seven percent (10/37) of patients receiving infliximab discontinued treatment, compared to 39% (14/36) of patients receiving placebo. Adverse events were similar in the infliximab and placebo groups (94.6% versus 97.2%). The incidence of serious adverse events were not specifically reported. The most common adverse events included upper respiratory tract infection, headache, abdominal pain, dyspnea, nausea, and fever. One patient who received a single dose of infliximab 10 mg/kg developed a B-cell lymphoma 9 1/2 months after the initial infusion. One case of suspected lupus was reported. No tuberculosis or opportunistic infections were reported. Antibodies to infliximab were detected in 7/47 in whom antibodies could be evaluated. <B> <BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK>
<BR/>There were 335 responders to infliximab that were randomized to one of the three treatment arms. The median time to loss of response was 38 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 15 to &gt; 54) and &gt; 54 weeks (IQR 21 to &gt; 54) in the infliximab 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, respectively. The median time to loss of response was 19 weeks (IQR 10 to 45) in the placebo arm (P = 0.002 versus infliximab 5 mg/kg; P = 0.0002 versus infliximab 10 mg/kg). The proportion of patients in remission at week 30 was 44/113 (39%) for infliximab 5 mg/kg, 50/112 (45%) for infliximab 10 mg/kg, and 23/110 (21%) for placebo (P = 0.003 versus infliximab 5 mg/kg; P = 0.0002 versus infliximab 10 mg/kg). Clinical remission rates at week 54 were obtained from the authors. These were significantly higher in the infliximab groups than placebo (32/113 [28.3%; P = 0.007] for infliximab 5 mg/kg, 43/112 [38.4%; P &lt; 0.001] for infliximab 10 mg/kg, and 15/110 [13.6%] for placebo). Clinical response rates were also significantly higher in patients receiving infliximab than placebo. Patients in the combined infliximab arms were more likely to be in steroid-free remission than patients in the placebo arm at week 54 (32/225 [29%] versus 5/110 [9%]; OR 4.2; 95%CI 1.5 to 11.5). IBDQ scores were significantly higher in patients receiving infliximab than placebo (P = 0.015 versus infliximab 5 mg/kg; P &lt; 0.0001 versus infliximab 10 mg/kg at week 54). Differences between infliximab 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg in rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and IBDQ scores were not statistically significant. Twenty-two percent (124/573) of all patients (including responders and non-responders) discontinued maintenance study treatment by week 54, but data specifically evaluating the week 2 clinical responders were unavailable. Adverse events were similar in the infliximab and placebo groups. Serious adverse events, including serious infections, were not significantly different between the infliximab and placebo groups (infliximab 5 mg/kg 28%, infliximab 10 mg/kg 22%, placebo 29%). Infusion reactions developed in a higher proportion of patients receiving infliximab (infliximab 5 mg/kg 23%, infliximab 10 mg/kg 19%, placebo 9%). One patient who crossed over to episodic infliximab 15 mg/kg developed tuberculosis at week 18. Six cases of malignancy were reported, including a natural-killer-cell lymphoma in a placebo group patient, which developed approximately 13 months after receiving the open-label infliximab infusion. Antibodies to infliximab developed in 14% of study patients: 28% in the placebo group, 9% in the infliximab 5 mg/kg group, and 6% in the infliximab 10 mg/kg group. </P>

<BR/>In this study, 195/282 patients (68%) with fistulizing Crohn's disease responded to an infliximab induction regimen (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, and 6). Patients were then randomly assigned to either infliximab 5 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every 8 weeks. The time to loss of response (defined as recrudescence of draining fistulas or a change in therapy due to persistent or worsening luminal disease) was longer for patients in the infliximab arm compared with patients receiving placebo (more than 40 weeks versus 14 weeks, P &lt; 0.001). At week 54, 33/91 (36%) of patients in the infliximab group had complete absence of draining fistulas, compared with 19/98 (19%) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.009). There were 64 patients who had a baseline CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 220 at the time of study enrollment. In those patients, clinical response was maintained in 12/33 (36%) of the infliximab group and 2/31 (6%) in the placebo group (P = 0.004) at week 54. Clinical remission rates in patients with a baseline CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 220 at study enrollment were not published, but data obtained from the authors found remission rates of 12/33 (36%) in the infliximab group and 5/31 (16%) in the placebo group at week 30 (P = 0.091) and 9/33 (27%) in the infliximab group and 1/31 (3%) in the placebo group at week 54 (P = 0.013) in subjects who had a baseline CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 220 at study enrollment. Given the differences in this study population and the other two trials, these data were not included in the pooled results. There was a significant increase in IBDQ scores at weeks 30 and 54 in the group receiving infliximab compared with placebo (P = 0.002 at week 30; P = 0.03 at week 54). Twenty-nine percent (28/96) of patients receiving infliximab and 51% (50/99) of patients receiving placebo crossed over to open-label infliximab prior to week 54. One patient in the infliximab group required surgery and one patient in the placebo group discontinued study drug because of lack of efficacy. Similar rates of adverse events (89% infliximab versus 92% placebo) and serious adverse events (14% infliximab versus 23% placebo) were reported in the infliximab and placebo groups. The incidence of serious infections was also similar between the two groups (3% infliximab versus 6% placebo). Two opportunistic infections, including one case of cytomegalovirus infection and one case of cutaneous nocardia infection, were reported during infliximab induction. No cases of tuberculosis were reported. Multiple sclerosis developed in one patient one month after receiving infliximab, and two cases of rectal carcinoma were reported during long-term follow-up. No cases of lymphoma were reported. Antibodies to infliximab developed in 17% of study patients and antibody status was inconclusive in 52% of patients. </P>
<P>Infliximab: Pooled Results<BR/>Infliximab was found to be superior to placebo for the maintenance of remission (RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.80; P &lt; 0.0001) and clinical response (RR 2.19; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.75; P = 0.005; random effects model) in Crohn's disease. Infliximab was also superior to placebo for corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 3.13; 95% CI 1.25 to 7.81; P = 0.01) and complete healing of perianal and enterocutaneous fistulas (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.04; P = 0.01) to week 54. </P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 58% (499/854) patients responded to open-label adalimumab induction therapy. In the randomized maintenance phase of the trial the proportion of responders who entered clinical remission with adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg weekly was significantly higher than placebo at week 26 (40% [68/172] for adalimumab every other week and 47% [73/157] for adalimumab weekly versus 17% [29/170] for placebo; P &lt; 0.001) and week 56 (36% [62/172] for adalimumab every other week and 41% [65/157] for adalimumab weekly versus 12% [20/170] for placebo; P &lt; 0.001). When both adalimumab groups were combined, adalimumab was found to be superior to placebo for maintenance of clinical remission to week 54 (RR 3.28; 95% CI 2.13 to 5.06). Response rates (CDAI decrease <U>&gt;</U> 70 and <U>&gt;</U> 100) were also higher in the adalimumab groups compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). IBDQ scores were higher in adalimumab-treated patients compared with placebo, but it is unclear from published reports whether these were significant differences. Adalimumab-treated patients had higher rates of steroid-free remission than placebo-treated patients at week 26 (P &lt; 0.001 for both adalimumab groups) and week 56 (6% placebo, versus 29% adalimumab every other week [P &lt; 0.001], and 23% adalimumab weekly [P = 0.008]. When both adalimumab groups were combined, adalimumab was found to be superior to placebo for maintenance of steroid-free remission to week 54 (RR 4.25; 95% CI 1.57 to 11.47). Fifty-two percent (170/329) of patients receiving adalimumab discontinued therapy before week 56, compared with 81% (138/170) of patients receiving placebo. Adverse events were reported at similar frequencies in the adalimumab and placebo groups (88.8% adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 85.6% adalimumab 40 mg every week, 84.7% placebo). The most commonly reported adverse events included arthralgias, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, and upper respiratory infections. Serious adverse events were higher in the placebo group (9.2% adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 8.2% adalimumab 40 mg every week, 15.3% placebo; P &lt; 0.05). Serious infections were reported at similar frequencies in the adalimumab and placebo groups. Two patients receiving open-label adalimumab developed tuberculosis. No other opportunistic infections were reported. One malignancy (breast cancer) was reported in the placebo group 77 days after starting open-label induction with adalimumab. One case of multiple sclerosis was reported during open-label induction. Neither antibodies to adalimumab nor serum adalimumab concentrations were measured in this study. </P>

<BR/>Study patients received open-label adalimumab 40 mg at week 0 and 2 in the maintenance study. A total of 55 patients were in remission at both week 0 and 4, and were then randomized to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, adalimumab 40 mg weekly, or placebo through 56 weeks. An additional 276 patients who were not in remission at both week 0 and 4 received open-label adalimumab maintenance, and were not included in this review. In the randomized group, patients receiving adalimumab were more likely to be in clinical remission at week 56 (adalimumab 40 mg every other week 79% [15/19], adalimumab 40 mg weekly 83% [15/18], placebo 44% [8/18]; P &lt; 0.05 for both adalimumab groups). When both adalimumab groups were combined, adalimumab was found to be superior to placebo for maintenance of clinical remission to week 54 (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.13). Clinical response (CDAI decrease <U>&gt;</U> 100) was higher in the adalimumab group compared with placebo. There was also a trend toward higher response rates when using CDAI decrease <U>&gt;</U> 70 points, but the difference was not clinically significant. The absolute numbers of patients with a clinical response were not reported. Mean IBDQ scores were higher in patients receiving adalimumab compared with placebo, but it is unclear whether these were significant differences. Adalimumab-treated patients had higher rates of steroid-free remission at week 56 (adalimumab 40 mg every other week 67% [4/6], adalimumab 40 mg weekly 88% [7/8], placebo 57% [4/7]; P-value not reported). When both adalimumab groups were combined, there was no statistically significant difference in steroid sparing between adalimumab and placebo to week 54 (RR 1.38; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.76). Thirty percent (11/37) of patients receiving adalimumab discontinued double-blind treatment prior to week 56, compared with 67% (12/18) of patients receiving placebo. A greater proportion of patients in the placebo group experienced adverse events; the most commonly reported events were nasopharyngitis, worsening Crohn's disease, and sinusitis. Serious adverse events were higher in the placebo group (adalimumab 40 mg every other week 5% [1/19], adalimumab 40 mg weekly 0% [0/18], placebo 11% [2/18]). One malignancy (squamous cell carcinoma involving the head) was reported in the placebo group [Abbott Laboratories, personal communication]. A total of 2.6% of patients in both the randomized and open-label groups developed antibodies to adalimumab during the study. </P>

<BR/>In this study, 428 patients had a clinical response (CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 100 from baseline) to certolizumab pegol induction and were randomized to certolizumab 400 mg or placebo maintenance every 4 weeks to week 26. At week 26, a significantly higher proportion of patients were in clinical remission with certolizumab than with placebo (certolizumab 103/215 [48%] versus placebo 60/210 [29%]; P &lt; 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients maintained a clinical response with certolizumab through week 26 (135/215 [63%]) compared with placebo (76/210 [36%]; P &lt; 0.001). Similar clinical response rates were found in patients with elevated CRP levels at week 26 (certolizumab 69/112 [62%] versus placebo 34/101 [34%]; P &lt; 0.001). Adjusted mean IBDQ scores were significantly higher in the certolizumab group at week 26 (certolizumab 171 versus placebo 163; P = 0.007). The proportion of patients in steroid-free remission was not reported. Thirty percent (65/216) of patients receiving certolizumab pegol discontinued treatment prior to week 26, compared to 49% (103/212) of patients receiving placebo. Adverse events were reported in similar frequencies in the certolizumab and placebo maintenance groups (certolizumab 65% versus placebo 67%); the most commonly reported events were headache, nasopharyngitis, cough, Crohn's exacerbation, and pain at injection site. Serious adverse events were reported in 12/216 (6%) of certolizumab patients and 14/212 (7%) of placebo patients. One patient receiving certolizumab developed pulmonary tuberculosis. No malignancies were reported. A total of 9% (58/668) of patients developed detectable antibodies to certolizumab during the study. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2001a</LINK>
<BR/>The rates of clinical remission for CDP571 were not significantly different than placebo at any study visit. The rate of clinical remission at week 24 were 4% for placebo and 11% for CDP571 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks, and 3% for placebo and 11% for CDP571 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks. A significant clinical response to CDP571 (CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 70) was noted at week 2, but not at subsequent study visits. There was no difference in the median IBDQ scores at any study visit. Sixty eight percent (75/111) of patients in the CDP571 group withdrew prior to study completion, compared to 81% (47/58) of patients in the placebo group. The overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the CDP571 group (87% CDP571 versus 69% placebo), but the incidence of serious adverse events was not significantly different. The most common side effects included headache, abdominal pain, and nausea. The incidence of infection was similar in the two groups. No cases of opportunistic infection or malignancy were reported. Antibodies to CDP571 were found in 7% of patients. Infusion reactions occurred in 12% of patients in the CDP571 group and 7% in the placebo group (P = .42). </P>

The proportion of patients with a clinical response (decrease in CDAI score <U>&gt;</U> 100 points or remission) at week 28 was 30.4% (80/263) in the CDP571 group and 23.5% (31/132) in the placebo group (P = 0.10). There was no significant difference in clinical remission rates (CDP571 23.6% versus placebo 20.5%). There were no significant differences in mean IBDQ scores. Fewer patients in the CDP571 group withdrew prior to study completion (CDP 571 43% versus placebo 57%).The two treatment groups had similar incidences of total (CDP571 72.2% versus placebo 76%) and serious (CDP571 13.5% versus placebo 10.3%) adverse events. Infusion reactions occurred more frequently in the CDP571 group (20.5% versus 10.5%; P value not reported). No cases of opportunistic infections or malignancy were reported.

<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2006</LINK>
<BR/>A total of 269 patients (181 treatment, 88 placebo) with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease were enrolled and followed until week 36. All patients were in remission (CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150) at the time of study enrollment. There were no differences in steroid withdrawal between patients treated with CDP571 (53/181, 29.3%) and placebo (33/90, 36.7%; P = 0.24). There were no significant differences in steroid-sparing at week 16, 24, and 32, and no differences in IBDQ scores between patients treated with CDP571 and placebo.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>While corticosteroids are effective in the induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's, over 50% of patients become steroid-dependent or undergo surgical resection within 1 year of commencing therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Faubion-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faubion 2001</LINK>). Immunosuppressives can reduce corticosteroid dependency and maintain disease remission, but have not been shown to reduce the need for surgery or the development of other complications of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Cosnes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosnes 2005</LINK>). It is important to consider alternative treatment options in this setting. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-van-Deventer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Deventer 2001</LINK>). Biologic agents active against TNF-&#945; have been investigated in clinical trials and have been found to be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Nine randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of anti-TNF-&#945; therapy for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease were evaluated. Six trials examined anti TNF-&#945; agents in patients with Crohn's disease with a clinical response or remission to induction therapy; 3 evaluating infliximab, 2 evaluating adalimumab, and 1 evaluating certolizumab. Two trials involving CDP571 did not select for patients with a clinical response to induction therapy. One trial evaluated the corticosteroid-sparing effects of CDP571 in patients in clinical remission on corticosteroid therapy. Infliximab was found to be superior to placebo for maintenance of remission (RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.80), clinical response (RR 2.19; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.75), corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 3.13; 95% CI 1.25 to 7.81), and complete fistula healing (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.04) to week 54. Adalimumab was found to be superior to placebo for maintenance of clinical remission, and clinical response to week 54. Although no significant corticosteroid sparing effects were found in the <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2007b</LINK> study, the results from the larger <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK> study suggest that adalimumab is superior to placebo for corticosteroid sparing (RR 4.25; 95% CI 1.57 to 11.47). Certolizumab pegol was found to be superior to placebo for maintenance of remission (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.16) and clinical response (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.13) to week 26. CDP571 was not found to be effective for maintenance of remission or corticosteroid sparing in Crohn's disease. </P>
<P>In the studies that assessed variable doses, no significant differences in clinical efficacy were noted when comparing infliximab 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK>), or comparing adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK>). While comparative trials evaluating different anti-TNF-&#945; agents have not been performed, clinical remission rates appear to be similar among infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab when assessed at similar time points. Taking the largest trials into account, remission rates were 41.8% at week 30 with infliximab (<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2002</LINK>), 42.9% at week 26 with adalimumab (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK>), and 48% at week 26 with certolizumab (<LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2007</LINK>). There also appears to be similar response rates with respect to fistula closure; rates of complete fistula closure were similar for infliximab (36% [33/91])(<LINK REF="STD-Sands-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2004</LINK>) and adalimumab (33% [23/70]) (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2007</LINK>) at week 54. Fistula closure with certolizumab pegol at week 26 was not reported in the paper, but complete fistula closure at any time during the study was 54% (15/28) with certolizumab and 43% (13/30) with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2007</LINK>). Although differences in trial durations limit direct comparisons of all data, it appears likely that infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol have similar clinical efficacy in patients with Crohn's disease. </P>
<P>Adverse events were observed in approximately equal frequencies in the treatment and placebo groups in the included studies. It should be noted that serious adverse events, including tuberculosis and lymphoma, were reported in several trials. The trial durations and size were insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of the risk of serious adverse events associated with long-term anti-TNF-&#945; therapy. In addition, patients in the placebo arms frequently received open-label anti-TNF-&#945; therapy for induction or crossed over to open-label therapy later in the study, making it difficult to accurately compare the risk between the treatment and placebo groups. The overall serious infection rates in the treatment groups were reported to be 2.8% to 4% overall and did not differ significantly from placebo. Further data has been obtained from observational studies, including the Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation and Assessment Tool (TREAT) registry. While observational data has limitations, it can provide valuable long-term information not obtained from randomized controlled trials. Recent data from the TREAT registry has found no increased risk of serious infections with infliximab after adjusting for disease severity and corticosteroid use (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.54; <LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2006</LINK>). However, there is less consensus regarding the risk of malignancy with long-term anti-TNF-&#945; therapy in Crohn's disease. A systematic review evaluating the results of placebo-controlled trials of anti-TNF-&#945; agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis found an increased risk of malignancy with anti-TNF-&#945; therapy (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Bongartz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bongartz 2006</LINK>). However, this review has been criticized for failing to adjust for differences in duration of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Okada-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okada 2006</LINK>) and potential bias (<LINK REF="REF-Callegari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callegari 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoor 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corona-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corona 2007</LINK>). Data from the TREAT registry has not shown a significant increase of malignancy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2007</LINK>). Given available data, a link between anti-TNF-&#945; therapy and malignancy in patients with Crohn's disease remains unclear. </P>
<P>In conclusion, scheduled therapy with the anti-TNF-&#945; agents infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol is effective for maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease who have a clinical response to induction therapy. Infliximab and adalimumab have been shown to have corticosteroid-sparing effects. Infliximab has been shown to maintain complete fistula healing. CDP571 is not effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. The rates of adverse events are similar in the included studies, but the precise risk of serious adverse events associated with anti-TNF-&#945; therapy in Crohn's disease remains to be defined. The efficacy of anti-TNF-&#945; therapy in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease should be investigated in future reviews.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol are effective for maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease who have a clinical response to induction therapy. Infliximab is effective for maintenance of fistula closure in patients with perianal or enterocutaneous fistulizing disease who have a clinical response to induction therapy. Infliximab and adalimumab are currently approved for use in Crohn's disease in many countries (including the USA, Canada and the European Union), while certolizumab pegol remains under review by regulatory agencies. Adverse events are observed in approximately equal frequencies in the treatment and placebo groups in the included studies, but the follow up duration of these trials is generally too short to allow an adequate assessment of the long-term adverse events associated with anti-TNF-&#945; therapy. There is no evidence to support the use of CDP571 for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials involving anti-TNF-&#945; therapies should have consistent study endpoints and comprehensive data collection made publicly available to allow more accurate comparisons between trials. Comprehensive data on anti-TNF-&#945; therapy in pediatric and pregnant patients should be obtained. Direct comparative trials assessing different biologic agents should be pursued. Further data on long-term clinical response and remission rates, long-term safety, and data on the impact of anti-TNF-&#945; therapy on hospitalizations and surgeries should be obtained. The impact of concomitant immunosuppressive use on clinical efficacy and safety endpoints should be further defined. The role of anti-TNF-&#945; agents early in the course of Crohn's disease, and whether this strategy may change the natural history of disease, should continue to be evaluated. </P>
