<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Included trials:</P>
<P>We included four new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Girault-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabie-Agmy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rabie Agmy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawfeek-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tawfeek 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaschetto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Vaschetto 2012</LINK>) in this updated review. For one trial with three arms, we included two arms relevant to our research question (<LINK REF="STD-Girault-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality assessment:</P>
<P>In this update, we evaluated and recorded the presence of true randomization and the use of concealed allocation to minimize selection bias. Additionally, we evaluated reports of randomized trials for completeness of outcome data and selective outcomes reported to assess for attrition and reporting biases, respectively.</P>
<P>Unlike in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2010</LINK>), we did not include in our quality assessment the use of daily screening to identify participants capable of unassisted breathing; predefined, permissive weaning criteria to identify weaning candidates (including but not limited to minute ventilation, tidal volume (V<SUB>T</SUB>), vital capacity, respiratory rate, rapid shallow breathing index, Glasgow Coma Scale, presence of spontaneous ventilatory efforts and a cough reflex, requirement for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ability to maintain arterial oxygen saturation above 90% on a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) of less than 0.50) and performace of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). We did not include assessment of the use of weaning protocols or guidelines (in both groups) and criteria for failure of a prerandomization SBT, discontinuation of mechanical ventilation (in both groups) and extubation, reintubation due to poor reporting of these aspects of trial design and implementation and concerns over the reliability of efforts to acquire these details amidst language issues. We contacted authors to ask them to describe specific features of their trials including use of daily screening and a prerandomization SBT; however, we did not include these items in the quality assessment in this update.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria:</P>
<P>We updated our exclusion criteria to exclude studies evaluating exclusively tracheostomized participants as (1) tracheostomy was an outcome of this review, (2) these studies typically include a high proportion of participants undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation and (3) application of the interventions could be different in the setting of a tracheostomy (e.g. participants randomly assigned to noninvasive weaning may meet criteria to return to invasive ventilation per tracheostomy and subsequently be returned to noninvasive ventilation. Similarly, participants randomly assigned to invasive weaning may undergo a series of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) before extubation).</P>
<P>Summary of findings:</P>
<P>We included in this update SoF tables for the outcomes of mortality, weaning failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and reintubation .</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We invited one new review author (Sean Keenan) to participate in the update to the previously published meta-analysis (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/#REF-Burns-2003">Burns 2003</A>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Study assessment and outcomes reporting, methodology assessment: in assessing methodologic quality, we assessed whether trials included discontinuation OR extubation criteria in both treatment arms in order to limit performance bias as trials infrequently reported extubation criteria as part of the weaning strategy separate from initial extubation criteria.</LI>
<LI>In this update, we were able to pool three adverse events (reintubation, tracheostomy and arrhthymias) reported in a small number of studies.</LI>
<LI>New findings: despite identification of new evidence, our conclusion remains unchanged. Similar to our previous findings, compared to invasive weaning, we found that noninvasive weaning significantly decreased mortality, ventilator associated pneumonia, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, the total duration of ventilation and duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation. Noninvasive weaning had no effect on weaning failures or the duration of ventilation related to weaning; no study reported on quality of life. Excluding a single quasi-randomised trial maintained the significant reduction in mortality and ventilator associated pneumonia. Subgroup analyses suggested that the benefits on mortality and weaning failures were non significantly greater in trials enrolling exclusively chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients versus mixed populations.</LI>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:57:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients with acute respiratory failure frequently require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (invasive positive-pressure ventilation) to sustain life. Complications of mechanical ventilation include respiratory muscle weakness, upper airway injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, sinusitis and associated death. For these reasons, it is important to minimize the duration of mechanical ventilation. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation is achieved with an oronasal, nasal or total face mask connected to a positive-pressure ventilator and does not require an indwelling artificial airway.</P>
<P>Results from 16 randomized controlled trials, predominantly of moderate to good quality, involving 994 selected participants, approximately two thirds with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had respiratory failure and were starting to breathe spontaneously, demonstrate that support with noninvasive ventilation can decrease death, weaning failure, pneumonia and length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. Noninvasive weaning also decreased the total duration of ventilation and the time spent on invasive ventilation, as well as the number of participants who received a tracheostomy. Although noninvasive weaning had no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation related to weaning, it did not increase the reintubation rate. Insufficient data were<B> </B>available to assess its impact on quality of life. Noninvasive weaning significantly reduced mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studies versus mixed population studies.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-12-04 13:02:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We evaluated studies in which invasively ventilated adults with respiratory failure of any cause (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-COPD, postoperative, nonoperative) were weaned by means of early extubation followed by immediate application of NPPV or continued IPPV weaning. The primary objective was to determine whether the noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) strategy reduced all-cause mortality compared with invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) weaning. Secondary objectives were to ascertain differences between strategies in proportions of weaning failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), total duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical support related to weaning, duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (ETMV), frequency of adverse events (related to weaning) and overall quality of life. We planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses to assess (1) the influence on mortality and VAP of excluding quasi-randomized trials, and (2) effects on mortality and weaning failure associated with different causes of respiratory failure (COPD vs. mixed populations).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:48:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 16 trials, predominantly of moderate to good quality, involving 994 participants, most with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The benefits for mortality were significantly greater in trials enrolling exclusively participants with COPD (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.56) versus mixed populations (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.40). NPPV significantly reduced weaning failure (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.43); shortened length of stay in an intensive care unit (mean difference (MD) -5.59 days, 95% CI -7.90 to -3.28) and in hospital (MD -6.04 days, 95% CI -9.22 to -2.87); and decreased the total duration of ventilation (MD -5.64 days, 95% CI -9.50 to -1.77) and the duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (MD - 7.44 days, 95% CI -10.34 to -4.55) amidst significant heterogeneity. Noninvasive weaning also significantly reduced tracheostomy (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47) and reintubation (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) rates. Noninvasive weaning had no effect on the duration of ventilation related to weaning. Exclusion of a single quasi-randomized trial did not alter these results. Subgroup analyses suggest that the benefits for mortality were significantly greater in trials enrolling exclusively participants with COPD versus mixed populations.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:48:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) frequently require endotracheal intubation (ETI) and mechanical ventilation to sustain life. Although invasive ventilation is effective, it has been associated with the development of complications, including respiratory muscle weakness, upper airway pathology, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (<LINK REF="REF-Pingleton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pingleton 1988</LINK>) and sinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Niederman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niederman 1984</LINK>). VAP in turn is associated with increased morbidity and a trend toward increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1999</LINK>). For these reasons, minimizing the duration of invasive mechanical support is an important goal of critical care (<LINK REF="REF-MacIntyre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacIntyre 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:48:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) may provide a means of avoiding the need for or reducing the duration of invasive mechanical support for intubated patients with ARF. Unlike conventional invasive ventilation, NPPV is achieved with an oronasal, nasal or total face mask or a helmet connected to a ventilator and does not require an artificial airway. Through NPPV, one can (1) administer oxygen, (2) augment tidal volume and (3) apply extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (ePEEP) to counteract intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (iPEEP) (<LINK REF="REF-Appendini-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appendini 1994</LINK>). NPPV may provide partial ventilatory support to patients recovering from respiratory failure and who require ventilator support but have regained the ability to breathe spontaneously and can be extubated. NPPV has been shown to augment tidal volume, reduce breathing frequency, rest the muscles of respiration and improve gas exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Nava-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nava 1993</LINK>). A small, prospective physiologic study of participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with hypercapneic respiratory failure who were not capable of fully autonomous breathing demonstrated that although physiologic and clinical responses to the delivery of noninvasive and invasive pressure support (PS) were similar (<LINK REF="REF-Vitacca-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitacca 2001</LINK>), significantly higher tidal volumes and lower dyspnoea scores were achieved with noninvasive PS (<LINK REF="REF-Vitacca-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitacca 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>With acute exacerbation of COPD, the effectiveness of NPPV in decreasing mortality and ETI rates has been demonstrated in randomized trials and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Keenan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peter 2002</LINK>). Data to support the use of NPPV in non-COPD participants with hypoxaemic respiratory failure are inconclusive at present (<LINK REF="REF-Keenan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 2004</LINK>). Many patients with severe respiratory failure, impaired sensorium, haemodynamic instability or difficulty clearing secretions, however, undergo direct intubation or intubation after a failed attempt at noninvasive ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Keenan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-02 22:42:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>To mitigate the effects of complications associated with protracted invasive ventilation, investigators have explored the role of NPPV in weaning, that is, replacing invasive support with noninvasive support in patients who are ready to be weaned but are not ready to be immediately extubated. Because no tracheal prosthesis is used with the NPPV approach and the cough reflex is preserved, the risk for development of VAP is reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Antonelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonelli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nourdine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nourdine 1999</LINK>). Additionally, weaning with NPPV may reduce the requirement for sedation (<LINK REF="REF-Rathgeber-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathgeber 1997</LINK>), decrease psychological distress (<LINK REF="REF-Criner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criner 1994</LINK>) and preserve important functions, including speech and oral intake (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2001</LINK>). NPPV has been identified by professional organizations, including the American College of Chest Physicians, American Association for Respiratory Care and American College of Critical Care Medicine,<I> </I>as a weaning modality that may decrease the duration of intubation and improve patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Meade-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meade 2001</LINK>).

<P>The first report to describe the successful use of NPPV in liberating participants with weaning failure from invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) was published in 1992 (<LINK REF="REF-Udwadia-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udwadia 1992</LINK>). Thereafter, four uncontrolled, prospective studies were reported, in which participants with tracheostomies (<LINK REF="REF-Goodenberger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodenberger 1992</LINK>), participants with tracheostomies and translaryngeal airways (<LINK REF="REF-Restrick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Restrick 1993</LINK>) and those not meeting conventional discontinuation criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Gregoretti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregoretti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilger 1999</LINK>) were weaned using NPPV. More recently, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the alternative weaning strategies have been published. The purpose of this review was to critically appraise, summarize and update information on the effects of NPPV weaning compared with IPPV weaning on important clinical outcomes, in light of new evidence derived from RCTs.</P>

<LI>The primary objective was to determine whether the noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) strategy reduced all-cause mortality compared with invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) weaning.</LI>
<LI>Secondary objectives were to ascertain differences between strategies in proportions of weaning failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), total duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical support related to weaning, duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (ETMV), frequency of adverse events (related to weaning) and overall quality of life.</LI>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:48:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The quality of all included trials was assessed by two review authors (KEAB, NKJK), both independently and in duplicate. For each study, we recorded the use of true randomization and the use of concealed allocation to minimize selection bias. Additionally, we evaluated reports of randomized trials for completeness of outcome data and selective outcomes reporting to assess for attrition and reporting biases, respectively. The two review authors evaluated each quality assessment independently and resolved disagreements through discussion and electronic email.</P>
<P>In detail, we judged study quality on the basis of the following (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>1. Was sequence generation truly random?</P>
<P>Adequate sequence generation included reference to a random number table, use of a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling of cards or envelopes, throwing of dice, drawing of lots or minimization.</P>
<P>
<BR/>2. Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>Adequate allocation concealment included central randomization (e.g. allocation by a central office unaware of participant characteristics unless based on stratification), such as an on-site computer system combined with allocation sequence kept in a locked unreadable computer file accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant were entered; sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; or another similar approach to ensure that the person generating the allocation sequence did not administer it.<BR/>
</P>
<P>3. Were withdrawals described, and did they occur with similar frequency in intervention and control groups?</P>
<P>4. Were reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>We assigned a judgement related to the risk of bias for each domain as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>'yes' (criteria appropriately applied and described in the report or acknowledged from the primary author of the study).</LI>
<LI>'unclear' (criteria not described or impossible to acquire from the author).</LI>
<LI>'no' (criteria inappropriately applied).</LI>
</UL>
<P>A judgement of 'Yes' indicated a low risk of bias, 'No' indicated a high risk of bias and 'Unclear' indicated an unknown or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used the principles of the GRADE system (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) to assess the quality of the body of evidence in our review associated with specific outcomes (weaning time, time to successful extubation, time to first SBT and first successful SBT, mortality, total duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay and reintubation) and constructed <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; and Summary of findings table 2 (SoF tables) using the GRADE software (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The GRADE approach appraised the quality of a body of evidence based on the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the item being assessed. Assessment of the quality of a body of evidence considered within-study risk of bias (methodologic quality), directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of the effect estimates and risk of publication bias.</P>

Successful weaning was not defined in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Girault-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabie-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rabie 2004</LINK>) and was defined in two studies as not requiring initiation of NPPV or reintubation within 72 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Nava-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Nava 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawfeek-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tawfeek 2012</LINK>) or as not requiring reintubation within 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2000</LINK>). Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Girault-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 1999</LINK>) defined weaning failure as the need for reintubation by day five after extubation or, when extubation was not possible, within five days of initiation of weaning efforts in the IPPV group. In this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Girault-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 1999</LINK>), all participants with weaning failure were reintubated within five days. Successful weaning was defined as the absence of reintubation within three days after extubation (<LINK REF="STD-Tawfeek-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tawfeek 2012</LINK>) or, if reintubation or noninvasive ventilation was not required, within 72 hours of suspension of ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Rabie-Agmy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rabie Agmy 2012</LINK>). Similarly, Vaschetto et al (<LINK REF="STD-Vaschetto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Vaschetto 2012</LINK>) defined extubation failure as the inability to sustain spontaneous unassisted breathing for 48 consecutive hours without development of respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive). With moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 39%, P = 0.12), the pooled data demonstrated a significant reduction in the proportion of weaning failures with noninvasive weaning (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96, P = 0.03). Although summary estimates of effect on weaning failure suggested greater benefit in three trials evaluating participants with COPD (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.74, P = 0.0002) versus five trials involving mixed populations (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.51, P = 0.40), between-group differences were not significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.71, P = 0.40; see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; Summary of findings table 2).</P>

<P>We identified 16 trials comparing NPPV and IPPV weaning strategies among 994 participants, most with COPD. Compared with IPPV, NPPV significantly decreased mortality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), weaning failure and VAP (Summary of findings table 2). Amidst significant heterogeneity, NPPV weaning also significantly reduced ICU and hospital LOS, total duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of invasive ventilation. Although noninvasive weaning significantly reduced tracheostomy and reintubation rates, it had no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation related to weaning (Summary of findings table 2). Exclusion of a single quasi-randomized trial supported statistically significant reductions in mortality and VAP favouring NPPV. Subgroup analyses suggested that benefits of the noninvasive approach to weaning in terms of mortality were significantly greater in trials enrolling exclusively COPD participants compared with those enrolling mixed populations. Summary estimates from 16 trials of moderate to good quality, including predominantly participants with COPD, demonstrated a positive effect of noninvasive weaning on mortality and VAP without increased risk of weaning failure or reintubation.</P>

Patients with chronic airflow limitation may be ideally suited to NPPV given its ability to offset respiratory muscle fatigue and tachypnoea, augment tidal volume and reduce iPEEP. Subgroup analyses suggested greater benefit with noninvasive weaning in COPD participants, with statistical tests of subgroup effects achieving statistical significance. Notwithstanding, inferences from subgroup analyses may be limited by inclusion of COPD participants in mixed population studies and by the small number of trials comparing alternative weaning strategies in participants with respiratory failure of other causes. Whether other causes of respiratory failure are as amenable as COPD to noninvasive weaning remains to be determined in a single, adequately powered RCT.</P>
<P>This review was strengthened by an extensive search for relevant trials. We screened citations and abstracted data independently and in duplicate, and we corresponded with investigators to clarify study methods and outcomes reporting, when needed. Pooling of results in a meta-analysis implicitly assumes that the included studies are sufficiently similar with respect to populations, study interventions, outcomes and methodologic quality that one could reasonably expect a comparable underlying treatment effect. To this end, we exclusively used random-effects models for pooling data, which take into consideration both between-study and within-study variation.

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:48:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Studies included in this meta-analysis varied in the methods used to identify weaning candidates and to titrate and discontinue mechanical support. Multidisciplinary protocols used to identify weaning candidates and to perform daily SBTs reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Ely-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ely 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ely-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ely 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kollef-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollef 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marelich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marelich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perren 2002</LINK>). For patients failing an SBT, PS or intermittent or once-daily SBTs are favoured over SIMV to facilitate discontinuation of support (<LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Butler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jounieaux-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jounieaux 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomlinson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomlinson 1989</LINK>). Although criteria used to identify candidates for an SBT or for weaning were used in 11 trials, only three trials screened daily for SBT readiness. In addition, four trials each conducted prerandomization SBTs and assessed for resolution of pulmonary infection to identify weaning readiness. The latter strategy represents a novel approach to identifying weaning candidates in selected populations and prioritizes identifying the cause of respiratory failure (bronchopulmonary infection) over meeting conventional weaning criteria. Methods for identifying weaning candidates may have an impact on study estimates of the duration of ventilation; however, these prerandomization study design considerations are less likely to result in important performance bias. Conversely, unequal or inconsistent use of weaning protocols and the frequency with which periods of spontaneous breathing (noninvasive strategy) or SBTs (invasive strategy) were permitted were variably reported among the included trials and represent important postrandomization study design considerations that could bias estimates of the duration of ventilation in unblinded weaning trials. Trials also varied in their selection and reporting of outcomes. An additional important study design consideration for weaning trials that could have an impact on the duration of ventilation is sedation administration (<LINK REF="REF-Brook-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1999</LINK>). Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2000</LINK>) in our review used a sedation protocol. Overall, most trials in this review were of moderate quality; three trials were evaluated to be at low risk of bias and two trials were considered to be at high risk of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-26 22:24:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In summary estimates, we found that noninvasive weaning significantly reduced mortality, ICU and hospital LOS and total duration of mechanical ventilation; these findings are consistent with and may be due to reduced VAP. However, we cannot ignore the fact that having direct access to respiratory secretions in invasively weaned participants may have resulted in detection bias by enhancing VAP detection in this group compared with the noninvasively weaned group. Inspection of control group rates of VAP in our review shows that they varied widely, ranging from 6.3% (<LINK REF="STD-Girault-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 1999</LINK>) to 59.1% (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrer 2003</LINK>). Similarly, control group mortality rates in our review ranged from 11.1% (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabie-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rabie 2004</LINK>) to 60.0% (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2009</LINK>). Across trials, 173 total mortality events and 174 total VAP events were reported. Disparate control group mortality and VAP event rates, potential for detection bias in assessment of VAP, total of less than several hundred mortality VAP events (<LINK REF="REF-Devereaux-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereaux 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>) and selection and reporting of continuous outcomes limit the strength of inferences that can be made from this review. In addition, although estimates of the impact of heterogeneity associated with pooled estimates of mortality, VAP and reintubation were considered moderate, estimates associated with most continuous outcomes (ICU and hospital LOS, total duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of endotracheal mechanical intubation) were considerable. To this end, we considered estimates of the impact of heterogeneity to be unimportant (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) for only two outcomes (arrhythmia and tracheostomy rates), which significantly favoured noninvasive weaning. Finally, we noted effect modification with NPPV weaning in subgroup analysis of mortality but not for other outcomes. This finding may reflect differences in the populations studied,physiological benefitsof NPPV in COPD participants, ecological bias (findings at the trial level driven by some other differences between trials, such as quality, that may not be confirmed by a within-trial subgroup analysis), lack of robustness of the mortality subgroup analysis or lack of power in the other subgroup analyses conducted.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-04 12:48:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In their efforts to optimize the time of liberation from invasive ventilation, clinicians are challenged by a trade-off between the risks associated with failed extubation and the complications associated with prolonged invasive ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1997</LINK>). Noninvasive weaning, by providing ventilatory support without an artificial airway, offers a potential solution to this trade-off. Summary estimates from 16 trials of moderate to good quality, most with COPD participants, demonstrated a positive effect of NPPV weaning on mortality and VAP without increased risk of weaning failure or reintubation.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these data, clinicians may be reluctant to incorporate noninvasive weaning into clinical practice because of the need to surrender a protected airway, concerns regarding the ventilatory support that can be provided with NPPV and increased risk for developing VAP if reintubation is required (<LINK REF="REF-Pawar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawar 2003</LINK>). Promising findings associated with noninvasive weaning require confirmation in a single, large, adequately powered RCT. The optimal timing for transitioning patients to NPPV for weaning remains to be determined. Additionally, whether other causes of respiratory failure are as amenable as COPD to noninvasive weaning remains to be elucidated.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-26 22:26:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Current trials of noninvasive weaning, mainly small trials most with COPD, show near-consistent positive effects on mortality and VAP without increased risk of weaning failure and reintubation. Although use of NPPV to wean participants with COPD is associated with highly encouraging net clinical benefit (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (to prevent death) of 8.9 in all participants and 6.5 in the COPD subgroup), most evidence has been obtained from small randomized trials. Given the potential for small event rates to be misleading when results from multiple small RCTs are pooled, additional evidence is required from a large, adequately powered RCT before we can recommend the routine use of NPPV as an adjunct for weaning patients from invasive mechanical ventilation. If consideration is given to adopting this approach to wean patients, we suggest that it be preferentially used in patients with COPD and in highly monitored environments at expert centres.<BR/>

<P>In the previously published protocol, as part of an a priori sensitivity analysis, we stated that we would assess the impact of the cause of respiratory failure (COPD vs non-COPD) on (1) the proportion of weaning failures and (2) mortality. In the last version of this review, we identified two studies restricted to participants with COPD and three studies with mixed participant populations. In the absence of individual participant data, we compared studies restricted to COPD participants versus those with mixed participant populations. To explore for potential differences in response to NPPV, we compared studies enrolling at least 50% COPD participants versus those enrolling less than 50% COPD participants, in terms of mortality.</P>
<P>To search EMBASE, we used the following Emtree terms: respiratory failure (explode), positive end-expiratory pressure (explode) and weaning (explode). In addition, we used the Emtag: artificial ventilation.</P>
<P>In the protocol, we stated that the MEDLINE search strategy would be limited to include the following publication types: clinical trials, controlled clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, multicenter studies and meta-analyses.

<U>Quality assessment</U>
</P>
<P>In this update, we evaluated and recorded the presence of true randomization and use of concealed allocation to minimize selection bias. Additionally, we evaluated reports of randomized trials for completeness of outcome data and selective outcomes reporting to assess for attrition and reporting biases, respectively.</P>
<P>Unlike in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2010</LINK>), we did not include in our quality assessment the use of daily screening to identify participants capable of unassisted breathing; inclusion of predefined, permissive weaning criteria to identify weaning candidates (including but not limited to minute ventilation, tidal volume (V<SUB>T</SUB>), vital capacity, respiratory rate, rapid shallow breathing index, Glasgow Coma Scale, presence of spontaneous ventilatory efforts and a cough reflex, requirement for PEEP and ability to maintain arterial oxygen saturation above 90% on a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) of less than 0.50) and performance of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). We did not include assessment of the use of weaning protocols or guidelines (in both groups) and criteria for failure of prerandomization SBT, discontinuation of mechanical ventilation (in both groups) and extubation, reintubation due to poor reporting of these aspects of trial design and implementation and concerns over the reliability of efforts to acquire these details amidst language issues. We contacted study authors to ask them to describe specific features of their trials, including use of daily screening and a prerandomization SBT; however, we did not include them in the quality assessment in this update.</P>

<U>Exclusion criteria</U>
</P>
<P>We updated our exclusion criteria to exclude studies evaluating exclusively tracheostomized participants, as (1) tracheostomy was an outcome of this review, (2) these studies typically include a high proportion of participants undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation and (3) application of the interventions could be different in the setting of a tracheostomy (e.g. participants randomly assigned to noninvasive weaning may meet criteria to return to invasive ventilation per tracheostomy and subsequently may be returned to noninvasive ventilation. Similarly, participants randomly assigned to invasive weaning may undergo a series of SBTs before extubation).</P>

<P>After intubation, participants were ventilated in controlled mode, received sedation and paralysis for the first six to eight hours and were treated with PS for an additional 60 hours. A T-piece trial was carried out once participants achieved a satisfactory neurological status and normal temperature and were haemodynamically stable.

We excluded this trial because (1) tracheostomy was an outcome of our review, (2) this study included a high proportion of participants undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation and (3) interventions were applied in a different manner in the setting of a tracheostomy. For example, participants randomly assigned to noninvasive weaning could have met criteria to return to invasive ventilation per tracheostomy and subsequently could have been returned to noninvasive ventilation. Similarly, participants randomly assigned to invasive weaning could have undergone a series of SBTs before extubation</P>
