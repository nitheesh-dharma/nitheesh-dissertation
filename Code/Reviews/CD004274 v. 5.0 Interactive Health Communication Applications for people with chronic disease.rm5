<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:03:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>People with chronic disease have multiple needs, including information about their illness and the various treatment options; social support; support with making decisions; and help with achieving behaviour change, for example, changes in diet or exercise. Computer-based programmes which combine health information with online peer support, decision support, or help with behaviour change may be one way of meeting these needs, and of helping people to achieve better health. This review sought to find out how such computer programmes, known as Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs), might affect people with chronic disease. The review authors found that IHCAs improved users' knowledge, social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes. It is also more likely than not that IHCAs improve users' self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action). It was not possible to determine whether IHCAs had any effect on emotional and economic outcomes. The included studies involved different IHCAs, with different characteristics, for a wide range of chronic diseases. There was variability in several of the outcomes, and the results should therefore be treated with some caution. There is a need for more large, high quality studies to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:03:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, information packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. These are innovations in health care and their effects on health are uncertain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of IHCAs for people with chronic disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We designed a four-part search strategy. First, we searched electronic bibliographic databases for published work; second, we searched the grey literature; and third, we searched for ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the appropriate databases. Finally, researchers of included studies were contacted, and reference lists from relevant primary and review articles were followed up. As IHCAs require relatively new technology, the search time period commenced at 1990, where possible, and ran until 31 December 2003.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IHCAs for adults and children with chronic disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:03:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>One review author screened abstracts for relevance. Two review authors screened all candidate studies to determine eligibility, apply quality criteria, and extract data from included studies. Authors of included RCTs were contacted for missing data. Results of RCTs were pooled using random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes; heterogeneity was assessed using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-17 15:55:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We identified 24 RCTs involving 3739 participants which were included in the review.</P>
<P>IHCAs had a significant positive effect on knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69), social support (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.52) and clinical outcomes (SMD 0.18; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35). Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.48). IHCAs had a significant positive effect on continuous behavioural outcomes (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.40). Binary behavioural outcomes also showed a positive effect for IHCAs, although this result was not statistically significant (OR 1.66; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.87). It was not possible to determine the effects of IHCAs on emotional or economic outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>IHCAs appear to have largely positive effects on users, in that users tend to become more knowledgeable, feel better socially supported, and may have improved behavioural and clinical outcomes compared to non-users. There is a need for more high quality studies with large sample sizes to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-23 12:24:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-23 12:20:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. To date, the major conceptual thinking in this area has been undertaken in the USA by the Science Panel on Interactive Communication and Health (<LINK REF="REF-SciPICH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">SciPICH 1998</LINK>), which convened in 1998. This panel defined the terms Interactive Health Communications and Interactive Health Communication Applications as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Definitions</HEADING>
<P>Interactive Health Communication (IHC): the interaction of an individual - consumer, patient, caregiver, or professional - with or through an electronic device or communication technology to access or transmit health information or receive guidance and support on a health-related issue. Using this definition, IHC encompasses technology-mediated health communication and does not include direct communication such as face-to-face clinician-patient counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Eng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs): the operational software programmes or modules that interface with the end user. This includes health information and support web sites and clinical decision-support and risk assessment software (which may or may not be online), but does not include applications that focus exclusively on administrative, financial, or clinical data, such as electronic medical records, dedicated clinical telemedicine applications or clinical decision-support systems for providers (<LINK REF="REF-Eng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to SciPICH (<LINK REF="REF-Eng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 1999</LINK>), the functions of IHCAs are to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>relay information;</LI>
<LI>enable informed decision making;</LI>
<LI>promote health behaviours;</LI>
<LI>promote peer information exchange and emotional support;</LI>
<LI>promote self-care; and</LI>
<LI>manage demand for health services.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Hence the important defining feature of an IHCA is that it does not simply provide health information, but combines such information with at least one (and frequently more than one) additional service. This additional service can be decision support, behaviour change support or peer support. The mode of delivery is not important in defining IHCAs. Nor is the site of use important in this definition, although access may have an impact on the effects of IHCAs. Hence, IHCAs can be used by individuals in their own homes, or through public internet access points, such as doctors' offices, internet cafes, libraries or information kiosks. IHCAs do not include new mechanisms for simple doctor-patient communication; e-mail between a physician and patient is therefore not an IHCA. Some IHCAs, however, do include e-mail components, where users can e-mail questions to a dedicated health professional. This professional is not usually part of the patient's normal health care team. Peer support is often in the form of online chat rooms, peer posting of answers to Frequently Asked Questions, or patient stories about their illness journey.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential benefits and harms of IHCAs</HEADING>
<P>The overwhelming majority of the published literature in this field refers to potential benefits of IHCAs. Even the SciPICH panel, which was intended to take a strategic overview of the area, pays little attention to the potential harms of IHCAs, referring briefly to the need for evaluation to identify unintended negative consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Eng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 1999</LINK>). In terms of the functions of IHCAs listed above, the published consensus thinking can be summarised as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Relaying information</HEADING>
<P>IHCAs are expected to be superior to conventional means of relaying information to patients, as IHCAs can contain large volumes of information, but present it in small, accessible chunks. Information can be updated centrally as new research evidence becomes available. Good web design is expected to allow users to 'drill down' to reach the level of information desired, ranging from broad introductory information to detailed information about, for example, treatments currently under development. Information can be tailored to individuals, according to data provided by the user, for example, on their dietary or exercise habits. This increases the personal relevance and retention of information (<LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1998</LINK>). Moreover, the information can be presented in accessible formats, by using video and audio clips, simple graphics and personal stories. IHCAs can be visited and revisited at the user's convenience, either as information needs change, for a reminder, or to share information with friends, family or carers.</P>
<P>There are, however, both theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that health information on its own is insufficient to achieve positive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Haby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haby 2001</LINK>). Combining information with peer support, behaviour change support or decision support may lead to some of the following benefits expected from an IHCA (<LINK REF="REF-Klemm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klemm 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Enabling informed decision-making</HEADING>
<P>The expectation here is that well-informed patients will be more able to make informed decisions than patients who do not have access to information. IHCAs do not have to contain formal decision-support tools, although some do.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Promoting health behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Again, the expectation here is that well-informed people are more likely to follow healthy behaviours than poorly-informed people. However, this assumption is probably only partially correct - if knowledge was all that was needed to promote healthy behaviour, smoking, for example, would not be as prevalent as it is.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Promoting peer information exchange and emotional support</HEADING>
<P>Patient desire for peer information exchange and emotional support has been well documented, and forms the basis for the many successful self-help organisations that exist across the developed world. SciPICH and other researchers in this field have postulated that IHCAs will allow the formation of online support communities, and that these will be beneficial to participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Promoting self-care</HEADING>
<P>This assumption is based on the literature on self-care. It is known that peer-led groups can promote self-care (<LINK REF="REF-Bodenheimer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodenheimer 2002</LINK>), and proponents of IHCAs suggest that this function can be delivered through online groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Managing demand for health services</HEADING>
<P>This assumption may also be flawed, as it is based on the view that well-informed consumers, actively engaging in self-care, will place less demand on health services than those who are less well informed. The rationale for this assumption comes from Lorig's work on self-care for chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bodenheimer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodenheimer 2002</LINK>). However, the alternative is also possible: well-informed consumers may recognise the value of specific treatments, thus increasing uptake and hence costs.</P>
<P>There is no list of possible harms of IHCAs in the literature; however there are references to the following areas of concern:</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Equity</HEADING>
<P>Will IHCAs increase or reduce equity in terms of access to services, quality of care and health outcomes? On the one hand, the widespread access to the internet may help to promote equity, allowing people access to information they would find hard to access using traditional media. Alternatively, the 'digital divide' may increase disparities, either in terms of access to information, or in the use people are able to make of the information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">False or misleading information</HEADING>
<P>The possibility of IHCAs providing false or misleading information, and the effects of such misinformation have caused concern (<LINK REF="REF-Eysenbach-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eysenbach 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Privacy</HEADING>
<P>In order for an IHCA to provide tailored information, the user has to input substantial detail about his or her health. How will the privacy of this information be guarded?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Malpractice</HEADING>
<P>Some writers have raised concerns about malpractice issues, particularly from the point of view of developers of IHCAs and those with commercial interests. Can such developers be sued if a user has an unexpected negative outcome as a result of using the IHCA? (<LINK REF="REF-Patrick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality criteria</HEADING>
<P>Accuracy of information, safeguarding of privacy, and issues around malpractice represent some of the components of overarching concern about IHCA quality. What are the criteria for a 'good' IHCA? Should there be a body responsible for licensing or monitoring IHCAs, and if so, who should be represented on this body, and how should it operate? (<LINK REF="REF-Patrick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for developing IHCAs for people with chronic disease</HEADING>
<P>Chronic disease is defined as a disease or condition that is ongoing, in contrast to acute conditions which resolve completely within a relatively short time period. People with chronic disease can be considered to be on an illness journey (<LINK REF="REF-Lapsley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapsley 2004</LINK>), starting with the original symptoms which lead to diagnosis, and continuing through phases which may include relapse and remission; steady levels of health; improvement; or deterioration.</P>
<P>There is good evidence that people with chronic disease want more, and better, information about their health problems and the various treatment options available (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1999</LINK>). Information needs tend to change as patients progress through their illness journey, and different patients will have different needs at different points (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2002</LINK>). Some people will only want access to simple information, while others will want to be as well informed as possible, and will search for detailed, in-depth information (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Self-management of chronic disease requires a number of tasks and skills. According to Lorig (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003</LINK>), there are three sets of tasks: first the medical management of the condition, such as taking medication, adhering to a diet, or using an inhaler. The second set of tasks involves maintaining, changing and creating new meaningful behaviours or life roles. The final set of tasks is dealing with the emotional sequelae of having a chronic condition. Emotions such as anger, fear, frustration and depression are commonly experienced by someone with a chronic disease; hence learning to manage these emotions is part of the work required to manage the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Corbin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbin 1988</LINK>). The skills needed for these tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, finding and utilising resources, forming partnerships with healthcare workers and taking action (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003</LINK>). Lorig postulates that enhancing self-efficacy (ie. a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) is a key step in programmes that effectively enable patients to improve their self-management skills (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>IHCAs have the potential to address these multiple needs. IHCAs can provide accurate, detailed information in an accessible way. They can provide peer support, which may help with the tasks relating to life roles and negative emotions. We have also seen that the literature claims that IHCAs may enable decision-making, and promote desirable health behaviours (which may require taking action).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">International situation</HEADING>
<P>The majority of work in this field has been undertaken in the USA. Most of the evaluations have occurred in academic centres; however, a large and increasing number of IHCAs are developed outside the academic framework, and are sold to health insurance companies and other healthcare providers as a means of maintaining patient satisfaction while reducing healthcare costs. In Australia, the benefits of internet access to health information for rural populations, often living long distances from urban centres, has been well recognised, and there has been considerable investment in this, including in IHCAs. In the UK, IHCAs are at the intersection of a number of core National Health Service (NHS) policies. These include the Expert Patient Policy (<LINK REF="REF-DOH_x003b_-EPTF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH; EPTF 2001</LINK>), which recognises the importance of patient expertise in self-management, and the heavy investment in online information for both patients and professionals (eg. NHS Direct Online, nhs.uk, and the National Electronic Library for Health). For example, NHS Direct Online has a budget of £7.5 million over three years to place patient information materials on its website. Research in the UK is, however, less well developed than that in the USA. Overall, work in the field of IHCAs is at present limited to the developed world.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Existing systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>Two systematic reviews which overlap with IHCAs for chronic disease have already been undertaken - one on computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2002</LINK>) and one on decision aids (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy</HEADING>
<P>Kaltenthaler's review, published in 2002, examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of CCBT compared to 'treatment as usual' or therapist-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for treatment of depression and/or anxiety. Included in this remit were generalised anxiety, panic disorders, agoraphobia, social phobia and specific phobias. The intervention studied was CCBT delivered alone or as part of a package of care, either via a computer interface or over the telephone with a computer-led interface. The review included RCTs, and, for outcomes where RCT evidence was not available, non-randomised studies. Sixteen studies were included, from which the authors concluded that there was some evidence of poor-to-moderate quality that CCBT is as effective as therapist-led CBT in clinically-depressed, anxious or phobic outpatient and primary care populations. Authors also reported limited evidence of poor-to-moderate quality that CCBT is more effective than treatment as usual for these patient populations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Decision aids</HEADING>
<P>O'Connor's Cochrane review, updated in 2003, examined the effects of decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions. They define decision aids as "preparing people to participate in preference-sensitive decisions." In order for an intervention to be included in the review, it had to be "designed to help people make specific and deliberative choices among options (including the status quo) by providing (at the minimum) information on the options and outcomes relevant to a person's health status. The aid also may have included: information on the disease/condition; costs associated with options; probabilities of outcomes tailored to personal health risk factors; an explicit values clarification exercise; information on others' opinions; a personalized recommendation on the basis of clinical characteristics and expressed preferences; and guidance or coaching in the steps of decision making and in communicating with others."</P>
<P>Decision aids range from simple paper-and-pencil aids to complex multimedia computer programmes. Thirty-four RCTs were included in this review, and provided evidence that, compared to usual care, decision aids improved user knowledge, led to more realistic expectations, reduced decisional conflict relating to feeling informed, increased the proportion of people active in decision making and reduced the proportion of people who remained undecided post intervention. Decision aids did no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety and health outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Relationships with this review</HEADING>
<P>Whether CCBT fulfils the definition of an IHCA will depend on the makeup of individual programmes. Where the programme contains health information coupled with behaviour change support, it would fit in the remit of an IHCA. However, where the programme more closely mimics a client-therapist relationship, it may well not. The primary aim of CCBT is to replace (or in some cases act as an adjunct to) therapist-led CBT, that is, to enable patients to identify, and subsequently alter, the cognitions and behaviours which lead to the development and maintenance of mental health problems. They are not primarily designed to relay information; enable informed decision making; promote health behaviours; promote peer information exchange and emotional support; promote self-care; or manage demand for health services. Their primary aim was well addressed in the Kaltenthaler review (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2002</LINK>). We decided it was inappropriate to subdivide CCBT packages into those which were IHCAs, and those which were not, and then assess the former against aims which the packages were not designed to address.</P>
<P>Similarly, some decision aids are IHCAs, while others are not. Again, decision aids have a unifying primary aim, stated in the O'Connor review (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>), which is to prepare people for participating in preference-sensitive decisions. Decision aids tend to focus on rubicon decisions - for example, participating in a screening programme, or having an operation. In contrast, although IHCAs often contain decision support, this is only one component of the total package. The decision support may be around more ongoing issues, for example, when to increase the dose of inhaled steroids for a patient with asthma. As with our approach to CCBT, we decided not to subdivide decision aids into those which were IHCAs and those which were not, but to exclude decision aids from the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Postulated pathway of action of IHCAs</HEADING>
<P>Review of the health psychology literature (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 2001</LINK>), coupled with proposed pathways of action of specific IHCAs (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 1999</LINK>) or other self-management interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003</LINK>), led us to postulate that IHCAs act by combining information with additional services (peer support, decision support or behaviour change support) to allow internalisation and interpretation of the information by the user. This leads to changes in knowledge, motivation for improved health or health behaviours, affective parameters and self-efficacy. It is likely that these factors interact with each other; for example, understanding the risks of the condition may increase or reduce the user's anxiety levels with subsequent follow-on effect on their motivation to improve health. The combination of enhanced self-efficacy with motivation and knowledge enables users to change their health behaviours, leading in turn to changes in clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Our analytical approach was designed to test this hypothesised pathway of action. Hence, we did not examine outcomes such as decisional confidence, which were not part of the hypothesised pathway of action.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of rationale for review</HEADING>
<P>The literature contains many claims for potential benefits of IHCAs, and very substantial investment in IHCAs is occurring in the USA and UK; however it is unclear to what extent these benefits actually occur. This review examined the effects of IHCAs for people with chronic disease. The objectives were designed to test the claims in the literature for potential benefits of IHCAs and our postulated pathway of action. Outcomes which were not reflected in our hypothesised pathway of action were not examined, with the exception of economic outcomes which we considered to be of great interest to health service policy makers and managers and so were included. Potential harms were insufficiently described in the literature to be formally tested in this review; however, we scrutinised included studies for evidence of unintended adverse consequences.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:31:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>In our protocol, we had planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials, before-and-after studies, interrupted time series analyses and economic evaluations. We had intended to use RCTs to draw conclusions about effectiveness; before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies for conclusions about 'promising interventions' ready for trialling; and qualitative studies and surveys to inform the background and discussion. This over-inclusiveness was designed to avoid missing important or significant data in a rapidly expanding field, preliminary exploration of which suggested that it did not contain many RCTs. However, the search strategy found 24 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria. We were therefore able to raise the study design threshold for inclusion in the review to include RCTs only, as these provide a more robust level of evidence. N of 1 trials were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People of all ages with chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1995</LINK>). This includes children, as long as the intervention was able to be used by the child. Community, primary care, outpatient and inpatient populations were included. Some interventions were aimed at carers, particularly for patients with Alzheimer's; results for carers are reported separately.</P>
<P>Chronic disease was defined as a disease or condition that is ongoing, in contrast to acute conditions which resolve completely within a relatively short time period. Common chronic diseases include diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and renal failure. In accordance with current guidelines, obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg / m<SUP>2</SUP>) was considered a chronic disease, whereas being overweight but not obese (BMI &lt; 30 kg / m<SUP>2</SUP>) was not. Where there was any doubt as to whether a condition was a chronic disease or not, the decision was referred to the steering group.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:31:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>IHCAs, as defined by SciPICH and described in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> to this review. This was operationalised as any package that required the user to interact directly with any form of computer, and contained health information plus at least one of peer support, decision support or behaviour change support, and was not defined by the authors of the paper as a decision aid or computerised cognitive behavioural therapy.</P>
<P>Comparisons: normal care, non-interactive forms of patient education (e.g. written, audiotape, video, group or one-to-one didactic sessions led by either peers or professionals); interactive educational sessions led either by peers or professionals.</P>
<P>We excluded decision aids and computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for the reasons given in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>). We excluded decision-support systems aimed solely at professionals, and simple information packages that did not contain social support, decision support or behaviour change support, as these are not IHCAs. Similarly, we excluded interventions that only contained social support, decision support or behaviour change support with no health information, as this did not fit our operationalisation of the SciPICH definition.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcome measures were chosen to reflect our objectives. These were in turn based on the benefits of IHCAs claimed in the literature, and on our postulated pathway of action of IHCAs. Our outcome categories were: effects on patients in terms of knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, emotions and health behaviours; health outcomes; and resource utilisation. Self-efficacy refers to a person's belief in their capacity to undertake a specific action or achieve a specific goal. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:02:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We designed a four-part search strategy. First, we searched the following electronic databases:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2003;</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE (1990 to 2003);</LI>
<LI>EMBASE (1990 to 2003);</LI>
<LI>PsycINFO (1990 to 2003);</LI>
<LI>CINAHL (1990 to 2003).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Second, to capture grey literature, we searched:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>ASLIB Index to Theses (1990 to 2003);</LI>
<LI>Dissertation Abstracts (1990 to 2003);</LI>
<LI>System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (1990 to 2003);</LI>
<LI>for conference proceedings, the Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings database (1990 to 2003).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Third, for ongoing and recently-completed clinical trials, we searched:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>National Research Register (2003);</LI>
<LI>International Register of Controlled Trials (2003);</LI>
<LI>MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (2003).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Finally, we contacted researchers of included studies and screened reference lists from relevant primary and review articles for potentially useful studies. As IHCAs require relatively new technology, most work in this area has been undertaken since 1995. In order to capture early or pioneering studies, the search was started at 1990 where possible. As our original protocol was not limited to RCTs, no RCT-only filter was applied.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Biomedical databases</HEADING>
<P>The systematic review topic was reduced to two concepts: interactive health communication applications (IHCAs) and functions of the interactive health communication applications (functions). Although the systematic review focused on chronic disease, we agreed it would be impossible to list all chronic diseases, so the decision as to whether the disease described in the study was 'chronic' was made at the screening abstracts stage. Queries were referred to the steering group for discussion.</P>
<P>A number of papers discussing interactive health communication were read and were used to generate a list of thesaurus and text word search terms to create a search strategy in the MEDLINE database. The search was run and the resulting papers were examined to assess their relevance and to gauge the precision and comprehensiveness of the search strategy. Overall it was thought that the strategy was identifying appropriate papers. A few minor additional phrase terms were added to the search strategy, namely digital interactive television and interactive video disks. Finally a validated methodology filter designed to capture clinical trials, RCTs and prospective studies was added to the search (see below).</P>
<P>In order to avoid missing potentially useful references, we generated a list of examples of interactive health communication software packages, and ran a second search on these. This second search did not retrieve any unique references when compared to the original MEDLINE search, and thus only the first MEDLINE strategy was employed. The MEDLINE search strategy was used as a model for searching the EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases.</P>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Library</I> was searched in two parts. The <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews </I>(CDSR), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched using the KA24 Ovid Interface. This version of <I>The Cochrane Library</I> does not support thesaurus searching, and therefore only the text words and phrases from the MEDLINE search strategy could be used.</P>
<P>The Health Technology Assessment database (HTA) and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database database (NHSEED), part of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, were searched via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination's website using a modified version of the MEDLINE strategy. In both these databases, it was not possible to build up the search set-by-set (line-by-line) and then link them by 'AND', thus each line of the MEDLINE strategy had to be run as a separate search. It was decided at this point to search only the IHCA terms, and to view the records to see if any of them described interactive health communication functions, rather than inputting all lines of the MEDLINE search relating to the functions of IHCAs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Grey literature</HEADING>
<P>SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe), the ASLIB Index to Theses, Dissertation Abstracts, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Register, the MetaRegister of Randomised Controlled Trials and the National Research Register were all searched using the same approach as the HTA and NHSEED databases (ie. using just the IHCA terms). For the Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings, this again was searched using free text terms and phrases to cover IHCAs. This database covers all areas of science, and thus to avoid generating unmanageable numbers of records, it was necessary to link the very general search phrases, eg. computers communication, to one or more of the following search terms: medicine OR health OR therap* OR counsel* OR health education OR patient education OR health promotion.</P>
<P>The search strategy for MEDLINE is given at <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. Modified versions of this strategy were used for other databases and registers, and are available in full from the review authors on request.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Document retrieval</HEADING>
<P>Citations and brief records identified by the search strategy were downloaded electronically into a bibliographic management package (RefMan10), whenever possible. Where search results could not be saved electroncally, paper records were kept. Titles and/or abstracts were assessed by a single researcher (EM or JB). Assessments erred on the side of inclusiveness; in other words, if we could not definitely exclude the study at this stage, we requested the full paper. There was no language restriction. Where necessary, we sought help for translation from colleagues.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study selection process</HEADING>
<P>This was a multi-stage process. The selection criteria were applied liberally to the titles and/or abstracts generated by the search. All titles and abstracts identified as potentially reporting studies involving an IHCA for people with a chronic disease were provisionally included for consideration on the basis of full text articles. The reproducibility of this process was tested in the early stages of the review and found to be good. Final inclusion/exclusion decisions were made by consensus by two independent researchers (EM and JB) after retrieving the full text copies of all potentially-relevant citations and determining whether they met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements or questions were referred to the steering group, where a decision was reached by consensus and the reasons for the decision recorded.</P>
<P>All studies which fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the systematic review, and listed in the table of included studies. Included studies which presented sufficient data to allow calculation of standardised mean differences (SMD) or odds ratios (OR) were included in the relevant meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two independent researchers (EM and JB) assessed RCTs for quality. In line with the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>), studies were assessed for adequacy of concealment of allocation to experimental or control groups. Concealment of allocation was considered adequate if centralised randomisation or another robust method to prevent foreknowledge were used. Inadequate measures included use of alternation, case record numbers, birth dates, weekdays or open random number lists. Studies were rated as having adequate concealment of allocation (A); unclear (B); or having inadequate concealment (C) (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two other important factors contributing to study validity are blinding the assessor to participant's allocated group, and follow-up. Almost all studies relied heavily on self-reports for measurement of outcomes, and many of the outcomes are subjective, so blinding the assessor was not possible, and we did not apply this criterion. Information on the follow-up rate is provided in an additional table giving further information on included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (EM and SST) independently extracted data. Data extracted included: author(s); date of publication; details of the intervention and control; details of participants; outcome measures reported in the primary studies; duration of follow-up and time at which outcomes were measured; and end-point mean, standard deviation and number of participants for the main outcome measure in each category of outcomes. Data were extracted onto standardised computer-based forms. Disagreements about data extracted were addressed by discussion between the two review authors. If the disagreement could not have been resolved by discussion, it would have been referred to the steering group; however this was not necessary. Only data from one outcome measure per outcome category were extracted, to prevent double counting. When there was more than one outcome measure in a particular outcome category, the decision as to which outcome data would be extracted was taken in a steering group meeting. These decisions were based on the clinical importance, or importance to consumers, of the outcome; or on the similarity of the outcome to those reported in other studies to enable data synthesis. The steering group were not aware of the results for each outcome during these discussions. When there were data missing, or where it was not possible to extract the necessary data because of the way it had been presented in the paper, we contacted the lead author requesting further information. As a result of these requests, missing data were provided for three studies, and stated not to be available for one study.</P>
<P>Once the data had been double extracted into computer-based forms, it was entered into RevMan by one review author (SST). Printouts of the data entered into RevMan were independently checked against the data entry forms and the original papers by two review authors (EM and JB).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We decided to pool the data in a meta-analysis for a number of reasons. This review examines the effects of an intervention (IHCA) across a range of chronic disease, and is deliberately not limited to one disease. As this is a relatively new area of research, there are only a handful of studies in each disease area. This is insufficient to allow us to perform a meta-analysis for any one disease area. Further, IHCAs are designed to achieve similar outcomes (eg. beneficial changes in knowledge, perceived social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes) across a range of diseases. We postulate that the IHCAs have a common method of working across all diseases (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). For these reasons, we believe it appropriate to pool the data across studies for the various outcome categories.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2002</LINK>) reported data from carers, as the intervention was targeted at carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease/memory loss. We decided not to combine data from carers with data from patients; however, where it was possible to calculate SMDs for carers' outcomes these are included in the <LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_TABLES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional tables</LINK> of results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Calculation of individual study estimates of the effect of the IHCA</HEADING>
<P>The study outcome categories were knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, emotional, behavioural, clinical and economic outcomes. Data reported for emotional outcomes were too diverse to pool, and data for economic outcomes were too incomplete to allow extraction of meaningful data. Hence, meta-analyses were only performed for knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, behavioural and clinical outcomes. Final assessment means, standard deviations and sample sizes of the main outcome measure in each outcome category were used for each individual study's estimates. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 2001</LINK>) presented covariate adjusted end point means for their behavioural and social support outcomes and for clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2003</LINK>). These adjusted means and standard deviations were used in the calculations for these outcomes.</P>
<P>The knowledge outcome for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Horan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Horan 1990</LINK>), behavioural outcomes for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guendelman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guendelman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Horan 1990</LINK>), and clinical outcome for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Guendelman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guendelman 2002</LINK>) were expressed as binary variables. The data for the behavioural outcome 'takes asthma medication without a reminder' in (<LINK REF="STD-Guendelman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guendelman 2002</LINK>) were presented in the original paper in three categories: 'seldom or never,' 'most' or 'all' of the time. For the purpose of analysis, these three categories were dichotomised into 'seldom or never' versus 'most or all' of the time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Use of standardised mean difference</HEADING>
<P>The effect size for all continuous outcome variables was calculated as the standardised mean difference (SMD), which is the difference in the intervention and control group means divided by the pooled standard deviation with an adjustment for small sample bias. The SMD was used as there were several different scales or measures used to measure the same outcome. In the social support, emotional, behavioural and clinical outcome categories, some scales represented an improved outcome with an increased score, while others represented an improved outcome with a lower score. In order to harmonise these, for those outcomes where improvement was represented by a decreased score, the final means were multiplied by -1 as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (Section 8.2.2.2) (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>) before being entered into RevMan. SMDs were classified as positive when in favour of the intervention, and negative when in favour of the control. They were also categorised according to Lipsey categories, that is, small = 0 to 0.32; medium &gt; 0.32 to 0.55; and large &gt; 0.55 (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsey 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Use of odds ratios</HEADING>
<P>The knowledge outcome for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Horan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Horan 1990</LINK>), behavioural outcomes for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guendelman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guendelman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Horan 1990</LINK>), and clinical outcome for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Guendelman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guendelman 2002</LINK>) were expressed as binary variables. The final assessment odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for all binary outcomes as: odds of favourable event in intervention group / odds of favourable event in control group as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (Box 8.2.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Outcomes in favour of the intervention (IHCA) were thereby represented by odds ratios greater than 1. For consistency, the clinical binary outcome of 'any limitation in activity' was reversed to 'no limitation of activity' so that an OR of greater than 1 continued to represent an outcome in favour of the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Combining the results in a random-effects meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>RevMan 4.2 software was used to combine the individual study SMDs in a meta-analysis. There are two models for combining the effects of several studies: the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model. The fixed-effects model assumes that the only variability that occurs between studies arises from random variation and assumes a common effect. The random-effects model assumes that the effects in the studies are not all the same and takes this into consideration as an additional source of variation. Effects are also assumed to be randomly distributed, and the combined effect estimate is the central point of this distribution (<I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> Section 8.6) (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). A random-effects meta-analysis is more conservative, and was used here as it was considered a more appropriate model to combine the results of the included studies which were clinically and methodologically diverse. Variations included different IHCAs, different lengths of exposure to the intervention (from 20 minutes to over 9 months), and different disease conditions. The random-effects meta-analysis performed in RevMan uses a variation on the inverse variance method known as the DerSimonian and Laird method (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>), which also includes assessments for heterogeneity (<I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook </I>Section 8.6.2) (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Heterogeneity may be present as a result of clinical or methodological differences between studies. Separate meta-analyses were performed for knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, behavioural and clinical outcomes. An overall effect was calculated for each meta-analysis, and a positive value indicated the effect was in favour of the intervention. The three binary behavioural outcomes were combined in a separate random-effects meta-analysis.</P>
<P>In order to describe a gradient of effect sizes across the range of outcomes addressed, in presenting the results, we have distinguished between those which had a positive effect (favouring the intervention) and were statistically significant, and those where the results suggest that it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on outcomes, but where the results were not statistically significant.</P>

<P>Five studies reported sufficient detail on allocation procedures for the assessors to be reasonably certain that concealment of allocation was adequate. Nineteen studies simply said that participants were randomly allocated, but gave insufficient information about the methods of randomisation and/or the concealment of allocation. Twenty-one of the 24 included studies reported information on follow-up rates. Of these, six achieved follow-up rates of 100%; six achieved rates of 90 to 100%; four achieved rates of 80 to 89%; three achieved rates of 70 to 79%; and two reported follow-up rates of between 60 to 69%.

<P>For those outcomes where meta-analysis could be undertaken, we present the results of the meta-analysis, as this provides the clearest and most succinct summary of the results. However, for two outcome categories (emotional and economic), meta-analysis could not be undertaken, either because there were insufficient studies reporting data in this outcome category, or because the various outcome measures were judged to be too dissimilar to justify pooling the data. In these cases we present a narrative summary of the findings. In addition, we searched for unintended adverse consequences of IHCA; no study reported these.<BR/>

<P>Brown examined an interactive computer programme in video game format which featured two adolescent elephant friends (Packy and Marlon) at a diabetes summer camp. Players had to save the camp from rats and mice. In order to do this, players had to help monitor the elephants' blood glucose, give insulin, review diabetes logbooks, find correct foods and encourage self-care in various situations. The intervention group had home access to this video game system for six months; the control group had home access to a non-educational video game and entertainment video for six months. The study population was children with diabetes mellitus, aged 8 -16, recruited from two paediatric outpatient clinics.

<P>Horan examined an intervention comprising fifteen weeks of home access to a micro-computer, which combined diabetes education with data management and review, as well as goal setting and problem solving. This was compared with a conventional diabetes education booklet for 20 adolescents who had had Type 1 diabetes for more than one year. At the fifteen week follow up, the proportion of participants who had increased their knowledge by more than 5% was higher in the intervention group (n = 9) than in the control group (n = 9).

<P>Brown examined an interactive computer programme in video game format which featured two adolescent elephant friends (Packy and Marlon) at a diabetes summer camp. Players had to save the camp from rats and mice. In order to do this, players had to help monitor the elephants' blood glucose, give insulin, review diabetes logbooks, find correct foods and encourage self-care in various situations. The intervention group had home access to this video game system for six months; the control group had home access to a non-educational video game and entertainment video for six months. The study population was children with diabetes mellitus, aged 8 -16, recruited from two paediatric outpatient clinics.

Data were reported for use of ambulatory care services (non-emergency visits, average visit time, emergency visits and phone calls) and for hospitalisation (number of hospitalisations per subject, average length of stay when hospitalised and hospital days per subject). Data were collected in three two-month periods: prior to installation of CHESS, during the installation period, and after CHESS had been removed from participants' homes. Data from the two-month period prior to installation were not presented. Data comparing health service utilisation during the CHESS installation period with the after CHESS had been removed period showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups for non-emergency and emergency visits. However, average visit time was shorter in the intervention group than the control group during implementation (42.91 minutes versus 49.38 minutes, p = 0.043); this difference became non-significant after the computer programme had been removed (31.07 minutes versus 29.59 minutes, p &gt; 0.2).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:35:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>IHCAs have been developed for a range of chronic diseases and all age ranges, from preschool children to carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, overall conclusions regarding their effects are limited by the range of populations in the trials, disparate conditions studied, the variable nature of the IHCA, and the differing intensity of exposure (from 20 minutes, to many hours spread over six to nine months). Researchers used very different outcomes, and even where similar outcomes were studied, different outcome measures were used. Control groups received variable interventions. In spite of these limitations, some tentative conclusions emerge.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Main results</HEADING>
<P>IHCAs have a significant positive effect on knowledge, perceived social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes. Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy. It was not possible to determine the effects of IHCAs on emotional or economic outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Knowledge </HEADING>
<P>The effect on knowledge is compatible with previous work on computer-assisted learning (CAL), which has repeatedly demonstrated that CAL is at least as effective, and often more effective, than traditional teaching methods (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-Flinn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher Flinn 1995</LINK>). Similarly, O'Connor (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>) found that decision aids, when compared to usual care, substantially increased knowledge about the condition and decision faced amongst users. It is likely that there are a number of factors contributing to IHCAs' ability to improve knowledge, including the interactive nature of the information, the use of audio, graphics and video to present the information, and users' ability to revisit the information repeatedly over time.</P>

<P>Qualitative studies of IHCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boisen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boisen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glueckauf-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glueckauf 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McTavish-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McTavish 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolnick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolnick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheerhorn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheerhorn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2002</LINK>) suggest that social support is of great importance to users. The positive effect of IHCAs on social support demonstrated in this review is therefore an important finding. Qualitative studies suggest that the important features of social support include the 24-hour availability of the online discussion group and the ability to share experiences with people with the same illness, and hence, facing similar problems. Our results differ from, but are compatible with, the systematic review examining electronic support groups (ESG) by Eysenbach et al (<LINK REF="REF-Eysenbach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eysenbach 2004</LINK>). This review identified 38 distinct studies of which 20 were randomised trials, 11 were before-and-after studies, three were non-randomised controlled trials, three were meta-analyses of n of 1 trials, and one was a cohort study. Only six of these studies evaluated 'pure' peer-to-peer communities, and one had a factorial design with a 'peer-to-peer only' arm, whereas 31 evaluated complex interventions. Eysenbach and colleagues considered that this made it impossible to attribute intervention effects to the peer-to-peer community component. This review found that most studies did not show an effect, but that there was no evidence to support concerns over ESG harming people. There was some overlap between the studies included in the review of ESG and our IHCA review (namely <LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 2001</LINK>). Brennan 1995 was excluded from our meta-analysis as it examined carers. In the remaining four studies, both sets of review authors reached similar conclusions. The overall difference in findings between the two reviews is therefore likely to reflect different inclusion criteria in terms of the intervention (electronic support groups versus IHCA), the population studied (all populations versus patients with chronic disease), and accepted methodologies (all evaluative studies versus RCT only).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Behavioral outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The positive effect of IHCAs on behaviour change demonstrated by the meta-analysis of continuous data is supported by the result of the meta-analysis of binary data, which also showed a positive effect. The lack of statistical significance in the binary data is likely to be due to the small number of studies combined in analysis. Our findings are compatible with other work in this area. A recent narrative review by Nguyen et al of 17 articles reporting studies that evaluated the impact of professionally facilitated internet-based programmes for diverse clinical populations on health outcomes (including behaviour change outcomes), suggested that some outcomes in certain groups can be moderately improved (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2004</LINK>). Again, this review differed from ours in terms of the intervention (professionally facilitated internet-based programmes versus IHCA), the populations studied (all clinical populations versus patients with chronic disease), and accepted methodologies (all evaluative studies versus RCT only).</P>
<P>Wantland (<LINK REF="REF-Wantland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wantland 2004</LINK>) undertook a meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of web-based versus non-web-based interventions on behaviour change. This study included 22 studies, although these authors decided not to continue with the meta-analysis, in view of the heterogeneity of included studies. These authors did report, however, that 16 of the 17 studied effect outcomes revealed improved knowledge and / or behavioural outcomes for participants using the web-based interventions compared to the non-web-based interventions. Five of the studies in the Wantland review are also included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Krishna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krishna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritterband-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritterband 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1998</LINK>). Studies that were included in the Wantland review, but not in our review, included those where the intervention was computerised cognitive behavioural therapy, studies which were not randomised controlled trials, and studies where the study population did not have a chronic disease (for example, exercise promotion in non-clinical populations; weight loss in overweight, as opposed to obese, populations; eating disorder prevention in a non-clinical student population). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Self-efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Only three studies reported data on self-efficacy. Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy. Further data on this outcome are needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Emotional outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We were unable to determine whether IHCAs have an effect on emotional outcomes. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Clinical outcomes </HEADING>
<P>Results suggest that IHCAs have a significant positive effect on clinical outcomes. There was some heterogeneity in this outcome, but despite this, IHCAs are most likely to be beneficial in terms of clinical outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Study eligibility </HEADING>
<P>Despite earlier concerns that there would not be sufficient RCTs to explore the effects of IHCAs, we were able to identify 24 RCTs for inclusion in the review. This allowed us to revise the threshold for inclusion to cover RCTs only. This raised threshold gives our findings greater robustness than would have been possible if we had included other study designs, which are more susceptible to bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of heterogeneity in two of the meta-analyses, namely those for self-efficacy and social support. However, there was heterogeneity in three of the outcome categories where meta-analysis could be undertaken (knowledge, behaviour change and clinical outcomes). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic provides a measure of the variation between studies which can be explained by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Thus in the two meta-analyses where the I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, this suggests that the variations between the results of the studies included in meta-analysis can be completely explained by chance. However, where I<SUP>2</SUP> is 50%, the implication is that half of the variation in the overall results between the studies is attributable to genuine differences between the studies, and half the variation can be attributed to the play of chance. It has been suggested that the adjectives 'low', 'moderate' and 'high' can be tentatively assigned to I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 25%, 50% and 75%, although quantification of heterogeneity is only one component of a wider investigation of variability between studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>suggests that I<SUP>2</SUP> values over 50% represent 'substantial' heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>).
<BR/>

<BR/>Our meta-analyses showed substantial heterogeneity for two outcomes: knowledge (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52.8%) and behaviour change (I<SUP>2</SUP> for continuous data = 50.4% and for binary data = 48.2%). Clinical outcomes also showed some heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 30.6%). There are many possible reasons for this heterogeneity. As the aim of this review was to look at the effect of IHCAs in chronic disease, we combined data from very varied studies. The studies took place in different countries. The patients had different conditions, and included both children and adults. The intervention occurred in different settings (outpatient, primary care, community settings or the patient's own home), and there were large variations in the intensity of the exposure to the interventions, ranging from one-off use in a clinical environment to prolonged use in the patient's home. There was also variation in the intensity of the intervention provided to the control groups in the different studies. Further, the primary studies used many different outcome measures to assess similar outcomes, and included a wide variety of outcomes.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis for knowledge contained three studies of adults, and four of children. Three of the studies involved patients with asthma, two involved diabetes, one aimed to achieve weight loss in obese adults and one was aimed at people with eating disorders. The outcome measures used were all knowledge questionnaires. Participants had varying access to the intervention, ranging from single use in a health care setting to home use over a period of twelve months.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis for behaviour contained studies with varied populations: two on children, one on adult women, one where almost all participants were adult men, and three of adults of both genders. The conditions included asthma, diabetes, obesity, breast cancer and HIV / AIDS. The outcome measures varied between studies, including physical activity in minutes / day, participation in health care, dietary intake and self-management. In six of the studies providing continuous data, participants had home access to the intervention for between five and twelve months. In the remaining study by comparison, participants accessed the intervention during visits to a healthcare facility. The meta-analysis of binary data also contained studies with varied populations: two involved children with asthma and one involved adolescents with diabetes mellitus. Outcome measures were different for each study. In one study, users accessed the intervention over three visits to a healthcare facility. In the other two studies, participants had home access to the intervention for three to four months.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis for clinical outcomes contained studies with varied populations: five on children, five on adults; and with varied conditions including asthma, diabetes, obesity, breast cancer, HIV / AIDS and faecal soiling. The outcome measures varied between studies, except in studies of diabetes, where glycosylated haemoglobin was widely reported as a clinical outcome. Seven studies provided home access to the intervention, with duration of home access ranging from three weeks to twelve months. The remaining three studies provided sessional access.</P>
<P>It has been argued that we should not have attempted meta-analyses in the face of this heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Eysenbach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eysenbach 2005</LINK>). On the other hand, approximately one-quarter of Cochrane meta-analyses have been reported as having I<SUP>2</SUP> values over 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Our reason for pooling data from such varied sources was that the question asked by this review, that is, 'what are the effects of IHCA for patients with chronic disease?', could only be answered by looking across all situations where IHCAs have been used to date. The unifying theme was the intervention, namely an IHCA, as defined and operationalised in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>. We hypothesised that the different IHCAs worked in a similar way across different disease conditions (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Ideally, we would wish to combine data from studies that examined the same intervention used in similar populations, but we did not have sufficient studies to be able to do this. Hence we decided to combine the available data. However, the resulting heterogeneity does mean that these results must be treated with caution. There is evidence of an average benefit for IHCAs, but there is also evidence that the magnitude of the effect varied between studies, possibly because different studies looked at different interventions for different conditions. Thus for a particular intervention and condition, while the magnitude of the effect is unknown, the evidence suggests that the effects of IHCAs are most likely to be positive. Although no study reported on any unintended consequences of IHCAs, theoretically, the possibility of harm cannot be totally ruled out.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other methodological issues</HEADING>
<P>Many of the trials had small numbers of participants, and would therefore not have been able to detect small effects. There were also deficiencies in reporting of the data, which meant that while some studies reported outcomes relevant to this review, the data could not be included in the meta-analyses because the standard deviation (or other measure of variation) was not reported. Many of the trials relied on self-reported data from participants. Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind participants as to whether they had been in the control or intervention group. This lack of blinding may have introduced bias into the primary studies. Moreover, not all the studies used previously validated measures to assess outcomes, again introducing the possibility of bias into the primary data reported.</P>
<P>For all these reasons, the results reported in this review must be regarded with some caution. Further high quality trials with large numbers of participants are required.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:09:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The main implications of this review are for policy, not practice. As health policy tends to be nation-specific, these implications are likely to vary from country to country. We have tried to outline the main implications for policy for countries with highly-developed healthcare systems, as most of the work on IHCAs to date has been done in these countries.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Our review suggests that IHCAs have significant positive effects on knowledge, social support and behavioural and clinical outcomes, and are more likely than not to have significant positive effects on self-efficacy. These results support continued cautious investment in IHCAs, coupled with a rigorous programme of evaluation.</LI>
<LI>There is no evidence of the effects of IHCAs on health service utilisation. Thus IHCAs should not be used as a method of cost containment, pending further research.</LI>
<LI>It was not possible to examine formally whether IHCAs promote equity or result in greater health disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged populations. Available data suggests that IHCAs can benefit underserved populations (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 2001</LINK>) - whether they will do so in practice has yet to be determined.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-17 16:35:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Despite the significant sums of money invested in IHCAs, there are a large number of unanswered questions. These are listed below.</P>
<OL>
<LI>What is the mechanism of action of IHCAs? Some authors cite health psychology theories as a basis for why IHCAs should work, but it is not yet possible to determine from the available data how they actually do work. We hypothesised that clinical change would depend on behaviour change, which in turn would depend on enhanced self-efficacy, but it was not possible to test this hypothesis with our data. Further research to test this hypothesis is needed, as is work to determine which features of an IHCA are needed to achieve particular outcomes; which features are important for which group(s) of users; and what the optimal intensity of use may be. Another issue to be examined includes whether home access to an IHCA is essential? Or can intermittent access through public access points be equally effective?</LI>
<LI>Can IHCAs benefit carers? If so, in what way? What outcomes can be affected? If IHCAs can benefit carers, how do they do this? What are the essential features of an IHCA which are associated with benefit?</LI>
<LI>What are the effects of IHCAs on health service utilisation? Do knowledgeable active patients demand more from the health service (more medication, more preventive care) and if so, is the cost of this demand offset by reductions in complications or emergency care?</LI>
<LI>Are there unintended adverse effects of IHCAs? If so, what are they? How can they be detected? If these are rare events, post-marketing surveillance may be the appropriate methodology for detecting them, as it may be difficult to power RCTs for these outcomes.</LI>
<LI>How do IHCAs affect the doctor-patient relationship and patients' interactions with clinicians?</LI>
<LI>What support or training do clinicians need to consult effectively with enabled active patients?</LI>
<LI>What are the effects of IHCAs on equity? Do they increase or decrease health disparities, and what factors impact on this effect? Are there specifics of IHCA design, methods of delivery, or other organisational issues which are important? How do their effects vary in different cultures and economies? The importance of home access is also relevant to this question.</LI>
</OL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Implications for consumers </HEADING>
<P>Consumers with chronic disease are likely to benefit from using an IHCA through their positive effects on knowledge, social support, health behaviour and clinical outcomes. IHCAs are also more likely than not to positively affect self-efficacy, that is, a person's belief in their capacity to undertake specific action or achieve a goal, and this may also benefit consumers. There is a need for more large, high quality studies to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.</P>
