<P>Malaria may cause anaemia. In areas where malaria is common and transmission is intense, many children are infected with the parasite, and severe anaemia can commonly cause death. Blood transfusions can be important for preventing deaths in very ill patients, although there are also some risks involved. This review was designed to assess the benefits and harms of giving a blood transfusion to all children with severe malarial anaemia but otherwise not in distress or severely unwell.</P>
<P>Two studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 230 children included in them; no studies looked at adults. There were fewer deaths in children who had blood transfusion compared with those who did not, but the numbers were small and not statistically significant. There was a trend towards more severe adverse events in the transfusion group, but a trend toward shorter hospital stay. The proportion of blood volume made up of red blood cells (haematocrit) was lower in transfused versus non-transfused children at day 28.</P>
<P>In conclusion, for a clinician faced with a child with severe anaemia who is otherwise stable and not distressed, there is insufficient evidence to know whether the risks of routine blood transfusion outweigh the benefit.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2010), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2010), EMBASE (1980 to April 2010), LILACS (April 2010), and reference lists of relevant articles.

<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of blood transfusion compared with conservative management in malaria-associated severe anaemia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials were identified and data extracted by a single reviewer (MM) and checked by a second (HS). Inclusion criteria were applied and data were extracted independently by both reviewers.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 16:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two randomized trials of 230 children were included. In the transfusion group, there was a non-significant tendency towards fewer deaths (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.70), but a trend towards more severe adverse events (RR 8.60, 95% CI 1.11 to 66.43). In one trial by Bojang (1997a) respiratory distress was less common and hospital stay was shorter in the transfusion group (MD 1.88 days, 95% CI 2.41 to 1.35). Subsequent need for urgent blood transfusion was less common in the transfusion group (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.68). Day 28 packed cell volume was less in the transfusion group (MD -1.34, 95% CI -2.57 to -0.11). There was no information on HIV or Hepatitis B virus transmission.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient data to be sure whether routinely giving blood to clinically stable children with severe anaemia in endemic malarious areas reduces death, or results in higher haematocrit measured at one month.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-10 13:08:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Severe anaemia and cerebral malaria complicate <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> infection, and cause most of the 1-2 million deaths caused by malaria each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). In areas with stable and intense transmission of malaria, anaemia may cause more deaths than cerebral malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Slutsker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Slutsker 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Snow--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood transfusion is often given to patients with severe malarial anaemia, and can be important in preventing death in very ill patients (<LINK REF="STD-English-1996" TYPE="STUDY">English 1996</LINK>). In other patients who are clinically stable, blood may be given simply on the basis of low haemoglobin, to prevent clinical deterioration. The other potential benefits are that it shortens recovery from anaemia, shortens hospital stay, reduces the length of follow up, and reduces the period in which patients are vulnerable as a result of their anaemic state (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are risks in blood transfusion: it can cause circulatory overload, transfusion reactions, and occasionally, death (<LINK REF="REF-Ness-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ness 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Garratty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garratty 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Goodnough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodnough 1999</LINK>). There is also the risk of infection with HIV, hepatitis B or other pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sazama-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazama 1994</LINK>). Some experts recommend that patients with severe malarial anaemia who are otherwise clinically stable should be managed conservatively as haemoglobin has been shown to rise rapidly following antimalarial chemotherapy in a remarkable proportion of such cases (<LINK REF="STD-Pape-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Holzer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holzer 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conservative management corresponds with consensus guidelines for severe anaemia of any cause (<LINK REF="REF-ACP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACP 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1989</LINK>). The World Health Organization recommends that red cell transfusion is necessary only if the anaemia is associated with incipient or established cardiac failure (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1989</LINK>). Similarly, the American College of Physicians has recommended that blood transfusion in acute or chronic anaemia should only be given in symptomatic patients who failed to respond to other suitable resuscitative measures (<LINK REF="REF-ACP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACP 1992</LINK>). However some practice audit reports have shown that inappropriate blood transfusion is still common (<LINK REF="STD-Mozes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mozes 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jager-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jager 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ghali-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ghali 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In developing countries, blood transfusion may be further complicated by inadequate supply of donor blood, trained personnel and other basic requirements for good quality care. The potentially harmful effects of blood may be increased in these resource-poor settings since inadequate supervision of laboratory and clinical staff may increase the risk of incorrect cross matching, inadequate screening, poorly given transfusions and badly managed reactions.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to assess the benefits and harms of blood transfusion in severe malarial anaemia from randomised controlled trials. Since the balance of effects could vary depending on age and severity of illness, we intend to stratify the analysis by severity, and to consider sub-group analysis of children, adults and pregnant women.</P>

<P>Children or adults (irrespective of any inherited red blood cell disorders) with severe anaemia and confirmed malaria parasitaemia. Diagnosis of malaria was applied as a criterion for inclusion regardless of the species of malaria parasites.</P>
<P>
<B>Definition of severe anaemia:</B> Although the most widely cited definition of severe anaemia is haematocrit &lt; 15%, the definition of severe anaemia in reviewed literature varied from haematocrit of 13% or less (<LINK REF="STD-Fullerton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Fullerton 1962</LINK>) to &lt; 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Hedberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hedberg 1993</LINK>). Haematocrit &lt; 20% has been adopted as the definition for this review in order to avoid exclusion of many good trials on the basis of haematocrit cut-off points.</P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion of participants with inherited red cell disorders:</B> Indications other than severe anaemia are well recognised in patients with inherited red cell disorders, notably sickle cell anaemia. Patients with those specific indicators would be expected to be excluded from trials strictly designed to determine the effects of blood transfusion in severe malarial anaemia patients who are otherwise stable. It is also possible that some good trials may not consider these disorders as criteria for exclusion. This explanation justifies the inclusion of this category of participants in the review.</P>

<P>We attempted to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).</P>
<P>We used the following search terms for all trial registers and databases: blood transfusion, haemotherapy, anaemia and malaria. The search strategy was further enlarged to include two inherited red cell disorders (sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia) which are commonly associated with severe anaemia in many malarious areas.</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register for relevant trials up to April 2010. Full details of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group methods and the journals hand searched are published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in the section on Collaborative Review Groups.</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 2, 2010). This contains mainly reference information to randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in health care.</P>
<P>We searched the following electronic databases using the search terms in combination with the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration and detailed in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>): MEDLINE (1966 to April 2010); African Index Medicus (1998); EMBASE (1980 to April 2010); and LILACS (La Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Informacion en Ciencias de Salud; www.bireme.br, accessed April 2010).</P>
<P>Organizations and individuals working in the field were contacted, and these included: Medical Research Council, The Gambia; Ifakara Centre (National Institute of Medical Research,Tanzania); Wellcome Groups (Thailand and Vietnam); World Health Organization (Child Health/TDR) and Departments of Paediatrics in malarious areas of Africa, Asia and Pacific.</P>
<P>The reviewers also drew on existing reviews of this topic, and checked the citations of all the trials identified by the above methods.</P>
<P>The review panel and external referees, were asked to check the completeness of the search strategy, and to identify any additional unpublished, ongoing and planned trials.</P>

<P>Anaemia severity was defined as "very severe" for haematocrit (PCV) &lt; 12%, and "moderately severe" for haematocrit = 12-19%. Presence of signs of cardiac failure in severe anaemia was stratified as "very severe" regardless of PCV. This definition is a consensus view based on published studies and personal communication with over twenty experts.</P>
<P>Comparison was between transfused participants and the non-transfused controls. Estimates of effect were assessed using Risk Ratio (RR) or Mean Difference (MD) with 95% Confidence Intervals. A fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis. Where analysis showed evidence of heterogeneity of effectiveness between studies, sub-group analysis was used to explore plausible explanations, including severity of anaemia, age, co-existing morbidity (especially sickle cell anaemia) and variations in the type, speed and mode of blood transfusion.</P>

<P>A total of 42 studies were identified but only two met the inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>').

<P>Participants &#8211; both studies excluded children with PCV &lt; 12%, haemorrhage or features of congestive cardiac failure (eg respiratory distress and gallop rhythm). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Holzer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holzer 1993</LINK>) also excluded patients with temperature &gt; 38 °C while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) excluded those with sickle cell disease or severe malnutrition. The PCV range of participants was 12-17% (<LINK REF="STD-Holzer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holzer 1993</LINK>) and 12% to &lt;15% (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) respectively. This means that both trials exlcuded the "very severe" cases. Sickle cell anaemia patients were excluded from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) while the other trial was unclear regarding the inclusion or exclusion of this category of patients.</P>
<P>Intervention &#8211; A total number of 118 received blood transfusion while 112 did not. Both trials used whole blood for transfusion but the volume transfused was 15ml/kg in one (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) and 20ml/kg in the other trial. Non-transfused participants received oral iron supplements in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) and none in the other trial.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Holzer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holzer 1993</LINK>, all patients received treatment for malaria with chloroquine (25 mg/kg) followed by prophylaxis (5 mg/kg/week). In <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>, a combination of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was used, followed by chemoprophylaxis (weekly Maloprim &#8211; dapsone+pyrimethamine) by the 28th day of follow-up in randomly selected sub-groups of transfused (19) and non-transfused (16) participants.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:57:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These studies were small, and neither study appeared to conceal allocation. The small size means we cannot be sure whether early transfusion improves survival in children with moderate malaria associated with anaemia. Loss to follow up was &gt;10%, which could also bias the results.</P>
<P>The trials did not evaluate the risk of HIV or hepatitis B virus transmission which would require longer term follow up. Clearly in centres where screening is routine this is less of a risk, but these are often fatal infections.</P>
<P>There was also lack of information on patients with sickle cell anaemia since these were excluded from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) and inadequately reported in the other.</P>
<P>There is evidence from one trial that non-transfused children stayed longer in hospital than the transfused. Whether this is a result of arbitrary policies about haemoglobin level at discharge or some other clinical decision is not clear.</P>
<P>The mean value in haematocrit during follow-up was higher in transfused children during the first week but this did not persist. The non-transfused children had clearly higher mean haematocrit in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) but lower mean haematocrit in the other trial by day 28. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1997a</LINK>) gave iron supplements to the non-transfused while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Holzer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holzer 1993</LINK>) gave none and this may explain the more rapid increase in the haematocrit in the former.</P>
<P>Blood transfusion is given for several other reasons than severe anaemia in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Goodnough-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodnough 1999</LINK>). Many of these other indications have been the subject of good clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Koshy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Koshy 1988</LINK>, Lorente 1993, <LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>, Adams 1998, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hebert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hebert 1999</LINK>). However, these important trials do not provide an answer to the question of what the effective and safe standards should be for the use of blood transfusion for severe anaemia in malarious areas. The geographical and epidemiological relevance of this research question lies in the fact that malaria which is the leading cause of severe anaemia in endemic communities can be cured in most cases and recovery from malarial anaemia is known to be rapid following successful chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hombergh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hombergh 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1989</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The data were too limited to explore potential factors modifying effects. However, both studies were conducted in stable endemic malarious areas: the effects of malaria may be more severe in people with little immunity, so transfusion in these groups could potentially be of greater benefit.</P>
<P>We found no information was available on adults. Evidence in these groups are important, especially pregnant women who are also exposed to risk of significantly higher morbidity and mortality from malarial anaemia.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 16:28:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In children living in malarious areas with severe anaemia and no respiratory distress, there is insufficient reliable information to know whether routine administration of blood does more good than harm. </P>
<P>Arguments that blood transfusion helps haematocrit recovery over the subsequent weeks is not supported by evidence from one trial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-15 16:28:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger randomized trials of blood transfusion with death as the primary outcome would be useful. The trials could also evaluate as secondary outcomes: respiratory distress and subsequent need for blood (within the first week); adverse events; increase in haematocrit (up to the 2nd month); duration of hospital stay; re-admission rate; HIV and Hepatitis B virus status (within 3-6 months). A carefully conducted large trial is likely to under-estimate the risk of HIV/HBV transmission, since greater care might be taken to avoid these infections in a trial, compared with routine practice.</P>
<P>Some clinicians believe that it is unethical to conduct studies on children with PCV between 12% and 17%, and believe their clinical judgement is better. We maintain that the best way of assessing this policy is to conduct a randomized controlled trial.</P>
<P>The reviewed trials excluded children with PCV &lt; 12% who did not have signs of heart failure thereby losing information on this category of patients. Subsequent trials should include such patients and make room for sub-group analysis if necessary. A multicentre trial, contributing data to an individual patient data analysis, would help to explore the various factors that might modify effects. Potential sources of heterogeneity are clinical status on admission, age, pregnancy, nutritional status, presence of sickle cell trait or various forms of thalassaemia, and endemicity of malaria.</P>
