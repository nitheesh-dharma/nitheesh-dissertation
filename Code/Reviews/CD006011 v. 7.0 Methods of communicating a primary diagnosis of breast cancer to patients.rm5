<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Ways of communicating to a woman that she has breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>For women to wait for and receive a first diagnosis of breast cancer (primary diagnosis) is an extremely stressful experience. Studies conducted to date suggest that what a woman is told at this time has the potential to influence her sense of well being, the way she copes with the news, how much she remembers of what was discussed (her recall) and her overall level of satisfaction with the encounter. <BR/>The diagnosis of confirmed breast cancer can be delivered in a variety of ways, including face-to-face consultation, telephone consultation, written or audiovisual materials. This information can be given by a range of health professionals, such as general practitioners or specialists. </P>
<P>The present systematic review set out to assess the effectiveness of various methods of communicating a first diagnosis of confirmed breast cancer. The review was particularly interested in how this would impact on what the patient remembered, the satisfaction with the information received, the coping strategies used as a result of the information given and the impact of receiving the information on the patient's quality of life. The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature looking for controlled trials in which women receiving a first diagnosis of breast cancer were randomised to the intervention group. They retrieved 23 original reports of trials for further review but ultimately no trial could be included. A number of the trials focused on communication at the first treatment consultation rather than the method of delivering the diagnosis. In an area that is ethically sensitive, the authors suggest that a review which focuses on the various methods of communication at the first consultation visit may provide useful information as to which methods are more effective and beneficial for this patient group. </P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:38:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face-to-face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:46:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>. The incidence is estimated annually at 1,151,289 new cases (2002) with 410,712 patients dying from the disease each year <LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>. In comparison to western cultures, the incidence of breast cancer is lower in developing countries however as with Western cultures the incidence is continuing to increase annually. </P>
<P>Alongside the increase in breast cancer there is a plethora of literature concerning what women do when they first discover a breast abnormality <LINK REF="REF-Lindop-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindop 2001</LINK>. The anxiety and emotional responses of women whilst waiting for and on receiving a definitive diagnosis is well documented <LINK REF="REF-Fallowfield-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallowfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iwamitsu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwamitsu 2005</LINK> . Little is known however, about women's psychological well-being, coping strategies and recall connected to the method and level of communication used to deliver a primary diagnosis of breast cancer. The initial diagnosis may be given by a variety of professionals, some of whom the patient may never see again. Some studies show that the majority of women perceive a diagnosis of breast cancer as life threatening and impacting on their quality of life <LINK REF="REF-Galloway-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galloway 1997</LINK>. A survey by <LINK REF="REF-Loge-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loge 1996</LINK> involving 497 Norwegian cancer patients revealed that the manner in which the diagnosis was presented limited conversation between physician and patient. These findings are substantiated by a recent Cochrane systematic review which concluded that many people with cancer find it difficult to recall information provided during consultations <LINK REF="REF-Scott-J-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott J 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>A number of studies and reviews have been conducted on methods of communication with cancer patients and their findings support the view that the methods of delivering information has the potential to impact on patient recall and satisfaction. <LINK REF="REF-McPherson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPherson 2001</LINK> conducted a systematic review of the methods of information giving in cancer and concluded that interventions such as written information, audiotapes, audiovisual aids and other interactive medium improved at least one patient related outcome. The Cochrane systematic review assessing interventions for improving communication with children and adolescents about a family member's cancer concluded that many people find it difficult to remember information provided during medical consultations, thus supporting the view that additional communication methods may be necessary. </P>
<P>Current practice is influenced by a number of evidence based clinical practice guidelines. In the United Kingdom the National Institute of Clinical Excellence <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK> guidance on improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer reviewed evidence for communication strategies used at diagnosis of various cancers. This guideline found that various communication interventions impacted differently on outcomes and as such there were inconsistent effects on patient knowledge and levels of satisfaction. The Cochrane Review however showed 90% of patients with cancer found recordings of summaries of their consultation valuable <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2003</LINK>. Similarly, clinical practice guidelines for the provision of psychosocial care of patients with cancer published by the National Breast Cancer Centre and National Cancer Control Initiative <LINK REF="REF-NBCC_x002f_NCCI-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCC/NCCI 2003</LINK> suggested that the patient's understanding, recall and/or satisfaction with care or all three was increased with communication aids. These included provision of a tape of the consultation, sending a summary follow-up letter and / or having a support person to be present during the consultation or both. The evidence to support each method of communication was taken from a single randomised controlled trial.</P>
<P>A thorough systematic review of the evidence surrounding methods of communicating a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women is lacking. The consultation this review refers to is the initial consultation where the patient receives their diagnosis of breast cancer. The aim of this review is therefore to focus on the communication strategies used when delivering the initial diagnosis of breast cancer to patients and to make recommendations for practice and further research based on the findings.</P>

<BR/>(a) We searched the specialised register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group on 7 September 2006. Details of search strategies used by the group for the identification of studies and the procedure used to code references are outlined in the group's module (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/BREASTCA/frame.html">http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/BREASTCA/frame.html</A>). Studies with keywords 'Professional patient relations' , 'interpersonal relations', 'physician patient relations', 'truth disclosure', 'patient participation', 'communication', 'decision making', consultation', 'audiotape', 'verbal', 'written information' or 'telephone' on the specialised register were extracted for consideration.</P>

Google Scholar was substituted as an alternative for searching and locating grey literature. The search terms used for Google Scholar were 'breast cancer' and 'diagnosis' and 'communication'.</P>
<P>(4) References from published studies<BR/>We checked reference lists of all relevant studies. Where necessary we contacted authors of identified studies for further information <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>(5) Handsearching<BR/>Handsearching of journals was not conducted as the key journals are all indexed in the electronic databases searched for this review.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reviewed the results of the searches in three phases. In phase one we reviewed the titles and abstracts of each study for their eligibility. This was done independently by at least two authors. Disagreements over inclusion did not occur but this would have been resolved through discussion with a third author. The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. During phase two we excluded abstracts which were not relevant to the review, for example, there were a large number of abstracts relating to breast screening and treatment options. </P>
<P>We obtained full text articles for abstracts which appeared relevant to the review in the third phase. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review.  Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hack-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK> which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. We had developed a standardised data extraction sheet and intended to use this to record key information for each study such as the indices of quality, the setting, participants, interventions, duration of follow up, attrition rates and results. Grading of allocation concealment and scoring of the randomisation process was to be based on the standardised quality scale proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>. The Consort checklist was used to structure the overall critique of each study <LINK REF="REF-Consort-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consort 2006</LINK>. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:46:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>No RCTs assessing methods of communicating a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women were identified. A total of 2847 potentially relevant studies were identified and screened for retrieval. The majority were excluded at this stage due to the study design or intervention. Only 23 original studies were retrieved for further assessment but none met the criteria for inclusion. Reasons for exclusion are detailed in the table of 'Characteristics of excluded studies' .</P>
<P>Of the studies reviewed 20 were excluded as they did not focus on method of communication at the time of diagnosis, and a further three studies were not RCTs. A number of the excluded studies were concerned with communication at first treatment consultation rather than the method of delivering the diagnosis <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lobb 2002</LINK>. These studies investigated a variety of approaches to communication which included providing audiotapes of treatment consultations <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lobb 2002</LINK> and the use of a prompt sheet to facilitate communication between patient and doctor <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2003</LINK>. The provision of audiotapes of the consultation demonstrated a significantly greater level of recall and satisfaction with information <LINK REF="STD-Hack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hack-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hack 2003</LINK>. The use of prompt sheets to encourage patient participation during consultations was found to significantly increase the amount of questions asked regarding tests and treatment and the amount of prognostic information provided to patients. Findings from these studies would indicate that patients find such interventions helpful for recall of information but satisfaction with communication, mood state or quality of life may not be significantly influenced. This supports the findings of the Cochrane systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Scott-J-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott J 2003</LINK>. </P>
<P>Three further studies focussed on the psychological adjustment to a diagnosis of breast cancer <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowery-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lowery 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mager-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mager 2002</LINK> and two studies reported findings of video taped simulated consultations of delivering the diagnosis and assessed the reactions and preferred styles by participants <LINK REF="STD-Dowsett-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsett 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mast-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mast 2005</LINK>. The findings of the latter two studies suggest that participants preferred a patient centred approach to consultations, particularly when the prognosis is poor. These findings have implications for the design of future studies. <BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review found no RCTs assessing methods for communicating a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. Our search strategy included a comprehensive search of electronic databases and we also contacted key authors for further information. </P>
<P>Although no RCTs were identified, findings from previous studies and reviews which have been conducted on methods of communicating with cancer patients, generally support the view that the method of delivering information has the potential to influence a number of factors such as patient recall and satisfaction. Some of the findings also suggest that a patient centred approach to communication was favoured. </P>
<P>The lack of relevant studies for this review have however, highlighted the possible ethical issues related to obtaining informed consent from women before they have a confirmed diagnosis. The reviewers consider that at a time of possible heightened anxiety for women awaiting a diagnosis, it is unlikely that approaching them to take part in an RCT would gain ethical approval. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We are unable to recommend implications for practice based on this review. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice.</P>
