<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-13 07:21:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We looked at studies until November 2013 on the effect of receiving methotrexate alone compared to placebo (no treatment) over 12 to 52 weeks in 732 people with rheumatoid arthritis.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>In the short term treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate:</P>
<P>- improves pain, function and other symptoms;</P>
<P>- probably reduces joint damage as seen on the x-ray.</P>
<P>Precise information about side effects and complications was not always available. Common side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, stomach pain, and sores on lips, mouth or throat. Rare complications may include birth defects, kidney, lung and liver problems.</P>
<P>
<B>What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is methotrexate?</B>
</P>
<P>When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints making your joints swollen, stiff and painful.<BR/>Treatments aim to decrease symptoms and improve your ability to move.</P>
<P>Methotrexate is one of a group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and it is the most common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate helps prevent further permanent damage that can happen if rheumatoid arthritis is not treated.</P>
<P>
<B>What happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate alone?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability)</B>
<BR/>- 15 more people out of 100 experienced major improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis after 12 months with methotrexate when compared to placebo (15% absolute improvement).<BR/>- 23 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone experienced major improvement.<BR/>- 8 people out of 100 who took a placebo experienced major improvement.</P>
<P>
<B>Remission or absence of active disease</B>
</P>
<P>In people who took either placebo or methotrexate, none had absence of active disease.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Disability (lower scores mean lower disability)</B>
</P>
<P>- People who took methotrexate rated their disability to be 0.27 points lower on a scale of 0 to 3 after 3 to 12 months with methotrexate when compared to placebo (9% absolute improvement).<BR/>- People who took methotrexate rated their disability to be between 0.39 and 1.04.<BR/>- People who took placebo rated their disability to be between 0.53 and 1.34.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life - physical component (ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better)</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>- 12 more people out of 100 perceived their ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better after 12 months with methotrexate alone compared to placebo (12% absolute improvement).<BR/>- 39 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone perceived their ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better.<BR/>- 27 people out of 100 who took a placebo perceived their ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life - mental component</B>
</P>
<P>- 5 more people out of 100 perceived their mental well-being better after 12 months with methotrexate alone compared to placebo (5% absolute improvement).<BR/>- 26 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone perceived their mental well-being better.<BR/>- 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo perceived their mental well-being better.</P>
<P>
<B>X-rays of the joints</B>
<BR/>- 8 more people out of 100 had less x-ray damage to joints measured by increase in erosion scores of more than 3 units on a scale ranging from 0 to 448 in people who took methotrexate compared to placebo after 12 months (8% absolute reduction).<BR/>- 4 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone had increased damage to joints measured by x-ray.<BR/>-12 people out of 100 who took a placebo had increase damage to joints measured by x-ray.</P>
<P>
<B>Discontinuations due to adverse events (side effects and complications)</B>
<BR/>- 9 more people out of 100 discontinued methotrexate due to adverse events after 3 to 12 months compared to placebo (9% absolute withdrawals).<BR/>- 16 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone discontinued methotrexate due to adverse events.<BR/>- 8 people out of 100 who took a placebo discontinued placebo due to adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Serious adverse events</B>
<BR/>- 1 more person out of 100 experienced serious side effects after 3 to 12 months with methotrexate alone compared to placebo (1% absolute harm).<BR/>- 3 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone experienced serious side effects.<BR/>- 2 people out of 100 who took a placebo experienced serious side effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-14 14:11:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. Methotrexate inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins by binding to dihydrofolate reductase. Currently, methotrexate is among the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is an update of the previous Cochrane systematic review published in 1997.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-05-14 14:47:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate short term benefits and harms of methotrexate for treating RA compared to placebo.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-05-14 14:47:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1966 to 1997 and then updated to November 2013. The search was complemented with a bibliography search of the reference lists of trials retrieved from the electronic search.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-05-12 07:15:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy against placebo alone in people with RA. Any trial duration and MTX doses were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-05-12 07:15:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently determined which studies were eligible for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were pooled using mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables or standardized mean differences (SMDs) when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. Pooled risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous variables. Fixed-effect models were used throughout, although random-effects models were used for outcomes showing heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-02 05:51:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials with 300 patients were included in the original version of the review. An additional two trials with 432 patients were added to the 2013 update of the review for a total of 732 participants. The trials were generally of unclear to low risk of bias with a follow-up duration ranging from 12 to 52 weeks. All trials included patients who have failed prior treatment (for example, gold therapy, D-penicillamine, azathioprine or anti-malarials); mean disease duration that ranged between 1 and 14 years with six trials reporting more than 4 years; and weekly doses that ranged between 5 mg and 25 mg.</P>
<P>
<B>Benefits</B>
</P>
<P>Statistically significant and clinically important differences were observed for most efficacy outcomes. MTX monotherapy showed a clinically important and statistically significant improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate when compared with placebo at 52 weeks (RR 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 6.0; number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI 4 to 22). Fifteen more patients out of 100 had a major improvement in the ACR 50 outcome compared to placebo (absolute treatment benefit (ATB) 15%, 95% CI 8% to 23%).</P>
<P>Statistically significant improvement in physical function (scale of 0 to 3) was also observed in patients receiving MTX alone compared with placebo at 12 to 52 weeks (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.16; odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% CI 0.23 to 32.2; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 7). Nine more patients out of 100 improved in physical function compared to placebo (ATB -9%, 95% CI -13% to -5.3%). Similarly, the proportion of patients who improved at least 20% on the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component was higher in the MTX-treated group compared with placebo at 52 weeks (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1; NNT 9, 95% CI 4 to 539). Twelve more patients out of 100 showed an improvement of at least 20% in the physical component of the quality of life measure compared to placebo (ATB 12%, 95% CI 1% to 24%). No clinically important or statistically significant differences were observed in the SF-36 mental component.</P>
<P>Although no statistically significant differences were observed in radiographic scores (that is, Total Sharp score, erosion score, joint space narrowing), radiographic progression rates (measured by an increase in erosion scores of more than 3 units on a scale ranging from 0 to 448) were statistically significantly lower for patients in the MTX group compared with placebo-treated patients (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86; NNT 13, 95% CI 10 to 60). Eight more patients out of 100 showed less damage to joints measured by an increase in erosion scores compared to placebo (ATB -8%, 95% CI -16% to -1%). In the one study measuring remission, no participants in either group met the remission criteria. These are defined by at least five of (&#8805; 2 months): morning stiffness of &lt; 15 minutes, no fatigue, no joint pain by history, no joint tenderness, no joint swelling, and Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of &lt; 20 mm/hr in men and &lt; 30 mm/hr in women.</P>
<P>
<B>Harms</B>
</P>
<P>Patients in the MTX monotherapy group were twice as likely to discontinue from the study due to adverse events compared to patients in the placebo group, at 12 to 52 weeks (16% versus 8%; RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.3; NNT 13, 95% CI 6 to 44). Compared to placebo, nine more people out of 100 who took MTX withdrew from the studies because of side effects (ATB 9%, 95% CI 3% to 14%). Total adverse event rates at 12 weeks were higher in the MTX monotherapy group compared to the placebo group (45% versus 15%; RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.4; NNT 4, 95% CI 2 to 17). Thirty more people out of 100 who took MTX compared to those who took placebo experienced any type of side effect (common or rare) (ATB 30, 95% CI 13% to 47%). No statistically significant differences were observed in the total number of serious adverse events between the MTX group and the placebo group at 27 to 52 weeks. Three people out of 100 who took MTX alone experienced rare but serious side effects compared to 2 people out of 100 who took a placebo (3% versus 2%, respectively).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-13 07:01:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on mainly moderate to high quality evidence, methotrexate (weekly doses ranging between 5 mg and 25 mg) showed a substantial clinical and statistically significant benefit compared to placebo in the short term treatment (12 to 52 weeks) of people with RA, although its use was associated with a 16% discontinuation rate due to adverse events.</P>

Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We assessed the risk of bias according to several domains including: a) random sequence generation, b) allocation concealment, c) blinding of participants and personnel, d) blinding of outcome assessment, e) incomplete outcome data, f) selective outcome reporting, g) other bias (that is, baseline imbalance). We graded each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear and provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgement in the 'Risk of bias' table.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-05-13 08:18:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dichotomous data were analysed as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also estimated. Continuous data were pooled as mean differences (MD) with corresponding 95% CI or standardized mean differences (SMD) in the case of joint scores, pain, global and functional assessments. This was necessary because of the variation in the outcome measures included in each study (for example, different number of swollen joints counted). Trial results were entered into RevMan using the same direction in order to enable the pooling of results, with the lower values indicating better responses. Negative values in SMD indicated a benefit of the active drug over placebo. The SMD was back-translated to a typical scale (for example, 0 to 10 for pain) by multiplying the SMD by a typical among-person standard deviation (for example, the standard deviation of the control group at baseline from the most representative trial) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-05-13 08:21:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Authors from two trials were contacted to obtain missing numerical outcome data, but no response was obtained. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the effect estimate based on the number of patients analysed at the final visit. If the number of patients analysed was not presented, the number reported at baseline was used. When only median and interquartile ranges were reported, the median was used as the mean and one half of the difference between the first and third quartile range was used as the standard deviation. When the end-of-trial standard deviation was not reported we used the baseline standard deviation for the pooled analysis. In our experience, the baseline standard deviation of RA outcome measures is often very close to the end-of-trial standard deviation, perhaps slightly larger. This resultant bias would therefore result in decreased weighting of the studies and is preferable to completely excluding them. If no standard deviation was provided at baseline, missing standard deviations were computed from other statistics such as standard errors or imputed from other studies in the meta-analysis. When numerical data were only reported graphically, the value was extracted from the graph.</P>

<B>Participants:</B> 542 (74%) patients were females. The mean age of patients ranged from 46 to 60 years. Patients were at least 16 years old and met the ACR criteria for RA. Except for <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1998</LINK>, the population in most trials included in the review had severe RA of long duration (mean disease duration ranged from 4.8 to 14 years) and a high prevalence of positive rheumatoid factor (RF). All participants had previously failed other second-line agents (DMARD) therapy including gold therapy, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, sulphasalazine, and anti-malarials. Most were allowed concurrent use of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Common exclusion criteria included active liver disease, history of malignancy, history of renal disease, and presence of other arthritic conditions.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions:</B> 415 patients received methotrexate monotherapy and 302 received matching placebo. An additional 15 patients in <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1985</LINK> received both methotrexate and matching placebo at different points of time during the study (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Methotrexate was administered orally in six studies and intramuscularly (IM) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1985</LINK>). Doses ranged between 5 mg and 25 mg per week. In <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1985</LINK> 0.2 ml to 1 ml of normal saline was used as placebo. In the remaining trials matching placebo was used with no proper mention about the type of placebo.</P>

<B>Duration:</B> the duration of the trials ranged between 12 and 52 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1985</LINK> patients were evaluated every 3 weeks beginning at 5 weeks and then at 8 weeks and 11 weeks. Cross-over occurred at 14 weeks followed by evaluation at 18, 21, 24 and 27 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Furst-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Furst 1989</LINK> patients entered in a 12-day in-patient period and, after randomisation efficacy assessment, were assessed every 4 weeks at 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 weeks.

<P>
<B>Outcomes:</B> generally the trials included most of the OMERACT outcome measures. Reported efficacy outcomes included swollen and tender joint count, swollen and tender joint index, physician global assessment of disease activity, walking time, grip strength, ESR and CRP. Most studies were conducted between 1985 and 1993, before any definitions of improvement were published, thus only one study published in 1999 reported data on the percent of people improving using the ACR core set (<LINK REF="STD-Strand-1999-_x0028_ULTRA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1999 (ULTRA)</LINK>). Patient-reported outcomes included pain, patient global assessment, morning stiffness, health-related quality of life, and functional status measured by ADL, modified HAQ and HAQ disability index. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> depicts the scales used for each type of outcome measure.

<I>Total adverse events</I>: patients in the methotrexate group were more likely to have any type of adverse event compared with the placebo group (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.4). In the placebo group 15 people out of 100 had adverse events over 12 to 18 weeks, compared to 45 (95% CI 21 to 95) out of 100 for the methotrexate group (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Serious adverse events</I>: only 2% to 3% of the patients withdrew from the studies at 27 to 52 weeks due to serious adverse events (2% placebo, 3% methotrexate). There was only one study with one death reported in the methotrexate group caused by sepsis, but it was not clear if this was attributed to the drug. No statistically significant differences between groups were observed in the proportion of patients with serious adverse events at 27 to 52 weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Statistically significant adverse events</I>: patients who received methotrexate were more likely to have an infection when compared to patients who received placebo, at 12 to 52 weeks (49% versus 35%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.6) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.18</LINK>). The most common infections were: upper respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia. Rates of any type of liver enzyme abnormalities were higher in the methotrexate-treated group compared to the placebo-treated group at 12 to 52 weeks (15% versus 3%; RR 4.8, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.0) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.19</LINK>). Stomatitis and oral ulcers at 12 to 18 weeks were more likely to be reported in the methotrexate group compared to the placebo group (9% versus 4%; RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.0) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.28</LINK>). Also, alopecia and gastrointestinal distress rates were higher in the methotrexate group compared to the placebo group at 12 to 52 weeks (6% versus 1% (<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>) and 9% versus 4% (<LINK REF="CMP-005.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.14</LINK>), respectively).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-13 10:08:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methotrexate was initially used for the treatment of RA in 1951 (<LINK REF="REF-Gubner-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubner 1951</LINK>). Since then, several open studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) have suggested beneficial effects. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate for the treatment of people with RA when compared to placebo. We only included in this review placebo controlled CCTs and RCTs reporting results after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment. The dosage of methotrexate in these trials ranged from 7.5 to 25 mg per week.</P>
<P>Substantial differences between placebo and methotrexate were observed for measures of disease activity, in favour of methotrexate. These differences were clinically important and statistically significant for various efficacy and patient-reported outcomes and structural damage measures. The standardized weighted differences between methotrexate and placebo for the various outcome measures varied between -0.43 and -1.2. These effects can be considered to be substantial. The minimum effect size considered to be clinically meaningful in RA has been estimated at 0.30 (<LINK REF="REF-Kazis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazis 1989</LINK>). The absolute treatment benefit (ATB) to achieve an ACR20 response was 20% and for an ACR50 was 15% with a NNT of 6 and 7, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in the overall number of withdrawals and dropouts, but methotrexate participants were statistically significantly more likely to discontinue treatment because of adverse reactions, specifically liver enzyme abnormalities and placebo participants because of lack of response. The most frequent side effects with methotrexate were infections, raised liver enzymes and stomatitis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-13 10:14:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two new studies were included for this update (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1999-_x0028_ULTRA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1999 (ULTRA)</LINK>. However, most studies were conducted between 1985 and 1993, before any definitions of improvement were published, thus only one study published in 1999 (<LINK REF="STD-Strand-1999-_x0028_ULTRA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1999 (ULTRA)</LINK>) reported data on the per cent of people improving using the ACR core set. Evidence on radiographic outcomes was also derived from the same unique study (<LINK REF="STD-Strand-1999-_x0028_ULTRA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1999 (ULTRA)</LINK>), which showed statistically significant delay in progression with methotrexate. This trial used state of the art study design and recommended outcome measures for trials in RA (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OMERACT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">OMERACT 1993</LINK>). This updated review provides confirmatory evidence of the benefit of methotrexate at weekly doses of 5 to 25 mg for patients with RA. The trials included in this review used similar inclusion criteria and the participant populations had longstanding severe RA (more than 4 years), were often seropositive, and had failed previous DMARDs (for example, gold therapy, D-penicillamine, anti-malarials). Despite the severity of the disease, the improvement was substantial. Both cross-over trials reported a failure in the disease state after discontinuation of methotrexate, which suggests that the drug has to be continued to maintain the benefit. The long term effectiveness or safety profile of methotrexate cannot be established with this review.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-13 10:17:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> shows the overall quality of evidence. Evidence quality was mainly moderate to high with one outcome, remission, being graded as low quality. Statistically significant heterogeneity among trials was observed for various outcome measures. The heterogeneity remained significant with random-effects models. As expected, random-effects model pooling resulted in larger confidence intervals than those obtained from fixed-effect models. Nevertheless, most efficacy outcome measures remained statistically significant. The reasons for heterogeneity are not apparent but are not likely to relate to the RA populations in the trials since participants were quite similar, having longstanding and severe RA. More likely, differences may have resulted from the various methods used to estimate these outcomes, which requires standardization. For instance, global assessments were measured in different trials with Likert scales or visual analogue scales (VAS).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-05-13 10:21:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A strength of this review is the electronic search strategy using the latest methodology. All important databases were searched, including trial registers. Two trials used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1985</LINK>). Because of how the data were reported, we used the final results for the first arm, which was provided only in <LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1985</LINK>. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pinheiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pinheiro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1985</LINK>) we used the baseline standard deviation to pool the results. This procedure may have created some bias. It was similarly applied to both groups (treatment and control) and the overall impact on the estimation of differences between groups is probably small. Moreover, this bias is expected to result in decreased weighting of these studies, which was preferable, in our view, to excluding the trials.</P>

<P>Clinical practice guidelines recommend methotrexate to be used as a first DMARD in the majority of patients with RA (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smolen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smolen 2013</LINK>). Other published meta-analyses have reported similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 1992</LINK>) but the studies included in these reviews did not include state of the art study design nor used the patient responder analyses as recommended by OMERACT (as reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1999-_x0028_ULTRA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1999 (ULTRA)</LINK> study). These systematic reviews also concluded that methotrexate has a better benefit-harm ratio compared to other alternatives. Furthermore, methotrexate has been proven to be effective even if re-employed after previous failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kapral-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapral 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Long term extensions of clinical trials have reported similar findings (<LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1998</LINK> found that after 11 years of receiving methotrexate monotherapy only 11% of 26 patients discontinued due to toxicity. <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1985</LINK> evaluated 21 patients for five years and only two discontinued therapy due to gastrointestinal toxicity. In the TEMPO trial after three years of methotrexate exposure in 228 patients, non-infectious serious adverse events were reported in 23% of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heijde-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heijde 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, a systematic review of 2008 to 2012 literature that was conducted for the Italian clinical recommendations for the use of methotrexate in rheumatic diseases found evidence suggesting that discontinuation rates due to toxicity are similar to those in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or leflunomide, and lower than those in patients receiving gold salts or sulphasalazine (<LINK REF="REF-Todoerti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todoerti 2013</LINK>). The most frequent adverse events reported in the 70 included studies were gastrointestinal and liver toxicity, especially during the first five years. The discontinuation rate due to hepatotoxicity is about 5%. Nonetheless, a recently updated Cochrane review has found that when supplemented with folic acid, methotrexate side effects can be reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Shea-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shea-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although, the long term effectiveness or safety profile of methotrexate cannot be established with this review, time trend analyses indicate that methotrexate monotherapy has a two-year drug survival (<LINK REF="REF-Aga-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aga 2013</LINK>). Methotrexate continues to be the most prescribed drug for the treatment of RA. This review provides the centrepiece evidence to further compare the effects of methotrexate as the standard of care to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (traditional or biologic), monotherapy or combinations in network meta-analyses.</P>

<P>The three major changes from the original version were the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the first publication of this review, pooled odds ratios (OR) for withdrawals and toxicity were estimated using Peto's method (<LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1994</LINK>). However, in most of the analyses the criteria for using this method were not fulfilled, therefore we have used RR. The RR estimate is very similar to the OR in rare outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Toxicity was analysed for total withdrawals from adverse reactions, and withdrawals for system-specific side effects.</LI>
<LI>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a quality scale validated and published by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>. This scale includes an assessment of randomization, double-blinding procedures and description of withdrawals. The possible range of scores is 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Three studies had a score of 5 and the other two a score of 4. For this update all studies have been assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1985</LINK> was removed from the efficacy analyses because the authors did not provide separate data for period 1 (before cross-over) of the study.</LI>
<LI>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Furst-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Furst 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinheiro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pinheiro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1999-_x0028_ULTRA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1999 (ULTRA)</LINK>) assessed patient functional status through ADL, HAQ disability index and modified HAQ, respectively. In the original review, functional status was analysed combining two studies reporting data on ADL and HAQ. For the update, a separate analysis was performed for each instrument.</LI>
