<TITLE>No evidence to suggest tamoxifen benefits patients with relapsed ovarian cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Ovarian cancer often spreads before symptoms show. Cytotoxic drugs are often only partly effective and cause severe side-effects. The main aims of treatment for relapsed disease are symptom control and prolongation of life. No data from RCTs or non-RCTs were found, so there was no evidence that tamoxifen was effective and safe as a treatment for relapsed ovarian cancer. Laboratory studies suggest tamoxifen may be effective as a treatment for women with ovarian cancer. Although, uncontrolled non-comparative trials on patients with relapsed ovarian cancer showed tamoxifen may shrink or stabilise tumours in a small number, there is a strong need for an RCT or good quality non-randomised comparative studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of tamoxifen in terms of overall survival, tumour response, symptom control, quality of life and adverse events.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Tamoxifen is an important drug for treating breast cancer. Ovarian cancer cells are known to possess receptors for hormones and may thus also respond to tamoxifen.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer in women whose tumours have oestrogen receptors. Since ovarian cancers also commonly have oestrogen receptors, it has been suggested that tamoxifen may be of some benefit. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of tamoxifen in women with relapsed ovarian cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:51:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 1, 2009. Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE from 2002 to April 2009, EMBASE from 2002 to April 2009. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of review articles and contacted experts in the field, as well as drugs companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and non-randomised studies of tamoxifen in women with ovarian cancer who have not responded to conventional chemotherapy. Only trials involving 10 or more patients were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:37:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The search strategy identified 1392 unique references of which 1360 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. The remaining 32 articles were retrieved in full, but none satisfied the inclusion criteria. Only observational data from single arm studies of women treated with tamoxifen were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We are unable to make any evidence-based recommendations as we found no comparative studies assessing the effectiveness of tamoxifen in women with recurrent ovarian cancer. There is limited evidence on anti-tumour activity from phase 2 studies, but these contain no data on the effect of tamoxifen on symptom control, QOL or the prolongation of life.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-08 11:40:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-08 11:40:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-02-08 11:40:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Ovarian cancer causes more deaths from cancer than the other types of gynaecological cancer and is the sixth most common cancer among women. A woman's cumulative risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 65 years is 0.5%: 0.4% in less developed countries and 0.7% in more developed countries. It is less common in women under the age of 35 years, and its incidence increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2002</LINK>). In Europe, just over a third of women with ovarian cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>), largely because most patients present with advanced disease that is widespread within the abdominal cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>). At present there is no effective screening method. The other key factor explaining the poor recurrence and death rate is the relative lack of effectiveness of drug therapy for advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-AOCTG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">AOCTG 1991</LINK>). Despite the introduction of taxanes and other new cytotoxic agents most patients with advanced ovarian cancer still relapse and die. Because of this there has been the need for new treatments and for drugs that may be useful for arresting ovarian cancer that is no longer responsive to conventional drugs. In this situation treatments that lack significant side-effects are very desirable.</P>
<P>Ovarian cancer cells have been shown to possess surface receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and androgen and that in vitro responses to tamoxifen and other hormonal agents occur (<LINK REF="REF-Gronroos-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gronroos 1983</LINK>). Tamoxifen is routinely used to treat breast cancer with response rates of 50 to 60% in those women whose tumours possess oestrogen receptors.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Tamoxifen is an oral agent that has been one of the most important drugs in the management of breast cancer over the past 40 years. It is given as a simple single tablet daily. It blocks the activity of oestrogen at oestrogen receptors in cancer cells and possesses weak oestrogenic activity of its own. It's most important adverse effect if the induction of hyperplasia of the endometrium of the womb, which in some patients may progress to invasive cancer. This is due to its weak agonistic action. However, many patients with ovarian cancer will have had a hysterectomy as part of their treatment. Tamoxifen also increases the risk of venous thrombosis. The risk from both these serious side effects is low (in the order of a few percent). Subjective side effects are usually not severe and most patients will tolerate long term use of tamoxifen. The current recommendation is for 5 years adjuvant therapy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-02-01 17:24:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since ovarian cancers commonly possess oestrogen receptors, trials have been carried out to see if tamoxifen is also active in this type of cancer. An effective drug that has few major side-effects would be very helpful, either as a treatment for advanced disease or as an adjuvant following surgery, with or without chemotherapy.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-01-28 14:52:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The aim was to review all comparative studies of tamoxifen in women with advanced and recurrent ovarian carcinoma which has failed conventional cytotoxic drugs. The review was designed to find out if tamoxifen could cause useful regression of advanced ovarian cancer and through this have a palliative effect.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We did not identify any studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of tamoxifen in relapsed ovarian cancer. The majority of studies appear to have been designed as single arm studies aiming to assess whether tamoxifen can induce response in ovarian cancer and the study designs did not allow assessment of the effect of tamoxifen on symptom control, quality of life and prolongation of survival. </P>
<P>The following questions remain unanswered. 1) Whether hormone receptor status is useful in selecting patients for tamoxifen in recurrent ovarian cancer. 2) Are certain histological subtypes of ovarian cancer more likely to respond than others? Can tamoxifen improve survival, symptom control and quality of life?</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The studies identified provided no data to answer the key question posed by the review. This was whether tamoxifen provided useful palliation in this group of women with advanced ovarian cancer. Although phase 2 studies have shown a potential for tumour response, no definite judgement can be about this. There were no data from the studies to say whether women with ovarian cancer had measurable benefit. There are too few patients in multiple small studies, which makes it difficult to answer subsidiary questions, such as identifying who is most likely to benefit. Where such studies were done, definitions used varied across studies. Tamoxifen remains in clinical use; mainly when clinicians have exhausted all reasonable chemotherapy options and wish to consider a simple oral, relatively non toxic treatment. From the results of non-comparative single arm tamoxifen studies it is likely that some patients will respond, but it is not clear whether or not there will be any clinical benefit.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, so no evidence was found. Limited data from non-comparative studies were available. The response rates seen vary greatly from study to study, possibly due to patient selection and varying assessment of response. </P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature and all studies were sifted and data extracted by two reviewers independently. We were not restrictive in our inclusion criteria with regards to types of studies as we planned to include non-randomised studies with concurrent comparisons groups as we suspected that we would not find any relevant RCTs. Therefore we attempted to ensure that we did not overlook any relevant evidence by searching a wide range of reasonable quality non-randomised study designs (case-control studies and case series of fewer than 10 patients were excluded).</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as we did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:59:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>See table of results: <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> which show the crude objective response and stable disease rates in phase 2 studies.</P>
<P>The only data that could be examined in this review were the response rates in the various non-comparative studies. All presented objective responses (defined as complete and partial, presumably according to standard criteria - though this definition was usually not available). Some, in addition, reported the numbers of patients who had stable disease. In some studies the duration of stable disease, required to define this criteria was given (this varied), whilst in others this information was not presented.</P>
<P>Overall, 60 of 623 patients (9.6%) responded objectively, using the criteria in the various trials. In those studies recording stable disease (a minimal definition is no evidence of a greater than 25% increase or more than a 50% decrease in the cross sectional area of the cancer lasting for at least one month), 131 of 411 patients (31.9%) had stable disease, as defined in the trials. There was marked heterogeneity in the objective response rates (0 - 56%) and disease stabilisation rates (0 to 83%). This may reflect both different selection criteria for patients included in the trials and different criteria of response or application of these criteria. The measurement of response in ovarian carcinoma is notoriously difficult. The inclusion of stable disease may be helpful in this situation, stable disease in response to hormone therapy in breast cancer appears meaningful. However, the data on stable disease in this review may not be robust since assessment of response is difficult and duration of stability may have been short. Most studies did not report CA 125 measurements (a protein associated with active ovarian cancer), which might have helped define stable disease more clearly. In addition, not all trials reported the stable disease rate (it is not a standard definition of response), leaving the possibility that there was a bias for trials with a high disease stabilisation rate to report this data and for those with low stabilisation rates not to report it. The duration of stable disease defined in some studies was as short as four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Marth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marth 1997</LINK>) and lack of progression of more than 25% of the cross-sectional area of any cancer in one month may not represent true stable disease. Despite this, achievement of stable disease in this setting may be useful since a number of trials reported cases where stable disease lasted for a number of years. However, the significance of such results is unclear in small trials where there is no comparator and no independent assessment of response.</P>
<P>In the Marth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Marth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marth 1997</LINK>) it was reported that responses were seen significantly more often in endometrioid cancers and that no responses were seen in clear cell cancers. However, the numbers were small in each of these groups and it is not clear whether this was a pre-specified sub-group analysis. They also found that young age at presentation and lower initial FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage disease were independent prognostic variables and that these patients were more likely to respond, though once again it is not clear whether these were pre-specified analyses.</P>
<P>A number of trials (<LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holt-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Holt 1979</LINK> ;<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Jawdeh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Jawdeh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Anderl 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beecham-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Beecham 1988</LINK>) reported on the prognostic significance of the presence of hormone receptors in the tumour. The results were heterogeneous and there was no consensus that hormone receptor status could be used as a predictor of response to subsequent tamoxifen therapy. The quality and small size of the trials was inadequate for a review to draw any useful conclusions on the prognostic significance of the presence of hormone receptors when using tamoxifen.</P>
<P>This review gives no evidence to support the use of tamoxifen in recurrent and refractory ovarian carcinoma as we did not find any studies that were relevant to our inclusion criteria. Even in the non-comparative studies there was no definitive information predicting which patients were likely to respond, although Marth (<LINK REF="STD-Marth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marth 1997</LINK>) found that endometrioid patients were significantly more likely to respond and that there were no responses in a small group with clear cell cancers. These analyses do not appear to have been pre-specified and are also unreliable as the study did not have a comparison group. Those trials that did include measurement of hormone receptors found no correlation with the presence of such receptors and response to tamoxifen. Although there was an anecdotal suggestion that trials likely to have the highest rates of chemotherapy refractory patients had the lowest response rates, there were no clear data to substantiate this. Of interest, however, is the high objective response rate in the group of previously untreated patients in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gennatas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gennatas 1996</LINK>). In the absence of good quality comparative studies we can only speculate the efficacy of tamoxifen for relapsed ovarian cancer.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We are unable to make any evidence-based recommendations as we found no comparative studies assessing tamoxifen for women with recurrent ovarian cancer<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>There were no data, from any of the sifted references, that help in selecting those most likely to respond, or on whether the presence of hormone receptors is a useful criteria to predict response. Although the data in phase 2 studies do not corroborate the hypothesis, tamoxifen may be active in those patients who are not yet truly refractory to a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents. Tamoxifen is generally well tolerated and is usually less toxic than the alternatives in patients who have failed routine chemotherapy, but there is no evidence about its effectiveness.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-04 11:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Ideally, a large randomised controlled trial is needed to compare tamoxifen and best supportive care or another medical intervention for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. However, if such a trial is not possible then it is important to conduct well designed non-randomised studies that use multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline imbalances.</P>
<P>In the absence of reliable data, it is unclear whether tamoxifen could be considered for the management of relapsed ovarian carcinoma. The inclusion criteria, dose and schedule and method of assessment of response in phase 2 studies has been very variable. In addition, the single arm studies failed to measure whether tamoxifen is a useful palliative agent. A new generation of trials is needed to try to define more clearly whether tamoxifen is a useful palliative therapy. It would seem appropriate to avoid trials that only accrue patients who are truly refractory to cytotoxic drugs. If such trials show that tamoxifen does possess useful activity in ovarian carcinoma, there might be a role for new RCTs testing the effect of using tamoxifen in conjunction with cytotoxic chemotherapy or as an adjuvant therapy.</P>
