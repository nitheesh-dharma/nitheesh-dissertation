<P>The liver produces bile which has many functions including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year. The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolourisation of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ which secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for people with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis (inflammation) of the gallbladder is one of the indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis can occur suddenly, with symptoms such as fever along with intense pain in the right upper tummy. This is called acute cholecystitis. In comparison, chronic cholecystitis is a smouldering inflammation of the gallbladder which presents with less intense pain in the right upper tummy. For many years, surgeons have preferred to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy once the inflammation settles down completely (which usually takes about six weeks) because of the fear of higher complication rates including injury to the bile duct (a tube through which the bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel). Injury to the bile duct is a life-threatening condition which requires urgent corrective operation in most instances. In spite of the corrective surgery, people have poor quality of life several years after the operation due to repeated instances of bile infection caused by obstruction to the flow of bile into the small bowel. Another reason for the surgeons' preference for delaying the operation is to avoid an open operation, as there has been a perception that early operation increases the risk of an open operation. However, delaying the surgery exposes the people to the risk of complications related to gallstones. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within seven days of people presenting to doctors with symptoms) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after the initial admission). A systematic search of medical literature was performed in order to identify studies which provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.</P>
<P>Six trials providing information on the review question were identified. A total of 488 people with acute cholecystitis were included. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed early (within seven days of people presenting to the doctor with symptoms) in 244 people while it was performed after at least six weeks in the remaining 244 people. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. All the trials were at high risk of bias (and might have overestimated the benefits or underestimated the harms of either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). All the people included in the trials were discharged home alive after operation in the five trials from which this information was available. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury, surgical complications, or who required conversion from key-hole to open operation between the two groups. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups. Only one trial reported the time taken for employed people to return to work. The people belonging to the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group returned to work 11 days, on average, earlier than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Four trials did not report any gallstone-related complications during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone-related complications, including two people with cholangitis. There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone-related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trial. Approximately one-sixth of people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. Based on information from a varied number of participants as well as trials at high risk of bias, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis appears safe and shortens the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely and hence one cannot rule out that future trials may show that one treatment or another may be better in terms of complications. However, the trial size required to show such differences involves a clinical trial on more than 50,000 people and so it is unlikely that such large trials will be performed. Several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta-analyses.</P>

<P>Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone-related complications.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-16 09:49:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-25 12:46:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta-analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD -4.12 days; 95% CI -5.22 to -3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD -1.22 minutes; 95% CI -3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD -11.00 days; 95% CI -19.61 to -2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone-related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone-related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone-related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-11 19:55:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta-analyses.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-11 15:28:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>About 5% to 25% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). The annual incidence of gallstones is about 1 in 200 people (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>). Only 2% to 4% of people with gallstones become symptomatic with biliary colic (pain), acute cholecystitis (inflammation), obstructive jaundice, or gallstone pancreatitis in a year (<LINK REF="REF-Attili-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attili 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Acute cholecystitis involves inflammation of the gallbladder while biliary colic does not involve inflammation of the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy (removal of gallstones) is the preferred option in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Strasberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasberg 1993</LINK>). Every year, 1.5 million cholecystectomies are performed in the US and 60,000 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HES-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2011</LINK>). Approximately 80% of the cholecystectomies are performed laparoscopically (by key-hole surgery) (<LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>). A third of the people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy undergo the procedure after an episode of acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 2000</LINK>). Thus, approximately 13,000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies are performed annually in the UK for acute cholecystitis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-11 15:28:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>There is controversy over the timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis. In the era of open cholecystectomy, early surgery (within seven days of onset of symptoms) had no increased morbidity or mortality over delayed surgery (at least six weeks after symptoms settle) (<LINK REF="REF-Papi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papi 2004</LINK>). Delay in surgery increases the risks of further gallstone-related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrentschuk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrentschuk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papi 2004</LINK>). With laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there are concerns about higher morbidity rates in an emergency procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Cuschieri-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuschieri 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kum 1996</LINK>) and about the higher conversion rate to an open procedure during the acute phase (<LINK REF="REF-Cheema-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheema 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>). The main reason for conversion in early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is inflammation obscuring the view of Calot's triangle (<LINK REF="REF-Peng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2005</LINK>), whilst in the delayed group it is fibrotic adhesions (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2005</LINK>). Severe inflammation and fibrotic adhesions are associated with bile duct injury (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the USA, about 30% of people with acute cholecystitis undergo cholecystectomy during the acute attack (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>). In the UK, only 20% of surgeons perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="REF-Senapati-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senapati 2003</LINK>). The remaining surgeons let the symptoms settle down for a period of at least six weeks before performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy) (<LINK REF="REF-Senapati-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senapati 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used Peto's odds ratios (Peto OR) for binary outcomes when the proportion of people who developed the outcome was less than 1% (for example, bile duct injury). We also planned to report the risk difference if it was different from the RR since risk difference allows meta-analysis including trials with zero events in both groups. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for hospital stay; and we planned to calculate standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for variables such as quality of life.</P>

<P>We performed an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>) whenever possible.

We imputed the standard deviation from P values according to the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and used the median for the meta-analysis when the mean was not available. If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from the P value or the CIs, we imputed the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the other trials included under that outcome, fully recognising that this form of imputation will decrease the weight of the trial for calculation of mean differences and bias the effect estimate to no effect in the case of standardised mean difference (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>Trial sequential analysis was applied because cumulative meta-analyses are at risk of producing random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of the accumulating data (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). The underlying assumption of trial sequential analysis is that testing for significance may be performed each time a new trial is added to the meta-analysis resulting in an increased risk of random errors. We added the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year, the trials were added alphabetically according to the last name of the first author. On the basis of the required information size, trial sequential monitoring boundaries were constructed. These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size; if the trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed before the required information size is reached, firm evidence may perhaps be established and further trials may turn out to be superfluous. On the other hand, if the boundary is not surpassed, it is most probably necessary to continue doing trials in order to detect or reject a certain intervention effect (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>).   </P>

For continuous outcomes, the required sample size was calculated from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, the variance estimated from the meta-analysis results of low risk of bias trials and a minimal clinically relevant difference of one day for hospital stay and 15 minutes for operating time.</P>

<P>All the trials were at high risk of bias. The proportion of trials with low risk of bias for each of the domains is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. The risk of bias in each domain is shown for each trial in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. It should be noted that most trials have been classified as trials at high risk of bias because of the lack of blinding. However, blinding of participants involves sham operations in both groups, which may be unethical. Considering this information, the trials that have low risk of bias in domains other than blinding are likely to be trials with the lowest possible risk of bias.

There was no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 28%; P = 0.25). There was no change in the interpretation of results using the random-effects model or the risk difference. Imputing the outcomes for the one trial where there were post-randomisation drop-outs did not alter the interpretation of the findings in three of the four scenarios. In the best-worst scenario, the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury was significantly lower in the early group than the delayed group (Peto OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<P>Four trials reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD -4.12 days; 95% CI -5.22 to -3.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.67). There was no change in the interpretation of results using the random-effects model. Two trials reported the mean hospital stay and standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>) and two trials reported the median hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>). The median was used in the meta-analysis after imputing the standard deviation from the P value. The median hospital stays reported in the two trials were three days and five days lower in the early group than in the delayed group (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Operating time</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD -1.22 minutes; 95% CI -3.07 to 0.64) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 76%; P = 0.001). Adopting the random-effects model showed that the operating time was significantly longer in the early group than the delayed group (MD 15.31 minutes; 95% CI 1.09 to 29.53). Two trials reported the mean (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>), one trial reported the mean and standard deviation of the operating times in the people who underwent successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and in those who underwent conversion to open surgery separately (<LINK REF="STD-Yadav-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yadav 2009</LINK>), and three trials reported the median operating time (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>). The median was used in the meta-analysis. The median operating times reported in the two of the three trials was 21 minutes and 30 minutes longer in the early group than the delayed group (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 1999</LINK>). The median operating time in one trial in which laparoscopic common bile duct exploration was used for suspected common bile duct stones on routine peri-operative cholangiogram (with surgical residents carrying out these procedures) was two minutes shorter in the early group (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>). Excluding this trial, there was no significant heterogeneity noted (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; P = 0.76). Excluding this trial, the total operating time was significantly longer in the early group than in the delayed group (MD 20.06 minutes; 95% CI 10.21 to 29.90). Excluding the three trials which reported the median and the one trial where the mean was calculated by combining the information from two groups, the mean operating time was longer in the early group than in the delayed group (MD 15.19 minutes; 95% CI 2.63 to 27.74).</P>

One trial reported five gallstone-related morbidities (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>). Two people in the delayed group developed cholangitis during the waiting time. One patient developed biliary colic and two people developed recurrence of acute cholecystitis, which was treated conservatively. There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). The remaining trials did not report the gallstone-related morbidity during the waiting period. Forty people (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).

<P>All the trials were at high risk of bias. This was mainly due to the lack of blinding. Considering that blinding is difficult or impossible to achieve, we performed subgroup analyses of trials that had low risk of bias in other important domains (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>) compared with trials at high risk of bias. The tests for subgroup differences were not significant for any of the comparisons (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) other than operating time (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). The test for a subgroup difference was significant for operating time (P = 0.0003) but this was mainly due to the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK> in which the trainees performed the surgeries and routine cholangiogram was used.</P>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis of trials that included only people within less than four days of onset of presentation and those that also included people with more than four days from onset of presentation in the early group. There was no significant difference between the early group and delayed group in any of the outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>) other than operating time (<LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>) in spite of the difference in the time of presentation. The test for subgroup differences was significant for operating time (P = 0.007), but this again was mainly due to the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK> in which the trainees performed the surgeries and routine cholangiogram was used.</P>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis of trials in which the experience of the surgeons was either more than 50 laparoscopic cholecystectomies or the surgeons were consultants compared with trainees with less than 50 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. There was no significant difference between the early group and delayed group in any of the comparisons (<LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.13</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.14</LINK>) other than operating time (<LINK REF="CMP-002.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.15</LINK>). As mentioned previously, this was due to the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK> in which the trainees performed the surgeries and routine cholangiogram was used. However, it should be noted that even in <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>, where the operations were performed by the trainees, the trainees had a minimum experience of 25 laparoscopic cholecystectomies and the techniques had to be modified and gallbladder decompression had to be performed more often in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group, suggesting more complex surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-25 15:15:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials has found no significant difference in the proportion of patients with complications or conversion to open cholecystectomy whether laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed at presentation with acute cholecystitis or six to 12 weeks after the symptoms settle. Early surgery has the advantage of decreased hospital stay and avoids the risk of emergency surgery for non-resolved or recurrent symptoms which lead to a high rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy. Open cholecystectomy is associated with an increase in morbidity, pain, and time to return to work (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bile duct injury is the most feared complication during cholecystectomy and can be fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Sicklick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sicklick 2005</LINK>). Corrective surgery for bile duct injury has a high morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sicklick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sicklick 2005</LINK>) and the quality of life can be poor, even three years after corrective surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK>). Cholecystitis has been considered as a risk factor for bile duct injury (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nuzzo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuzzo 2005</LINK>). Observational studies have suggested a higher number of bile duct injuries with early surgery, but this was not evident from the randomised clinical trials included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soderlund-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soderlund 2005</LINK>). This difference could be due to the lack of 'intention-to-treat' analysis in observational studies, with people from the delayed surgery group planned to undergo emergency surgery being included in the early surgery group, that is, the performance of an inappropriate &#8216;treatment-received analysis&#8217;. Larger studies are required to demonstrate the small differences in bile duct injury rates between an early or delayed approach to acute cholecystitis. However, it is unlikely that large trials will be performed as the required sample size that would allow to assess differences in the bile duct is high;the five trials providing data for this meta-analysis contributed to much less than 1% of the participants' required sample size. </P>
<P>There was no significant differences in the other serious complications related to surgery between the two groups. There was also no significant difference in the proportion of people who required conversion to open surgery between the two groups. Observational studies have suggested a higher proportion of people undergoing conversion to open cholecystectomy in the early group whereas randomised trials have shown no difference between the groups. Again, this may be due to lack of 'intention-to-treat' analysis in observational studies with people from the delayed surgery group planned to undergo emergency surgery being included in the early surgery group, that is, the performance of an inappropriate &#8216;treatment-received analysis&#8217;. While there are reports of an increased proportion of conversion to open cholecystectomy when the cholecystectomy is delayed for more than 48 to 96 hours after the onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Eldar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eldar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liguori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liguori 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2005</LINK>), there are also studies that do not confirm this (<LINK REF="REF-Chandler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knight-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2004</LINK>). Two trials included only people with symptoms lasting for less than four days from onset (<LINK REF="STD-Davila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>). Three trials included people with symptoms lasting less than seven days from onset (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>). A subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in the proportion of people with conversion to open cholecystectomy or complications between people operated within four days and within seven days after the onset of symptoms, suggesting that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is possible and appropriate up to seven days from onset of symptoms.</P>
<P>The total hospital stay of the trial participants was shorter by four days with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy than with delayed surgery. This is due to the participants in the delayed group requiring two treatment episodes, one for the conservative treatment of acute cholecystitis and another for the definitive surgical treatment. In addition, a significant proportion of the participants in the delayed group (18.3%) had non-resolution or recurrent cholecystitis requiring urgent surgery or readmission due to recurrent symptoms. The trial sequential analysis revealed that the trial sequential alpha-spending boundaries were crossed suggesting that the difference in hospital stay is unlikely to be due to chance and is not a spurious finding because of repeated analysis. However, it has to be pointed out that lack of blinding can be an important source of bias in the length of hospital stay. The number of workdays lost was also less with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the only trial that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>), possibly because of two episodes of admission.</P>
<P>Another important issue is gallstone-related morbidity during the waiting period for cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy in the delayed group was performed within 12 weeks in all the trials which may explain the few gallstone-related events. However, the reality of elective cholecystectomy outside trials is likely to be different (<LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrentschuk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrentschuk 2003</LINK>). People waiting longer than 12 weeks will have a significant risk of developing complications of gallstones while waiting for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rutledge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutledge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrentschuk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrentschuk 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another main issue is the experience of the surgeons (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2003</LINK>). Although the performed subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences in the outcomes between early and delayed cholecystectomy depending upon the experience of the surgeons, the techniques had to be modified and gallbladder decompression had to be performed more often in the early group than in the delayed group, suggesting more complex surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolla-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kolla 2004</LINK>). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by upper gastrointestinal (upper GI) surgeons has lower conversion to open cholecystectomy rates and shorter hospital stay than laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by non-upper GI surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Boddy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boddy 2007</LINK>). Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should therefore be performed in units with appropriate surgical expertise.</P>
<P>A formal economic analysis revealed that a policy of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis results in an overall better quality of life for people at one year post-presentation compared with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2010</LINK>). The quality of life in the economic analysis was determined from simulation studies based on 1000 people and took into account the quality of life during the waiting period for surgery and post-operative complications. Furthermore, considering costs incurred up to one year post-presentation, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy could save approximately eight million pounds sterling annually (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2010</LINK>). The recommendation from that study, therefore, was that a policy of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be adopted in favour of delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-14 12:20:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This review is applicable to people suffering from acute cholecystitis due to gallstones who are eligible for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and it is less than seven days from onset of symptoms, with or without common bile duct stones. Two trials clearly stated that they included people fit to undergo surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1998</LINK>). It is likely that the other trials included only such people. So, this review is only applicable for people fit to undergo laparoscopic surgery.</P>
<P>There is a high risk of type I (erroneously concluding that an intervention is beneficial when it is actually not beneficial) and type II errors (erroneously concluding that an intervention is not beneficial when it is actually beneficial) because of the few trials included, the small sample size in each trial, and the small number of outcomes such as bile duct injury, other serious complications, and conversion to open surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). New trials with adequate sample sizes will decrease the risk of type I and type II errors, but it is unlikely that individual trials will be powered to measure the differences in bile duct injury or serious complications in the foreseeable future.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-11 15:41:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The overall quality of evidence was moderate for hospital stay and operating time, and was very low for the other outcomes, as shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. All the trials that contributed to the meta-analyses in this review were at high risk of bias. However, blinding is impossible to achieve for participants and care providers in this comparison (early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis), so it is unlikely that trials with low risk of bias can be designed. Future trials ought to blind outcome assessors.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-25 14:57:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We have performed a thorough search of the literature and two people independently selected the trials and performed the data extraction. We have performed the review according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We imputed the standard deviation and mean from P values and medians when they were not available for continuous outcomes. Excluding such trials in which these measures were imputed did not alter the conclusions of this review. Thus the potential bias due to the imputation of these values appears minimal. Overall, we are limited by the quality of the evidence available rather than the methods used in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-13 12:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-25 15:08:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of bias are necessary to decrease the risk of bias as well as type I and type II errors. However, the majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that individual randomised clinical trials will be sufficiently powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this involves performing a trial of more than 50,000 people. Therefore, we likely will get answers to the many questions through several smaller randomised clinical trials assessed through systematic reviews with meta-analyses. Future trials need to be designed according to the SPIRIT Statement (<LINK REF="REF-SPIRIT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPIRIT 2013</LINK>) and need to be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT Statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of bile duct injury</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 77,854 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 0.9%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 438 participants in the five trials, we have only reached 0.56% of the DARIS. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed. Less than 1% of the required sample size was reached in the trials included in the meta-analysis. This was too little to draw the trial sequential monitoring boundaries.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of other serious complications</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 13,493 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 5.0%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 438 participants in the five trials, we have only reached 3.25% of the DARIS. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of conversion to open cholecystectomy</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 2225 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 24.7%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 488 participants in the six trials, only 21.9% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the inner wedge futility area. As shown, none of the boundaries have been crossed, ie, neither the trial sequential monitoring boundaries nor the conventional boundaries.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of hospital stay </B>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis of operating time showing that the accumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary after the third trial. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 1649 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of one day, a variance (VAR) of 52.5, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. The results are compatible with significant reduction of hospital stay favouring the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group without risk of random errors.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of operating time</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 1107 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 130.52, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 98.28%. After accruing 488 participants in the six trials, only 44.08% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the inner wedge futility area was not drawn. The trial sequential analysis shows that the trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefits and harms were not crossed, but the conventional boundary for harm was initially crossed.</P>
