<P>There is not enough evidence to determine whether active chest physiotherapy is of benefit to neonates on mechanical ventilation. Babies who require mechanical ventilation are at risk of lung collapse from increased secretions. Chest physiotherapy (patting or vibrating the chest) is used to improve clearance of secretions from the airway to try to prevent lung collapse. This review found no clear overall benefit or harm from chest physiotherapy. Some individual chest physiotherapy techniques were more beneficial than others in resolving atelectasis and maintaining oxygenation. These results do not support one technique over another. Due to the limited number, poor quality and age of trials in this review, there is not enough evidence to determine whether or not chest physiotherapy is beneficial or harmful in the treatment of infants being ventilated in today's intensive care units. Further good quality trials are needed to address this issue.</P>

<P>Three trials involving 106 infants were included in this review. In one trial (n = 20) CPT was no better than standard care in clearing secretions. No increase in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage was noted. Two trials compared different types of active CPT. One trial (n = 56) showed that non-resolved atelectasis was reduced in more neonates receiving the lung squeezing technique (LST) when compared to postural drainage, percussion and vibration (PDPV) (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57). No difference in secretion clearance or in the rate of intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leucomalacia was demonstrated. The other trial (n = 30) showed that the use of percussion or 'cupping' resulted in an increased incidence of hypoxaemia (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.99) and increased oxygen requirements (MD -9.68; 95% CI -14.16 to -5.20) when compared with contact heel percussion. There was insufficient information to adequately assess important short and longer-term outcomes, including adverse effects.<BR/>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-10 10:28:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-10 10:28:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately two to three per cent of all babies born in Australia and New Zealand require admission to a level three neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (<LINK REF="REF-ANZNN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZNN 2005</LINK>). In this group of high-risk infants, 89% require assisted ventilation. Chest physiotherapy (CPT) techniques are used in many NICUs throughout the world to improve airway clearance and treat lung collapse in infants on ventilatory support.</P>
<P>The application of CPT in airway management of mechanically ventilated adults has been shown to improve total lung/thoracic compliance and cardiorespiratory function (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 1985</LINK>); however, little is known about its effect on neonates. Acute lobar atelectasis is a common problem in infants receiving mechanical ventilation. Atelectasis contributes to morbidity in the neonatal nursery, necessitating prolongation of oxygen administration (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrlich-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrlich 1972</LINK>). Although CPT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both non-ventilated children (<LINK REF="REF-Zach-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 1987</LINK>) and intubated adults (<LINK REF="REF-Stiller-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiller 1990</LINK>) with acute lobar collapse, studies of the effectiveness in the neonatal population are conflicting. In the neonatal population, CPT is used to prevent and treat lung collapse and consolidation. Some studies in the neonatal population have shown positive effects of CPT, including improved oxygenation (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 1979</LINK>) and increased removal of secretions (<LINK REF="STD-Etches-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Etches 1978</LINK>). However, the use of CPT has also received much criticism, largely as a result of reports of adverse outcomes. Documented adverse outcomes include hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Fox-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1978</LINK>), bruising, rib fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Purohit-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purohit 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dabezies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dabezies 1997</LINK>) and intracranial lesions such as intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>) and porencephalic cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Cross-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>CPT in the preterm infant consists of a variety of techniques that include positioning, active techniques such as percussion and vibration, and suction. Percussion involves a rhythmical cupping action applied to the chest wall performed with a full cupped hand, tented fingers, or by using an infant resuscitation face mask (cupping). The technique of vibration can be performed manually by using the fingers to cause a fine shaking motion of the chest wall. Alternatively, an electric toothbrush or other vibrating device can be used.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The use of these techniques, in varying combinations and frequencies, has become standard treatment for a variety of pulmonary conditions. Since there are many combinations of treatments that constitute CPT, it is difficult to determine the exact effects of any particular treatment technique. There has been some attempt in the past to ascertain which techniques produced the most clinically relevant results, but the results are equivocal. One study found percussion to be better than vibration (<LINK REF="STD-Tudehope-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Tudehope 1980</LINK>), while another has found the opposite to be the case (<LINK REF="STD-Curran-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 1979</LINK>). A third study found that there was no difference between the techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Hartrick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartrick 1982</LINK>). In clinical practice, percussion and vibration are rarely used in isolation; most often percussion and vibration are given in combination with positioning, postural drainage and airway suction. Therefore, it is difficult to assess separately the efficacy of each treatment component.</P>
<P>Previous Cochrane reviews have investigated the positioning (<LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2006</LINK>) and suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Pritchard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritchard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodgate-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodgate 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spence-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 2003</LINK>) components of CPT. Only one review has assessed the effect of active CPT on preterm infants, and this study involved a population of infants who were being extubated (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2002</LINK>). This review could not recommend guidelines for clinical practice due to small numbers of infants studied and the insufficient information on outcomes other than the reduction in post-extubation atelectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2002</LINK>). In light of the results of this review and the amount of conflicting information from other studies, it is important to investigate the wider use of the techniques of percussion and vibration in the preterm population.<BR/>
<BR/>Since the issue of the effectiveness of physiotherapy is still a controversial topic, it is anticipated that this review will provide evidence on which to base guidelines regarding the provision of the chest physiotherapy techniques of percussion and vibration in the infant on ventilatory support.<B>

<P>We used the standard search strategy for the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (see: Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, search strategy for Specialised Register in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>). The review authors undertook a comprehensive search which included searches of the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2007), EMBASE (1988 to June 2007), CINAHL (1982 to June 2007), PEDro (1929 to June 2007) and Web of Science. The review authors cross-referenced relevant literature including identified trials and review articles.</P>
<P>Searches of the electronic databases were based on the following search strategy:<BR/>1. physiotherapy OR physical therapy, AND<BR/>2. infant OR neonate OR newborn, AND<BR/>3. chest OR lung OR respiratory<BR/>4. NOT cystic fibrosis</P>
<P>The search also included searches of previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching restricted to the English language.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-10 10:27:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of the Neonatal Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration.Two review authors searched for and considered trials for inclusion, evaluated methodological quality and extracted data independently. Differences in interpretation were resolved by discussion with a third review author.<BR/>Where necessary, we contacted investigators of identified trials for additional information regarding trial methodology or outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Crane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Crane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etches-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Etches 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tudehope-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Tudehope 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartrick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartrick 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fiser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Main-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Main 2001</LINK>). Since many of these studies were performed quite a few years ago some of the authors either no longer had the data available (<LINK REF="STD-Etches-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Etches 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tudehope-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Tudehope 1980</LINK>) or could not be contacted (<LINK REF="STD-Crane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Crane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartrick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartrick 1982</LINK>). At the time of this review, additional data had been received from <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>, and was included in this review.
<BR/>

<BR/>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>We conducted quality assessment according to the methods described in section six of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2007</LINK>). We considered four major sources of potential bias and methods of avoidance when assessing the trial quality:</P>
<P>(1) selection bias - blinding of randomisation;<BR/>(2) performance bias - blinding of intervention;<BR/>(3) attrition bias - complete follow-up;<BR/>(4) detection bias - blinding of outcome assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>A quality rating was assigned to each trial for the criterion of blinding of randomisation as follows: (A) adequate, (B) unclear, (C) inadequate, or (D) not used. A quality rating of (A) yes, (B) can't tell, or (C) no, was assigned to the other quality components (completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome assessment). High quality trials were defined as those receiving an A rating for blinding of randomisation (central computerised randomisation service or sealed opaque envelopes). The quality assessment rating included in the Table of 'Characteristics of Included Studies' refers to blinding of randomisation (allocation concealment) only.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Two review authors independently extracted data using prepared data extraction forms. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion with a third review author.<BR/>
<BR/>We used the Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2.7) (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) for statistical analyses. In the cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>) investigators provided individual patient data for each intervention on oxygenation. From this data the authors derived the group means and standard deviations for per cent change in oxygenation. The numbers of infants who experienced one or more hypoxaemic episode during each intervention were included for the outcome of hypoxaemia.<BR/>
<BR/>Due to insufficient data it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. For individual trials, where possible, mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for data measured on a continuous scale. For categorical outcomes, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals are reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods for future updates of this review</B>
<BR/>We did not implement all of the methods outlined in the protocol as there were insufficient data.<BR/>For future updates of the review, we will analyse categorical data using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) where appropriate. We will use a fixed-effect model to pool results. We will use weighted mean differences (WMD) for data measured on a continuous scale. We will report the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimates. We will perform sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of the trial quality (excluding quasi-randomised trials and considering trials with minimal bias). We will assess heterogeneity by visual inspection of the outcomes tables and by using an I-squared test of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). Where statistical heterogeneity is found, the review authors will look for an explanation using prespecified subgroup analyses.</P>

<P>The search strategy initially retrieved 2036 references of which 1993 publications were excluded based upon title and abstract. We identified the remaining 43 publications as potentially eligible for inclusion in this review and requiring more detailed examination. After examination of the publications, we excluded 40 publications from the review. Thirty-one publications were excluded as they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Of these 31, we excluded 23 trials as they were not randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, six trials because the participants were not newborn infants with respiratory disease in the first four weeks of life, one because the participants were not mechanically ventilated, and a further one trial because the intervention was not a physiotherapy technique. We excluded a further four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Crane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Crane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartrick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartrick 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fiser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>) as the publications were in the form of conference abstracts and despite attempts to do so no further data could be obtained from the authors.<BR/>We excluded another five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Etches-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Etches 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curran-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Curran 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tudehope-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Tudehope 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Main-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Main 2001</LINK>) as no useable data were reported or could be obtained from the authors.</P>
<P>(For further details on excluded studies see the table of 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies').</P>
<P>One ongoing trial was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Hough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hough 2007</LINK>) (See table of 'Characteristics of Ongoing Studies').</P>
<P>Three trials were included in the review.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK> compared the effects of CPT in 20 premature neonates with a gestational age of 28 to 32 weeks. Infants who were intubated and ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention in the CPT group (n = 10) consisted of postural drainage in the head up and head down position, percussion, vibration and suction. The control group (n = 10) procedure consisted of suctioning only. Each of these procedures was performed every two to three hours in the first 24 hours of life. Outcomes measured used were continuous TcPO2 monitoring, arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling, weight of sputum cleared, mortality rate and rates of intracranial lesions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK> evaluated the responses of critically ill neonates to two different techniques of CPT administration. Thirty neonates (25 to 42 weeks gestational age) who were 28 days old or younger were randomised in a two-period cross-over design to one of two groups. Group 1 received postural drainage, endotracheal instillation of saline, suction and percussion consisting of cupping with a Bennett face mask (Bennett percussion) followed by Boyd percussion (contact heel percussion) an hour later. Group 2 received the same interventions in the reverse order. The neonates' responses for heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), TcPO2 and TcPCO2 were recorded during the pre-CPT, postural drainage, percussion, ETT instillation and suctioning, and immediately post-CPT phases.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> enrolled 56 neonates who were aged less than 37 weeks gestation and required mechanical ventilation if they met the inclusion criteria of the presence of a segmental or lobar collapse confirmed on chest x-ray. Lung squeezing technique (LST), a form of manual chest wall compression, was compared in a group of 26 neonates with conventional treatment of postural drainage, percussion and vibration (PDPV). Therapy sessions were performed twice daily at specified times until resolution of atelectasis occurred. Re-expansion of atelectasis, recurrence of atelectasis, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen dependency, occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), rates of intracranial lesions and mortality rate were the outcomes measured in this study.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Types of participants</B>
<BR/>A total of 106 infants were randomised in the three included trials investigating CPT in neonates.<BR/>Participant recruitment and inclusion criteria varied between the three trials; <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK> included preterm infants with a birth weight less than 2000 grams, <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> recruited mechanically ventilated infants with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks, and <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK> included any newborn infant requiring intubation. Gestational ages varied from between 28 to 32 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>), 22 to 36 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>) and 25 to 42 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>). Birth weights varied correspondingly with one study not stating birth weight (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>), the second ranging from 540 to 2900 grams (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>), and in third the study (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>) the infants tending to be heavier (ranging in weight from 750 to 4030 grams). Postnatal age at the time of the study varied from 1 to 12 hours of age (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>) to 1 to 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>). In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>, the postnatal age was not stated. The primary diagnosis for enrolled infants in <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK> was RDS, whereas for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> the main diagnosis was atelectasis. In the third study, the diagnoses included hyaline membrane disease (HMD), pneumonia and transient tachypnoea of the newborn (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>). All three studies included only infants who were mechanically ventilated. Only two of the studies stated exclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK> included infants requiring sedation for irritability and/or restlessness, while <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> stated their exclusion criteria as persistent pulmonary hypertension, meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital heart defects, pneumonia presenting with generalised patchy consolidation, post-cardiothoracic surgery, pleural effusion and pneumothorax.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of interventions</B>
<BR/>The types of interventions assessed differed across the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK> compared CPT comprising postural drainage in the head up and in the head down positions, percussion, vibration and suctioning (PDPV) with a control group receiving standard care. Each of these procedures was performed every two to three hours throughout the first 24 hours of life. <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> also used the PDPV technique combination but compared this with another CPT technique called the lung squeezing technique (LST) until resolution of atelectasis. The remaining study compared individual techniques of percussion with a face mask (cupping) and contact heel percussion using a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>). Each infant received each technique once in a randomised order over approximately a three hour period.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcome measures</B>
<BR/>Short-term physiological outcomes of oxygenation could be included from one cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>). In this trial, transcutaneous oxygenation, changes in oxygen requirements and hypoxic episodes were measured 10 minutes pre and post-intervention. Although <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK> measured PaCO2, we could not include this data in the analyses as the standard deviation data could not be obtained from the author. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>, oxygenation was reported in figure format and as the authors could not be contacted, we could not include the data on oxygenation in the review. Secretion clearance was also used as an outcome measure in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> defined the secretions as obvious if the amount collected during a single intervention was greater than 0.2 ml. <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK> measured the amounts of secretions collected over a 24-hour period and reported average secretion per procedure. Rates of intracranial lesions diagnosed by ultrasound scan and mortality rate were measured in the two parallel group studies. Ultrasound scans were done at three to five days of postnatal life in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>) and for three consecutive days after the first intervention in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). For the purposes of this review the highest grade of haemorrhage was included. Although the study by <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK> did not include ultrasound findings, they did report changes in intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure; however, these measurements were not included in our pre-specified outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK> was the only study to document duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen dependency and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and the presence of atelectasis on chest radiographs.</P>

<P>
<B>Concealment of allocation</B>
<BR/>Of the three included studies, only one reported an adequate method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). This study used a computerised random number allocation placed in sealed opaque envelopes, and stratified by mode of ventilation [high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV)]. The other two reported randomly assigning participants to groups but did not report on the method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-10 10:24:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes the results of three trials that studied 106 infants. Due to insufficient data and differences in reporting of outcome measures meta-analysis could not be undertaken.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>The pre-specified primary outcomes of duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen after intervention, and duration of hospital stay were not reported in any of the three trials included in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>Data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK>) comparing active CPT (postural drainage, percussion and vibration (PDPV)) with standard care did not show any difference in the outcome of weight of secretions cleared.<BR/>
<BR/>The remaining two studies compared different types of active CPT techniques. In one trial, the lung squeezing technique (LST) resulted in a decrease in the number of infants with non-resolution of atelectasis after the first treatment; however, LST did not result in a corresponding improvement in secretion clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). This study also reported that LST took significantly fewer therapy sessions to attain full re-expansion of the atelectatic lung than the PDPV group (p &lt; 0.001). Despite LST being superior to PDPV in attaining lung re-expansion, the rate of recurrence of lung atelectasis was similar in both groups (p = 0.8) and there was no difference in the number of infants whose lungs failed to re-expand (p = 0.7). In the analyses on change in oxygenation, cupping resulted in more hypoxaemia and increased oxygen requirements compared with contact heel percussion.</P>
<P>The results of this review indicate that although there was no clear benefit for the use of CPT over standard care, LST was superior to PDPV for the treatment of atelectasis, and neonates were kept better oxygenated with contact heel percussion compared to cupping. LST, although reportedly used in Asia, does not appear to be used extensively throughout other parts of the world. Further research is required to better understand the indications for and outcomes of this technique.</P>
<P>CPT has come under much criticism due to adverse events such as intracranial lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Harding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1998</LINK>) and rib fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Purohit-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purohit 1975</LINK>). This review found that there was no difference in the risk of developing intracranial lesions, either between active CPT and standard care or between types of techniques. However, the analysis between active CPT and standard care did approach significance and therefore raises some concern as to whether this finding is clinically significant. Practices described in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1987</LINK> comparing active CPT and standard care are very different to those currently used in most neonatal nurseries. Although there was no evidence of adverse events or harm, the small numbers of infants included in the review meant that important outcomes could not be assessed. Due to insufficient data, planned subgroup analyses of infants &lt; 30 weeks gestation who are potentially more at risk could not be undertaken.<BR/>

<BR/>
The findings of this review highlight the limitations of the evidence presently available from randomised trials.<BR/>These limitations include:<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality of included studies</B>
</P>
<P>Only one trial was considered to be of relatively high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2003</LINK>). As only one trial reported blinded allocation to treatment, no trials blinded the intervention, and it is unknown whether there was blinded assessment of outcome, the potential for a high risk of bias in these studies cannot be excluded. Blinding of intervention is important when blinding of outcome is not undertaken. This is an inherent problem in trials investigating CPT (<LINK REF="REF-Wallis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallis 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Small numbers</B>
</P>
<P>Due to the small numbers of infants enrolled in the included trials, all estimates of effect are imprecise resulting in the inability to assess adequately the effects of this intervention. Subgroup analyses of high risk infants (&lt; 30 weeks) could not be undertaken. This is an important deficiency in the evidence currently available.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Inconsistency in study design</B>
</P>
<P>The included trials employed different interventions and outcome measures and, therefore, could not be combined. Even when oxygenation was the outcome measured, the three studies defined it in slightly different ways, precluding the ability to combine the results. Other factors which may have had an impact on the results obtained could be differences in inclusion criteria and technique delivery.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Applicability to present day practice</B>
</P>
<P>Two of these studies were conducted over 20 years ago. Applicability of the results to present day practice may be compromised due to changes in population characteristics and interventions including: exogenous surfactant, changes in modes of ventilation, and changes in how CPT is delivered. Importantly, two of the trials included a head down tip for postural drainage, which is not used today as it has been shown to increase the risk of IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cowan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowan 1985</LINK>). Since continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being used more frequently, the effect of CPT in infants on CPAP should also be included in future reviews.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Absence of primary outcome measures in included studies</B>
</P>
<P>Clinically relevant long-term outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, and duration of hospital stay have not been reported in any of the included trials.</P>
<P>These limitations all highlight the need for further good quality randomised trials. Due to insufficient data there is not enough reliable evidence to support or refute the use of CPT<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-10 10:02:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence to guide clinical practice on the use of CPT techniques in infants on ventilatory support in today's neonatal intensive care settings. Although concern for the safety of active CPT in preterm infants has been reported, possible adverse effects of CPT could not be evaluated due to insufficient data. In view of this and the lack of clear evidence for benefit, it would seem wise to use this intervention cautiously.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-03-14 12:15:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well-designed trials are required to assess the risks and benefits of CPT in the treatment of respiratory diseases in ventilated neonates. Future trials should be adequately powered to address clinically important outcomes, particularly for the high risk population of infants &lt; 30 weeks gestation. Clinically important outcomes which should be assessed include duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay, and presence of intracranial lesions. Shorter-term outcomes such as resolution of atelectasis, oxygenation, and other lung function variables such as ventilation distribution should also be included. Costs also need to be considered.<BR/>
<BR/>Some of the important clinical and economic outcomes that remain unmeasured by current research are likely to require a very large sample size, therefore, a large multicentre trial would be recommended.</P>
