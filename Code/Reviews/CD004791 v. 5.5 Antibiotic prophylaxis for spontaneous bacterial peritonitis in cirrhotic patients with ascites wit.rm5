<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-04 16:10:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (infection and inflammation of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity) is a frequent complication among cirrhotic patients (patients with end-stage liver disease marked by irreversible scarring of liver tissue) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Selective intestinal decontamination, employing antibiotics, is a proposed prophylactic (preventive) measure. This systematic review of randomised clinical trials assesses whether antibiotic prophylaxis prevents spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality among cirrhotic patients with ascites (excess fluid in the abdominal cavity) and no gastrointestinal bleeding. Nine trials are included in the review. The pooled rates of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality indicate that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces both. There are very few reports of adverse events. Reviewing these trials, we found poor methodology, evidence suggesting publication bias, and limited follow-up periods. Thus, the recommendation to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics to cirrhotic patients without gastrointestinal bleeding is hampered by quality of the trials that generated the data. Due to potential hazards, both to society as a whole and the patients, as individuals, before antibiotic prophylaxis can be confidently recommended, trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are required.</P>

<P>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is frequent among cirrhotic patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Selective intestinal decontamination employing antibiotics is a proposed prophylactic measure.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-04 15:37:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We searched for randomised clinical trials assessing prophylactic treatment among adult cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding, comparing antibiotic therapy with no intervention, placebo, or with another antibiotic regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-09 10:23:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Three independent authors searched for and collected the trials and extracted relevant data. Four other independent authors validated the findings and assessed them. The studies were assessed for design, patient and intervention characteristics, and quality. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate measures of association between antibiotic prophylaxis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or mortality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-23 11:07:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Nine trials were included in the review. Seven trials, comparing antibiotics to placebo or no treatment, were meta-analysed. Systematic bias in design or publication is suggested by trial results. The randomisation results suggest that the probability that true randomisation took place in all trials is very small and the report of most trials regarding design was poor. The proportion of participants with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis varied between the trials from 15% to 50%. The calculated relative risks (95% confidence interval) of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality among patients treated with antibiotics compared with no treatment/placebo were 0.20 (0.11 to 0.37) and 0.61 (0.43 to 0.87). There were very few reports of adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-12 19:36:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pooled estimates suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might be prudent among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding. However, poor trial methodology and report coupled with findings suggesting systematic bias in publication and design reflect the fragility of these findings. Potential hazard to society and the patients themselves from resistant pathogens should be considered when promoting long-lasting antibiotic prophylaxis. It seems that recommending antibiotic prophylaxis is still far from being a substantiated prevention strategy. Trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are greatly needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-23 11:07:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhosis. The incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalised patients with cirrhosis ranges from 7% to 25%, with an in-hospital mortality rate ranging from 20% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Runyon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runyon 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tito-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tito 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toledo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toledo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Follo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follo 1994</LINK>). Prospective studies have shown that one-year mortality rates, following an event of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, range from 65% to 93% (<LINK REF="REF-Tito-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tito 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andreu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreu 1993</LINK>). Recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is common, reported to be between 30% and 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Tito-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tito 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>). The accepted pathologic mechanism for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the passage of intestinal bacteria into ascitic fluid and into the general circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Runyon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runyon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 1995</LINK>). The clinical syndrome associated with infection of ascites is thought to result from the response of the innate immune system as an inflammatory mechanism, the poor opsonic capacity of the immune cells in the ascitic fluid, impaired systemic response to invasion due to reduced reticuloendothelial phagocytic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Andreu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreu 1993</LINK>) and pathogen toxicity and invasiveness. Several risk factors for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis have been identified, including low protein concentration in ascitic fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Runyon-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runyon 1986</LINK>), variceal haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1995</LINK>), and prior episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Tito-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tito 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andreu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreu 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Selective intestinal decontamination by elimination of gram-negative bacilli from the intestinal flora in cirrhotic patients with gastro-intestinal bleeding is widely accepted on the basis of two meta-analyses that showed a reduction in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis for patients given prophylactic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2003</LINK>). However, primary antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with ascites, not suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding, is controversial. Unfortunately, most studies of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients have examined heterogeneous populations with both primary and secondary prophylaxis being assessed within the same study (<LINK REF="REF-Mowat-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowat 2001</LINK>). Several such studies have shown that the use of antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the incidence of gram-negative infections and of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but an improved survival has not been shown in any of them (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>). Secondary prophylaxis with oral antibiotics for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is recommended by the International Ascites Club on the basis of one randomised placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>).<BR/>

<LI>Unclear, authors either provide no rational for their calculation or report their calculation in retrospect - suggesting a post-hoc assessment and no preplanned sample size calculation.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, no calculation reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials with adequate generation of the allocation sequence, adequate allocation concealment, adequate blinding, adequate follow-up, adequate intention-to-treat analysis, and adequate sample-size calculation were considered low-bias risk trials (high methodological quality). Trials with one or more unclear or inadequate quality components were classified as high-bias risk trials (low methodological quality) (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>We originally planned to use the classification of quality for sensitivity analyses and not as exclusion criteria. We solved disagreements through discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Dichotomous data were analysed by calculating the relative risk (RR) for each trial with uncertainty in each result being expressed using 95% confidence intervals (CI). We examined all outcomes with both a fixed-effect and a random-effects model meta-analysis. We report only the results of the fixed- effect meta-analysis unless the two analyses differ regarding the outcome (ie, one of them significant (P &lt; 0.05) and the other not).</P>
<P>
<B>Heterogeneity assessment</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was assessed by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating a test of heterogeneity (Chi-square). We anticipated between-trial variation in estimation of morbidity and mortality for participants who presented with advanced liver disease, and among those with low ascitic fluid protein concentration and different risks for the occurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Therefore, we originally planned to perform subgroup analyses assessing the impact of these possible sources of heterogeneity on the main results. Additional subgroup analyses were planned regarding adequacy of the methodological components and previous antibiotic therapy for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or prevention of ascites bacterial infection. These subgroup analyses were not performed due to paucity of data available for these analyses. Analyses were performed separately for trials comparing antibiotic to placebo/no treatment as opposed to those trials which compared competing antibiotics.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of randomisation<BR/>
</B>We assessed the probability of true randomisation by calculating the probability of at least k statistically significant differences among n between patient treatment group comparisons of background data in each trial (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We assumed that the maximal probability of a significant difference is 0.05. This calculation was performed using standard probability calculation with a binomial distribution assumption. We then examined goodness of fit by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in order to assess whether the probability that the set of the calculated binomial probabilities were randomly dispersed in an even flat distribution or whether they departed from flatness (suggesting a low probability of true randomisation) (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Publication bias</B>
<BR/>A funnel plot estimating the precision of trials (plot of logarithm of the RR for efficacy against the sample size) was used in order to estimate potential asymmetry. The standard normal deviate (SND), defined as the RR divided by its standard error, was regressed against the estimate's precision (regression equation: SND = a + b * precision) in order to facilitate the prediction of potential heterogeneity or data irregularities in the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Another method that we used was the fail-safe N (<LINK REF="REF-Orwin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orwin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iyengar-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iyengar 1988</LINK>). This method uses the required number of trials resulting in a no effect result (RR = 1) in order reach the overall pooled result. Thus, it assesses potential publication bias. This allowed us to evaluate the possibility whether there are indeed missing trials sufficient to overturn any results form the available trials (<LINK REF="REF-Persaud-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persaud 1996</LINK>).</P>

<B>Literature search<BR/>
</B>Four hundred and seven potentially relevant references were initially identified through electronic databases and screened for retrieval. Three hundred sixty-three references were excluded because they were irrelevant (studies of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis treatment, other interventions, liver transplantations, animal studies, epidemiological reports, reviews of the literature, etc); Twenty-six studies were excluded because they related to antibiotics prophylaxis in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Three studies were excluded because they were retrospective (<LINK REF="REF-Tomas-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llovet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campillo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campillo 1998</LINK>), four examined the effect of antibiotic treatment on stool flora alone (<LINK REF="REF-Soriano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soriano 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thadepalli-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadepalli 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soriano-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soriano 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borzio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borzio 1997</LINK>), and two were meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2003</LINK>). Nine articles were retrieved for more detailed evaluation; one was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Sandhu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhu 2005</LINK>) because it examined the effectiveness of the addition of cisapride to norfloxacin. Another was excluded because it included a significant proportion of patients with concurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Novella-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Novella 1997</LINK>). The reference lists of the included trials, meta-analyses, and some review articles were searched, but no additional trials were identified through bibliographic references. The initial search gave seven trials, included in this review. While preparing the review, two additional trials were published and thus also included (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria<BR/>
</B>We found that all trials, reviewed in this report, had included patients suffering from cirrhosis, as diagnosed by either pathologic and/or clinical criteria. The diagnosis criteria were not specifically presented in any of the trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Two trials excluded patients, and one did not include patients, who had previously suffered, at any time, from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and thus were primary prevention trials (<LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>) included only ascitic patients who recovered from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis on the index hospitalisation when recruiting took place, and thus assessed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis secondary prophylaxis. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>) included both patients who had not experienced spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and patients who had. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Original patient population</B>
<BR/>Hospitalized patients were the population of origin from which patients were included in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>). Four trials did not specify the characteristics of their source population (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>). Of note, prior to randomisation <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> specified that the patients included in their trial had been treated with cefotaxime after diagnosis of an index case of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Stratified randomisation and randomisation success<BR/>
</B>Stratification of patients into randomisation groups was performed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>) in which patients were stratified according to the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This was assessed by allocating patients to the high risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis group, if they had least one of the following: low protein ascites (below 1 gram per decilitre), high serum bilirubin levels (above 3 gram per decilitre), and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine more than 72 mg/dl).<BR/>
<BR/>In three trials, the patient characteristics are presented and there appear to be no statistically significant differences between the trial groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>, the proportion of patients treated with diuretics was significantly higher in the ciprofloxacin group (86% versus 54%), and the placebo group had higher bilirubin levels (42 versus 48 &#956;mol/l); 2 of 15 comparisons (13%, 95% CI 1.6% to 40%) were statistically significant. In <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>, there was one significant difference out of 15 comparisons (7%, 95% CI 0.17% to 31%), the treatment group had a higher proportion of patients with previous hepatic encephalopathy (60% versus 33%). <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK> presented data in which the placebo group has significantly lower bilirubin levels (88 versus 66 &#956;mol/l) and significantly higher ascitic protein levels (9.3 versus 10.4 g/l); 2 out of 9 comparisons were significantly different (22%, 95% CI 2.8% to 60%). In <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>, the group treated with rufloxacin had a significantly higher Child-Pugh score (10.9 versus 10.4); thus, 1 out of 14 comparisons (7%, 95%CI 0.1% to 33%) was considered statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK> presented data in which the patient group with no treatment had higher serum creatinine levels (1.76 versus 1.00 mg/dl), higher serum urea levels (59 versus 33 mg/dl), and lower total protein in the ascitic fluid (9.6 versus 13.7 g/l). These three comparisons were significantly different among the presented 15 comparisons (20%, 95% CI 5% to 40%). In <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>, there was one statistically significant difference between the treatment groups among 22 comparisons (4.5%, 95% CI 0.1% to 22%); the norfloxacin group had an initially higher mean white blood cell count (6880 versus 6020 WBC per mm<SUP>3</SUP>).</P>
<P>When examining the distribution of binomial probabilities of such results under true randomisation, the distribution of the probabilities of the randomisation results in the reviewed trials departed from the probability that these randomisation results were a natural random occurrence (P value &lt; 0.001).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment and comparison</B>
<BR/>Two trials assessed prophylactic antibiotic treatment compared with no treatment at all (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>). Five trials used placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>). Two head-to-head trials compared different prophylactic treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Oral norfloxacin, 400 mg per day, was a treatment arm in six trials. In one trial it was compared with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>). In three trials it was compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>). One trial compared it with oral rufloxacin, 400 mg once a week (<LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK> compared it with the combination of oral trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (160mg/800mg) five days per week.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK> compared oral ciprofloxacin, 750 mg weekly, with placebo, and <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK> compared oral ciprofloxacin, 500 mg daily, with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK> compared trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, 160 mg/800 mg five days per week, with no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Follow-up</B>
<BR/>One trial did not report mean follow-up time but only the median (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>). Another limited follow-up to the duration of patient stay in hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK> began follow-up with monthly patient visits for three months and then continued follow-up bimonthly or tri-monthly, respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK> followed patients for six months. <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK> followed patients on a monthly basis for six months and then continued bimonthly. <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK> followed patients bimonthly for a year. <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK> followed patients on a monthly basis for a year.</P>
<P>
<B>Sample size<BR/>
</B>Six trials performed sample size calculations. In <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>, the sample size was calculated employing a non-inferiority method expecting the spontaneous bacterial peritonitis rate among the patients receiving norfloxacin to be 20% per-year and the maximal difference in the rufloxacin group, retaining the null hypothesis, being 15% (ie, a rate between 5% and 35%). <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> estimated that among the group receiving placebo, the annual spontaneous bacterial peritonitis rate would be 70% and thus calculated a sample size in order to detect a two-fold decrease of the spontaneous bacterial peritonitis rate to 35% per year. <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK> calculated their sample size expecting a 25% decrease in the rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among treated patients. <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK> estimated a 30% risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in six months and a 50% reduction in the treated group. All four trials had managed to recruit the required participant numbers. <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK> calculated their sample size assuming that the expected one-year survival of patients in the placebo group would be 25% and 55% in the treatment group. However, this calculation seems not to have been a priori but rather post factum. <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK> calculated their required sample size assuming that the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the treatment group would be 2% and 20% in the placebo group.</P>
<P>
<B>Censorship and assessment of compliance</B>
<BR/>Censorship criteria were specified in only one trial and included liver transplantation, death, loss to follow-up, and the occurrence of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK> defined censorship when spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred, when liver transplantation took place, or on death.<BR/>
<BR/>Non-compliance was considered in patients who failed to take more than 25% of their pills of missed two or more visits (<LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>) or who had not taken their medication during five or more consecutive days (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>), or not taken 10% or more of the pills, or in whom the antibiotic was not detected in two or more urine samples (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>), and patients who did not take their medication during two or more consecutive weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>). In the four trials the authors did not specify whether non-compliant patients were censored from follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK> defined none-compliance when a patient did not take his medication for seven days or more and assessed compliance on a bimonthly visit. Four trials did not define or did not address censorship and compliance issues (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis diagnosis</B>
<BR/>In all trials, the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis required increased levels of polymorphonuclear cells in aspirated ascitic fluid. <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> required these levels be above 350 polymorphonuclear cells per millilitre, while the other eight trials required the level be above 250 polymorphonuclear cells per millilitre. <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK> did not specify whether clinical symptoms and signs were a prerequisite for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Positive ascitic fluid cultures were required for the diagnosis in three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>, however, negative cultures did not prevent diagnosis if either there was an ascitic polymorphonuclear concentration above 500 cells per millilitre or there were visible bacteria in microscopic evaluation of the fluid. All trials stated that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was only diagnosed if no other source of infection could explain these findings.<BR/>
<BR/>

<P>We performed a meta-analysis including the data from seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>). The trials compared antibiotic treatment with either placebo or no treatment. We also performed analyses on the four trials assessing norfloxacin (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>). We describe the results from <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>, assessing one antibiotic versus another antibiotic, separately. Four patients who were experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding were included in <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; however, they were a minority among 63 patients in the trial. Similarly, 3 patients out of 68 in the <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK> trials had experienced gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</B>
<BR/>The pooled relative risk (RR) was calculated to be 0.20 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Of 270 control patients, 58 (21%, 95% CI 16% to 27%) had experienced at least one event of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Thus, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), using the point estimates, is 0.168, and the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) is 5.9 patients in order to prevent an event of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Recalculating these measures with the less favouring extremes of the confidence intervals, RR = 0.37 and risk of 16%, yield an ARR of 0.1 and an NNT of 10 patients. When limiting this analysis to the norfloxacin trials alone, the pooled RR is 0.21 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.44) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality<BR/>
</B>Pooled analysis achieved statistical significance with regard to prevention of mortality, RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Overall mortality added up to 64 patients among 270 control patients (23%, 95% CI 18% to 29%). The point estimate NNT was 11. Mortality was not significantly reduced when limiting the analysis to the four norfloxacin trials (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Overall infection rate</B>
<BR/>Only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2007</LINK>) reported the overall infection rate, which was significantly lower in each trial in the treatment group. Combining the results of these trials gave similar results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events<BR/>
</B>The pooled risk of adverse events among treated patients was not significantly greater than that among patients treated with either placebo or no treatment. In six trials, there were eight adverse events (six in the treatment group and one in the control group) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). These included the following: nausea, hypersomnia, oro-oesophageal candidiasis, headache with fatigue, diarrhoea, skin rash, and drug fever.</P>
<P>
<B>Readmission rates</B>
<BR/>Readmission rates were only reported in <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Publication bias<BR/>
</B>When assessing the trials for publication bias we found that the regression asymmetry test suggested a skewed funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) when examining the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (P = 0.029). Calculating the fail-safe N resulted in the need for 38 trials with relative risk of 1 (no effect) in order to increase the pooled RR to 0.80 and 88 such trails in order to increase the overall RR to 0.90. When examining the data for mortality (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) there appears to be less likelihood of publication bias with the regression asymmetry test being non-significant (P = 0.296).</P>

</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK> reported that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 6 out of 40 (15%) patients in the norfloxacin group and in 12 out of 39 (31%) patients in the rufloxacin group (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.17). Three (7.5%) patients in the norfloxacin group and five (12.8%) patients in the rufloxacin group died during the trial period (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.28). The overall number of infections in the norfloxacin group was 13 (32%), including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 18 (46%) in the rufloxacin group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.23). Readmissions occurred in 37 instances among the 33 patients in the norfloxacin group and in 41 instances among the 29 patients in the rufloxacin group. Three patients in each group were diagnosed with adverse events including severe diarrhoea, granulocytopenia, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, and headache.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK> reported that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 3 out of 32 patients in the norfloxacin group (9%) and in 4 out of 25 patients in the sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim group (16%), RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.14 to 2.38). Seven patients (22%) in the norfloxacin group and 5 patients (20%) in the sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim group died during the trial period, RR of 1.09 (95% CI 0.39 to 3.04). The overall number of infections in the norfloxacin group was 13 (41%), including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 10 (40%) in the sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim group, RR 1.02, 0.54 to1.92. There were no data given regarding readmissions. There were no adverse events in the norfloxacin group. Five patients in the sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim group experienced adverse events, including skin rash in one patient, two patients with epigastric pain, and two patients with worsening renal function.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Sponatenous bacterial peritonitis incidence rates</B>
<BR/>Six trials provided mean lengths of follow-up per randomisation group (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terg 2008</LINK>). These data enable us to calculate yearly incidence rates for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Among patients treated with norfloxacin the risk amounts to 15.6% per year (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>). Among patients in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>), the one-year risk is 50%. The data from <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK> indicate a 42% one-year risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among patients given rufloxacin, while <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK> presents a 27% risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis per year among patients treated with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole.</P>

<B>Changes in intestinal flora</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> found that there was eradication of aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the intestinal flora, without change of concentration of gram-positive cocci among patients treated with norfloxacin, but not among those given placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK> reported that there was no acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin and no modification of faecal flora gram-positive cocci. <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK> obtained stool samples from 46 patients, 24 from the norfloxacin group and 22 patients from the placebo group. Ten patients from the norfloxacin group produced 12 resistant organisms, not present on baseline faecal. None caused clinical infection. In the placebo group, three resistant strains were detected. <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK> reported a colony count decrease of at least two log units which was observed in four patients in the norfloxacin group and in one patient in the rufloxacin group. No complete eradication of <I>Escherichia coli</I> was seen in either group. In all patients in whom there were no nalidixic acid resistant strains at the beginning of the trial, resistant strains were recovered during the follow-up. In six patients (whose treatment regimen was not specified), ciprofloxacin resistance was detected. Repetitive polymerase chain reaction found that two of the ciprofloxacin resistant strains were identical to a susceptible strain at the beginning of the trial.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-10 13:46:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Our review presents findings suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis prevents spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites and decreases mortality. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment seems to be associated with negligible adverse events, which might not actually occur at increased rates.<BR/>
<BR/>In this review we could not examine all our preliminary specified outcomes. There were insufficient data to determine which antibiotic is most effective. Trials did not assess quality of life. There seemed to be only two participants with life-threatening adverse events, ie, decreased renal function events in the trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2005</LINK>). There were no data allowing an economic analysis to be performed, and collecting the necessary data was beyond the scope of this review. Subgroup data were not provided in the trials to allow subgroup analysis of high-risk patients. Data were also not available for analysis of subgroups according to previous antibiotic treatment.<BR/>
<BR/>Unfortunately, most trials had low methodology quality. Insufficient data regarding randomisation methods was the most prevalent reason. We attempted to contact all authors of all trials for additional information. Our analysis of the probability that the randomisation produced their respective group characteristics indicate that the probability that true randomisation occurred in all trials is small, to the extent that it can be deemed highly unlikely. The probability that the groups turned out the way they did is very small. This does not imply that false data were presented regarding randomisation, but perhaps it indicates that poor or unsuccessful randomisation methods were employed. Better reporting might have increased methodology level and increased our confidence that true successful randomisation took place.<BR/>
<BR/>All the trials reviewed were relatively small. In six trials, sample size calculation were presented and in all these trials, the desired sample size was attained. Given our findings - a RR of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 0.20 among treated patients and a 50% risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among untreated patients - the sample sizes in these trials were adequate.<BR/>
<BR/>Our assessment of possible bias was inconclusive. While there seems to have been publication bias, favouring trials with results, which promote the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, the fail-safe N test shows that a considerable amount of trials with null results are required to change the overall pooled result. Of note, this test is limited because it does not account for trial sizes required for pooling an overall estimate that agrees with the null hypothesis.<BR/>
<BR/>Previous high quality literature exists regarding antibiotic prophylaxis among cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2002</LINK>). Currently, there appears to be a consensus that cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding should be provided with prophylactic treatment. However, the adverse consequences associated with emergence of resistant strains hovers above and cannot be neglected (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>A previous review of antibiotic prophylaxis including cirrhotic patients, not differentiating between their risk profiles, found that antibiotic prophylaxis prevented overall mortality and bacterial infection mortality rates. In this review, subgroup analysis of patients without gastrointestinal bleeding did not find a significant decrease in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2003</LINK>). Non-randomised studies examining spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prevention among patients without gastrointestinal bleeding have suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis benefits cirrhotic patients with ascites (<LINK REF="REF-Tito-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tito 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andreu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toledo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toledo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llovet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 1997</LINK>). A previous meta-analysis of this topic included four trials (all included in this review) and presented pooled results showing reduction of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis incidence and mortality. However this meta-analysis did not include intention-to-treat data (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The International Ascites Club recommends the use of oral norfloxacin 400 mg/day among patients recovering from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, without gastrointestinal bleeding, but is more cautious with recommending it to patients who had not experienced previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis events with low protein ascites. Patients without low protein ascites were recommended not to be given antibiotic prophylaxis but there is a low level of evidence to support this recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Rimola-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimola 2000</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Three economic analyses address this issue, all presenting findings in which spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prevention with antibiotics seemed to be the prudent choice. <LINK REF="REF-Younossi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Younossi 1997</LINK> showed that when assuming a 68% probability of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis per year among patients not treated, prophylaxis was dominant when reducing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis incidence by at least 10%. <LINK REF="REF-Inadomi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inadomi 1997</LINK> assumed annual spontaneous bacterial peritonitis incidence rates among patients without prophylaxis were 28%, 41%, and 69% among patients with no previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, low protein ascites, and with previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis events, respectively. Antibiotic prophylaxis was assumed to reduce these rates to 12%, 16%, and 20%, respectively. In this analysis, the greater the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the more cost-effective was the prophylaxis. Saving ranged from a minimum of $ 2216 per year to $ 9251. <LINK REF="REF-Das-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 1998</LINK> assessed three competing strategies - no prophylaxis, total prophylaxis, and selective high-risk patient prophylaxis. In this analysis they assumed annual risks of 30% with no prophylaxis, and 3% with prophylaxis. Their analysis found that selective prophylaxis of high risk patients was the dominant choice.<BR/>
<BR/>As presented in our results, oral norfloxacin prophylaxis was associated with an overall one-year spontaneous bacterial peritonitis rate of 15%. This includes two trials in which there were no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis events among the norfloxacin group (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sandhu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhu 2005</LINK> compared norfloxacin with and without cisapride for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prevention. In their trial the annual rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among the norfloxacin group was 56.8% compared to the norfloxacin and 21.7% in the cisapride group. These variations probably results from variations in the patients included (cirrhosis etiologies, recruitment from outpatient clinics/hospitalised patients, primary versus. secondary prevention), emergence of resistance to antibiotics over time and the quality of care received. Still, we found no significant heterogeneity among the trials reviewed with regard to prophylaxis effect. This might be independent of the varying factors.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Llovet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 1997</LINK> described a historical cohort study derived from 229 patients admitted to hospital with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, assessing which had been previously treated with norfloxacin as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis or as upper respiratory tract infection prophylaxis (n = 36). They demonstrated that in patients with culture-positive spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the causative agents were different (more gram-positive pathogens) when comparing patients who were previously treated with norfloxacin compared to those who were not and presented data suggesting that patients treated with prophylaxis had better prognosis when suffering from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (less renal impairment and no immediate mortality events). These findings are consistent with the <LINK REF="STD-Gines-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gines 1990</LINK> results (eradication of aerobic gram-negative bacilli and not gram- positive bacteria among patients treated with norfloxacin), but not with <LINK REF="STD-Rolachon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rolachon 1995</LINK> who found no flora modifications. <LINK REF="STD-Grange-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grange 1998</LINK> reported high resistant rates to the provided antibiotics among the treated group as did <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2002</LINK>, who also reported that there was no complete eradication of <I>Escherichia coli</I>.<BR/>
<BR/>These findings suggest that thought should be given to empirical treatment given to patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis who are on prophylactic treatment. Assuming that the probability of gram-positive agents are more likely and that resistance rate to fluoroquinolones is also probable, use of broad spectrum beta-lactams is probably indicated. The evidence for this common empirical antibiotic prescription practice is weak (<LINK REF="REF-Chavez_x002d_Tapia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chavez-Tapia 2009</LINK>). Empirical treatment should also account for inducible cross resistance, which might occur. Knowledge of resistance trends in the patient's environment will guide appropriate empirical treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.<BR/>
<BR/>Having reviewed previous literature and showing that there seems to be an overall consistency in the results suggesting our findings are probably valid, other considerations should prompt some skepticism. <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2003</LINK> found similar findings of evidence of publication bias when examining the funnel plot or their systemic review and meta-analysis. These should not be overlooked. Poor quality of trials should also raise some caution before confident guidelines are published.<BR/>
<BR/>Selective intestinal decontamination has been assessed in various other clinical scenarios including trauma patients (<LINK REF="REF-Stoutenbeek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoutenbeek 2007</LINK>), patients undergoing haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Trifilio-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trifilio 2004</LINK>), ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-File-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">File 2007</LINK>), and other critically ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jonge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jonge 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Jonge-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jonge 2005</LINK>). Because the intestinal tract inherently houses bacteria, the theory that decreasing its mass as a preventive strategy can be considered logical. However, basic microbiological theory would maintain that it would not take long for resistant organisms and bacterial strains to predominate and cause no less of a threat while leaving the patient with less treatment possibilities. This issue has been in continuous debate in the medical literature and remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-van-Belkum-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Belkum 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silvestri-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvestri 2006</LINK>). The over-all effect of increasing prevalence of resistant pathogens might eventually outweigh potential benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Bonten-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonten 2006</LINK>). The trials included in this review followed most patients for periods not longer than 12 months. Prophylaxis treatment, with no actual cessation period, will, in all likelihood, promote the overgrowth of resistant strains in the treated patients, which will eventually put the patients again at risk. Therefore, extreme caution should be practiced by decision makers and professional societies before they initiate antibiotic prophylaxis promotion of any sort.<BR/>

<P>The results of this review are consistent with previous findings that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among cirrhotic patients. In this review we assessed patients not suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding, and previous reviews assessed patients who were. These conclusions are hampered by the poor quality of the trials, which currently exist and the consistent findings suggesting publication bias. Potential harm might occur due to disseminated use of antibiotic treatment because the emergence of resistant bacteria can eventually undermine the prophylaxis goals and endanger cirrhotic patients. Given the ever increasing burden of resistant pathogens and the limited validity of the results, it seems that the wiser choice would be not to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients suffering from cirrhosis.</P>

<P>Primarily, randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias are in great need, with detailed reporting of methods, and with appropriate design and performance. Trials should also assess whether prophylaxis strategies are beneficial for cirrhotic patients of all risk groups and should assess the length of time that such modalities should be recommended.</P>

<P>The objectives of the original protocol were "to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial infections and improvement of survival in cirrhotic patients with ascites." This was actually done; however, we must note that the data in the reviewed trials were very poor with regard to consistency of data methodology and meaning with regard to such outcomes as total infections. We, therefore, focused more on the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Data relating to overall infection rates were pooled and presented; however, they are not the primary outcome of this review. Mortality data were assessed. Data regarding which antibiotic is the best choice for prophylaxis could not be assessed - again due to lack of data in the literature.</P>
<P>We did not perform cost and economic analyses in this review. Again, data are too scarce and such analyses would require too many theoretical assumptions, which would, at best reflect a too specific location and time to allow extrapolation, rendering this analysis useless for its readers.</P>
<P>While preparing the review, the team who published the 2004 protocol was joined by two additional members who helped complete the review and keep it up to date (MJC, SB).</P>
<P>As written above in the methods sections, we chose to add several methods of analysis in order to assess and present useful measures of association and also assess the likelihood of successful true randomisation.</P>
<P>Another important point is the inclusion of two trials in which there were in fact patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. We chose to include these two trials since the proportion of gastrointestinal bleeders was very small and their overall weight in the pooled analysis is of little, if any, significance. This was, however, an arbitrary decision made during the review process.</P>
<P>We believe that these changes were within acceptable limits and helped us produce a better review.</P>

<P>The protocol of B Bernard, JD Grange, E Nguyen Khac, C Regimbeau, X Amiot, P Opolon, and T Poynard 'Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with ascites' was first published on The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 1999. Since the authors could not proceed with their work on the review, it was overtaken by Cohen MJ, Sahar T, Benenson S, Elinav E, Brezis M, Soares-Weiser K. The new team of authors updated the protocol before continuing with the review.<BR/>

<B>Low quality (++OO):</B> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.<BR/>
<B>Very low quality (+OOO):</B> We are very uncertain about the estimate.</P>
<P>1. As explained in the review, only two trials scored high on methodology, and the results of the randomisation suggest that true randomisation was probably not achieved.</P>
<P>2. The pooled analyses relate to the use of any antibiotic compared with placebo.</P>
<P>3. Not all trials were large, and a significant proportion of them had confidence intervals, which allow room to conclude that there might not be a true effect since the results were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>4. As suggested by the funnel plot.</P>
<P>5. The pooled RR for benefit is 0.20.</P>
<P>6. Although the funnel plot for the mortality data does not suggest publication bias, it was not the primary outcome in the trials, and as suggested from the spontaneous bacterial peritonitis data, publication bias probably exists.</P>
