<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In type 2 diabetes mellitus, impairment of insulin secretion is an important component of the disease. The meglitinide analogues ("meglitinides") are a class of oral antidiabetic agents that increase insulin secretion in the pancreas. The properties of this class of drug suggest that they have the potential to produce a rapid, short-lived insulin output. Two analogues are currently available for clinical use: repaglinide and nateglinide. Altogether 15 studies were included in this review, eight of the studies used repaglinide as the study drug and five used nateglinide. Two compared the two meglitinides to one another. In total, 3781 people participated in the 15 studies which mainly lasted between 10 and 24 weeks (one study had a duration of 52 weeks).<BR/>No studies reported the effect of meglitinides on mortality or diabetes related complications. In the eleven studies comparing meglitinides to placebo, both repaglinide and nateglinide resulted in an improved blood sugar control. Weight gain was generally greater in those treated with meglitinides compared with metformin (up to three kg in three months), another oral antidiabetic drug. Here, diarrhoea occurred less frequently and hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently but rarely severely enough as to require assistance. <BR/>Meglitinides may offer an alternative oral hypoglycaemic agent of similar potency to metformin, and may be indicated where side effects of metformin are intolerable (in particular persistent diarrhoea) or where metformin is contraindicated. However, there is no evidence available yet to indicate what effect meglitinides will have on important long-term outcomes, in particular, on mortality. As yet, the experience with meglitinides in terms of side effects is limited. Results from other Cochrane review groups may provide additional information about the potential role of meglitinides in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. </P>

<P>Fifteen trials involving 3781 participants were included. No studies reported the effect of meglitinides on mortality or morbidity. In the eleven studies comparing meglitinides to placebo, both repaglinide and nateglinide resulted in a reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin (0.1% to 2.1% reduction in HbA1c for repaglinide; 0.2% to 0.6% for nateglinide). Only two trials compared repaglinide to nateglinide (342 participants), with greater reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin in those receiving repaglinide. Repaglinide (248 participants in three trials) had a similar degree of effect in reducing glycosylated haemoglobin as metformin. Nateglinide had a similar or slightly less marked effect on glycosylated haemoglobin than metformin (one study, 355 participants). Weight gain was generally greater in those treated with meglitinides compared with metformin (up to three kg in three months). Diarrhoea occurred less frequently and hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently but rarely severely enough as to require assistance.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:05:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with<BR/>disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups - CRGs'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>In type 2 diabetes mellitus, compromise of insulin secreting ß-islet cell function in the pancreas is an important component of the disease, along with increased insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-De-Fronzo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Fronzo 1999</LINK>). The UK Prospective Diabetes Study demonstrated that continued loss of ß cell function determines the progressive deterioration in blood glucose control (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1995</LINK>). The loss of ability to generate a rapid, early phase, release of insulin from ß cells, in response to a glucose load (that is a meal), is recognised among type 2 diabetes patients and among those at high risk of developing the disease (that is first degree relatives of type 2 diabetes patients, women with a history of gestational diabetes) (<LINK REF="REF-Dornhurst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dornhurst 2001</LINK>). There is evidence to support the importance of the early phase of insulin release, normally occurring within minutes after a glucose load, in the control of postprandial blood glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Gerich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerich 2003</LINK>). It has been suggested that there may be a specific benefit in lowering post prandial glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Bastyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bastyr 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breuer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breuer 2000</LINK>). The evidence for this comes from epidemiological studies, which were used for decisions on classification of diabetes, such as DECODE (<LINK REF="REF-DECODE-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DECODE 1999</LINK>). These studies showed that the plasma glucose level, after a glucose load of 75 g, was a better predictor of heart disease than fasting glucose levels. However, the studies mainly involved oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in people without diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vegt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vegt 1999</LINK>). During an OGTT, glucose levels are measured at intervals after the consumption of an oral glucose load. The DECODE study reported that glucose levels, measured at two hours after an oral glucose load, were independently related to mortality. Even if fasting plasma glucose was normal (under 6.1 mmol/L), rising glucose levels at two hours were a predictor of an increase in ischaemic heart disease. The DECODE study also noted that 31% of people with abnormal two hour OGTT glucose levels that were diagnostic of diabetes mellitus had normal fasting plasma glucose levels.<BR/>Bonora and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Bonora-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonora 2001</LINK>) showed that, in people with type 2 diabetes, elevated glucose levels after meals were seen in patients whose glycosylated haemoglobin was normal and that glycosylated haemoglobin was more closely related to preprandial than postprandial glucose levels. This is presumed to be an effect of duration, in that preprandial levels correlate more closely with mean 24 hour glucose levels. Conversely, Bastyr and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Bastyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bastyr 2000</LINK>) found that a strategy of focusing on lowering postprandial glucose (using insulin lispro) had more effect on HbA1c than reduction of fasting plasma glucose using bedtime NPH insulin. In a recent review of the topic, Gerich and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Gerich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerich 2003</LINK>) concluded that postprandial glucose was a greater risk factor for cardiovascular disease than fasting plasma glucose. <LINK REF="REF-Hanefeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanefeld 1996</LINK> found that the incidence of myocardial infarction, in an 11-year follow-up study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, was associated with increased postprandial glucose but not fasting plasma glucose.<BR/>Increased two-hour OGTT levels may reflect insulin resistance, whereas high fasting plasma glucose reflects beta-cell dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Yudkin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yudkin 1994</LINK>). Sulphonylureas mainly improve late insulin release, whereas the meglitinides affect early insulin release. Metformin works by reducing hepatic over-production of glucose, and the glitazones by increasing peripheral glucose utilisation. <LINK REF="REF-Gerich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerich 2003</LINK> argued that the sulphonylureas, glitazones, and metformin will act mainly to reduce fasting and other non-prandial levels, and that the most effective drugs for reducing postprandial glucose are short-acting insulins and the meglitinides. The meglitinides may be of particular value in patients with insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Shiba-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiba 2003</LINK>).<BR/>However, for reduction of postprandial glucose to be accepted as a therapeutic goal in addition to glycosylated haemoglobin, it is not enough to show a correlation between postprandial glucose and ischaemic heart disease. Evidence that reducing postprandial glucose (independently of glycosylated haemoglobin) will reduce ischaemic heart disease events is also needed. Postprandial glucose may reflect a more general metabolic problem, and may be a correlate, not a cause, of ischaemic heart disease.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-07 19:15:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The meglitinide analogues are a class of oral hypoglycaemic agents that increase insulin secretion by binding to specific sites on the sulphonylurea receptor found on insulin secreting ß islet cells in the pancreas. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this class of drug suggest they have the potential to produce a rapid, short-lived insulin secretary response (<LINK REF="REF-Landgraf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landgraf 2000</LINK>). These properties, along with clinical trial evidence, supports the potential role of meglitinide analogues in augmenting the early phase insulin release and, therefore, postprandial glucose control (<LINK REF="REF-Dornhurst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dornhurst 2001</LINK>). Two analogues are currently available for clinical use: repaglinide and nateglinide. While the chemical structures and mechanisms differ between these agents, the effect on early phase insulin release is similar, with a rapid rise in insulin concentrations after dosing and a short half-life. Early trial evidence supports their effect in reduction of postprandial glucose and reduction in hypoglycaemic episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Landgraf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landgraf 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Heterogeneity was tested for using the Z score and the &#967;<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with significance being set at &#945; &lt; 0.1. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used to estimate the proportion of the total variation in study estimates that could be explained by heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Where significant heterogeneity was found, it was considered to be unreasonable to assume that there was one 'true' effect underlying the data, that was constant across different populations, and therefore no summary statistic was calculated.</P>

<P>The results are presented by comparator, examining the evidence of efficacy by first reviewing the studies comparing meglitinide monotherapy to a placebo. Secondly, the comparison of the two meglitinides currently licensed for use provided us with information as to whether the therapies could be considered together in future comparisons or whether their properties were sufficiently different as to require separate consideration. Finally, comparisons with metformin were undertaken. Three potential treatment regimens were anticipated: use of meglitinides as monotherapy, use of meglitinides in combination with metformin, use of meglitinides in combination with insulin.

<P>From review of the placebo studies, nateglinide 120 mg produced a reduction in HbA1c over 12 to 24 weeks that was of borderline clinical significance (taken as 0.5%). Reporting of adverse events was limited in the included studies, but no major adverse events or hypoglycaemic episodes were reported.<BR/>While any comparison of the effect on HbA1c for repaglinide and nateglinide must be made with caution, as no direct comparison has been made in these studies, there is evidence that the clinical effects of the two drugs may differ. The next but one section of this review concentrates on the evidence obtained from comparing the two drugs in head to head trials.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Marre-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marre 2002</LINK> reported a mean difference in weight gain comparing the 120 mg nateglinide treatment group and the placebo treatment group, when all participants were receiving metformin, of +0.9 kg (95%CI 0.4 to 1.5) additional gain in the nateglinide group.

In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Horton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 2000</LINK>) there were 45 reports (five confirmed) for combination therapy versus 18 reports (one confirmed) in the metformin monotherapy group.</P>

<P>Marre 2002 reported that combination treatment with nateglinide produced the greatest reduction in HbA1c among those with a baseline HbA1c of greater than 9.5% (reduction of 1.4%, metformin alone data not reported). Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Horton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 2000</LINK> identified the largest reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin, compared with placebo, among those with baseline HbA1c of greater than 9.5% (reduction of 2.5% with combination therapy versus 1.5% with metformin alone; relative to placebo).<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Marre-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marre 2002</LINK> only included participants previously treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents but <LINK REF="STD-Horton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 2000</LINK> did not separate subgroups by prior treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary</HEADING>
<P>Both studies, comparing nateglinide in combination with metformin, to metformin monotherapy reported reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin that are of clinical significance. However, since no point estimates were provided (with measures of variance), it is not possible to combine the data in the form of a meta-analysis. While there was evidence that the combination therapy resulted in more hypoglycaemia, there were no severe hypoglycaemic episodes. Adverse events were similar for combination therapy and metformin alone.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:04:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>In order to evaluate the role of meglitinide analogues in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we present a systematic review of the evidence for a number of comparators thought to provide the most relevant information to clinical practice.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:04:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>As yet, no data are available about the impact of meglitinides on mortality or diabetes complications. For this review, a clinically significant reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin was taken to be a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c. None of the studies included in the review reported what level of glycosylated haemoglobin reduction would have been considered to be of clinical significance by the trialists. It is possible that this information was included in their power calculations but it was not reported separately. From a public health perspective, an epidemiological investigation of the UKPDS reported that a 1% reduction in HbA1c was estimated to result in a 21% reduction in diabetes related complications or deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>).<BR/>The placebo versus meglitinides studies demonstrated that both repaglinide and nateglinide are efficacious, producing both statistically and clinically significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin, at least in the short term (10 to 24 weeks). Two studies compared repaglinide to nateglinide, again demonstrating a clinically significant reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin for both treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2004</LINK>). There was sufficient difference in effect on glycosylated haemoglobin between the two drugs that consideration of the two meglitinides together, when comparing to other hypoglycaemic agents, was considered to be inappropriate. This is a finding that is in keeping with evidence from reviews of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that suggest that nateglinide binds more rapidly and dissociates more quickly with the receptor, than repaglinide (<LINK REF="REF-Dornhurst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dornhurst 2001</LINK>). This lower binding affinity may explain the lower potency, reflected in the higher doses of nateglinide required for therapy, and the clinical effect on glycosylated haemoglobin. In theory, it is possible that the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide could be an advantage clinically if the shorter action than repaglinide led to fewer hypoglycaemic episodes but only if the lesser potency was acceptable, as it may be in combination therapies.</P>
<P>When compared to metformin monotherapy, both repaglinide and nateglinide produce a similar (or slightly smaller) reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin than metformin. The combination of metformin with a meglitinide produced a clinically significant additional reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin when compared to metformin monotherapy. Only one trial considered the addition of meglitinides to insulin therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Furlong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Furlong 2002</LINK>). However, from this there was evidence that metformin in combination with insulin was more effective in reducing glycosylated haemoglobin than repaglinide in combination with insulin. The maximum follow up in any of the trials was one year, with a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Derosa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Derosa 2003</LINK>) providing some evidence to support an ongoing reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin with meglitinide therapy, under trial conditions, at one year.</P>
<P>Only two studies presented information about quality of life comparing repaglinide to placebo and repaglinide plus insulin to metformin plus insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Furlong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Furlong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2001</LINK>). The authors of both studies reported no substantial change in quality of life using a variety of validated diseases specific and non specific tools. Treatment satisfaction, measured using the WHO Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, improved statistically significantly in those treated with repaglinide alone, and when compared with those treated with placebo. When combined with insulin, patient satisfaction improved with the metformin combination but deteriorated with the repaglinide combination. The clinical significance of the changes observed is not clear and may relate to the previous therapy experiences and "expectations" of new treatments where the study was an open label trial (<LINK REF="STD-Furlong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Furlong 2002</LINK>). From the limited evidence available, it does not appear that the introduction of repaglinide causes any substantial change in quality of life.</P>
<P>Increasing weight in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus is recognised to lead to increased insulin resistance and, therefore, deteriorating diabetic control. Weight change is, therefore, an important factor in therapy choice. Metformin is favoured for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in obese patients, because of its beneficial effect on weight (<LINK REF="REF-Kirpichnikov--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirpichnikov 2002</LINK>). For both repaglinide and nateglinide, in almost all studies where weight was reported, weight gains occurred. Where meglitinides were compared directly to metformin, those treated with metformin experienced the greater weight losses.</P>
<P>Given the evidence to support the similar degree of effect on glycosylated haemoglobin by the meglitinides and metformin, a major issue in choosing therapy will be the side effect profile of the drugs. A well recognised side effect of metformin therapy is diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Kirpichnikov--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirpichnikov 2002</LINK>). In the trial setting, 20% to 30% of participants receiving metformin reported diarrhoea. This was lower in studies recruiting only patients who were already long-term metformin users, presumably because those severely affected by diarrhoea have been prevented from using metformin on a long-term basis. In the clinical setting, persistent diarrhoea is reported to be an important cause of poor therapy compliance and would be an indication for changing to an alternative therapy. Evidence from the meglitinide trials with metformin comparison arms suggests that both repaglinide and nateglinide produce fewer gastrointestinal adverse events including less diarrhoea. There was no evidence of serious adverse events associated with meglitinides. However, the longest reported follow up was 12 months and the total number of patients exposed to meglitinides in trials included in this review, was relatively small (repaglinide n = 1029; nateglinide n = 1610). A number of studies reported cardiovascular deaths in the meglitinide treated groups. At this stage there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular complications among meglitinide treated patients with diabetes, and as the risk of cardiovascular disease is substantially increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Watkins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 2003</LINK>), it is not unexpected that such studies report deaths.</P>
<P>While obtaining improvements in glycosylated haemoglobin is a priority in terms of improving long-term survival, it cannot be at the expense of unacceptable hypoglycaemia. There are four components to hypoglycaemia that provide useful comparison: frequency, severity, lack of awareness and timing. None of the studies reported any severe hypoglycaemic events (where severe was defined as requiring assistance). All the trials reported hypoglycaemia based on patient symptoms. None discussed lack of hypoglycaemia awareness. Only a few of the studies indicated the timing of hypoglycaemic episodes, and the authors stated that no hypoglycaemia occurred at night (in keeping with the relatively short half life of the meglitinides) (<LINK REF="REF-Dornhurst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dornhurst 2001</LINK>). As might be expected, more hypoglycaemia was reported in those treated with meglitinides than those receiving a placebo. In the two 'head to head' trials of repaglinide versus nateglinide, fewer participants treated with nateglinide reported hypoglycaemia symptoms (2% versus 7%). Compared to metformin, participants receiving meglitinides reported more hypoglycaemia symptoms.</P>
<P>At the present time only one trial reported follow up for longer than six months. No studies have reported long-term outcomes such as mortality or morbidity.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:04:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>It is difficult to comment on the representativeness of the participants in the trials identified. Little detailed information about the participants was presented. Apart from one study, most of the trials have largely had Caucasian participants. Age, sex and BMI of participants were in keeping with what might be expected in clinical practice. However, it should be noted that patients with existing complications of diabetes - cardiovascular disease or renal disease, or with hepatic disease were, in general, excluded from the studies. It should also be noted that it is difficult to say how typical patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who participate in clinical trials, may be of the wider population with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:04:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The review currently only includes comparisons of meglitinides with metformin (plus or minus insulin). Comparisons with other oral hypoglycaemic agents are currently being undertaken by other Cochrane review teams and may be referenced by this review once available. A wide search of electronic reference databases was conducted, and the drug companies contacted for additional information. No unpublished study data were identified. The main limitations for interpreting the results of this review relate to the relatively poor reporting of the factors important for assessing quality of the trials such as allocation concealment, randomisation methodology and blinding methods. As a result it was difficult to exclude the possibility of biases; a particular issue because all available trials have been funded by the pharmaceutical companies producing meglitinides.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:04:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>A number of reviews (of variable quality <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) have been published, describing the evidence of the efficacy of meglitinides for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We restricted our review of their findings to those published after 2000. The main findings of these reviews were in keeping with this systematic review. They reported clinically significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin compared with placebo and approximate equivalency to metformin and sulphonylureas. The potential benefit from greater flexibility in dosing regimens was highlighted in one review (<LINK REF="REF-Inzucchi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inzucchi 2002</LINK>). We found few studies that made any attempt to assess quality of life or treatment satisfaction but the limited evidence available did not support the increased potential for flexibility in dosing resulting in improved treatment satisfaction or quality of life. Several authors highlighted the need to consider the place of meglitinides in the existing treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and where cost was considered, they recognised that meglitinides role in therapy was not clear.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Meglitinides may offer an alternative oral hypoglycaemic agent of similar potency to metformin, and may be indicated where side effects of metformin are intolerable (in particular persistent diarrhoea) or where metformin is contraindicated. However, there is no evidence available yet to indicate what effect meglitinides will have on important long-term outcomes, in particular, on mortality. Meglitinides do appear to result in more hypoglycaemia and weight gain than metformin, and are substantially more expensive. For metformin, there is long experience of use in many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and serious side effects are rare. As yet, the experience with meglitinides in terms of adverse events is limited. Results from other Cochrane review groups may provide additional information about the potential role of meglitinides in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research needs can be divided into three areas: safety, efficacy and economics:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Safety: Long-term follow up (years) of large numbers of patients using meglitinides are required to assess safety. Large observational studies could provide this information. A review of the evidence of safety from currently available trials and observation cohorts would provide some more information regarding potential safety while long-term follow up is undertaken.</LI>
<LI>Efficacy: Long-term outcomes such as mortality and morbidity from diabetes associated complications require to be assessed. Independent studies of the comparison of repaglinide with nateglinide would afford better assessment of the comparability of the two meglitinides.</LI>
<LI>Economics: Inclusion of cost, quality of life and long-term outcomes in future RCTs are required assess the cost-effectiveness of meglitinides. Flexibility of treatment regimens has been used for marketing the meglitinides. It is not clear, from the current evidence, how much of gain in terms of quality of life or treatment satisfaction, this potential flexibility actually offers.</LI>
