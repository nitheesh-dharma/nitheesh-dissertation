<P>Chronic hepatitis B is a very common infectious disease leading to chronic liver disease, affecting around 350 million people all over the world. Liver transplantation is often the only viable treatment option. Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the liver graft is one of the grave complications of liver transplantation, and to prevent it, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) seem associated with improved survival. HBIg and/or antiviral drugs are given alone or in combination after liver transplantation. We attempted to identify the optimal preventive treatment option.</P>
<P>We found only four randomised clinical trials that compared different prophylactic regimens in 136 participants. None of the trials compared the same prophylaxis regimen. In each individual trial no significant differences were detected with regard to patients' survival after transplantation, HBV recurrence, or the recurrence of liver disease. All trials were too small to detect a difference, if it existed.</P>
<P>Prevention of HBV recurrence following liver transplantation is currently non-evidence based. Practice is to administer a combination of HBIg and an antiviral drug. Randomised clinical trials are needed to examine this practice.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed the trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors whenever information was lacking. We collected information on adverse events.

<P>Four trials, recruiting 136 participants, were included. Two trials compared lamivudine alone versus HBIg alone. Randomisation was performed one week after transplantation in one of the trials and after six months after transplantation in another; from transplantation until randomisation, HBIg alone was given to all patients in the two trials. A third trial compared combination treatment with lamivudine and HBIg versus lamivudine alone after one month of combination treatment, and a fourth trial compared the combination of lamivudine and HBIg versus a combination of lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil after at least 12-month of lamivudine and HBIg combination treatment. Statistically significant differences were not detected in any of the comparisons and outcomes. All trials were open-labelled, and none of the trials were adequately powered to show a difference in HBV recurrence. No meta-analyses were performed since the identified trials assessed different comparisons.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-17 09:47:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Chronic hepatitis B is a very common infectious disease, causing chronic liver disease in around 350 million people all over the world. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes a wide spectrum of manifestations, ranging from an apparently healthy carrier state to acute self-limited or fulminant hepatitis and chronic liver disease. Chronic hepatitis B is associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The lifetime risk of death due to these complications is 25% to 40% in patients with chronic hepatitis B (<LINK REF="REF-Realdi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Realdi 1994</LINK>). Orthotopic liver transplantation is often the only viable treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease.</P>
<P>Recurrence of HBV infection in the liver graft was the main problem for patients undergoing liver transplantation for HBV cirrhosis (<LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>). Without the use of immunoprophylaxis, the cumulative proportion of HBV recurrence in the liver graft is above 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terrault-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terrault 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrillo 2001</LINK>). Accordingly, performing liver transplantation in patients with chronic hepatitis B was not widely accepted prior to the use of immunoprophylaxis with immunoglobulin (HBIg) and/or antiviral agents (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2003</LINK>). In patients who are liver transplanted due to hepatitis B, the one- and five-year survival rates were 73% and 44% compared to 85% and 60% in non-HBV liver transplanted patients (<LINK REF="REF-Todo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poterucha-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poterucha 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies have shown that using hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIg) for six months or more after transplantation reduced the frequency of recurrent HBV infection and improved the survival of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terrault-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terrault 1997</LINK>). The actuarial five-year survival of patients who received HBIg was 80% compared to only 47% in patients who received no prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 1993</LINK>). Today, HBIg is considered the primary means of immunoprophylaxis after liver transplantations. There is wide agreement that when given alone, it must be given indefinitely to remain effective (<LINK REF="REF-Perrillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrillo 2001</LINK>). However, long-term use of HBIg entails several problems, particularly lack of effectiveness in all patients, parenteral administration, adverse effects, and cost. There is also concern that long standing use of HBIg can lead to emergence of genetic HBV mutants, resistant to neutralisation by HBIg (<LINK REF="REF-Terrault-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terrault 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrillo 2001</LINK>). Thus, it is necessary to find alternative approaches for preventing post-transplantation HBV infection.</P>
<P>Lamivudine, a nucleoside analogue, which inhibits HBV replication, is considered an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B. In patients with chronic hepatitis B, the use of lamivudine leads to clinical, serological, biochemical, and histological improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lok-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL 2009</LINK>). Several non-randomised studies have shown that lamivudine may also be effective for treating HBV recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Ari-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Ari 1997</LINK>) and for preventing recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation, with or without the use of HBIg (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grellier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grellier 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrillo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrillo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naoumov 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrillo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>). The actuarial five years survival of patients who received lamivudine was 80% versus only 47% in patients who received no prophylaxis in the European trial conducted by Samuel (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrillo 2001</LINK>). Lamivudine has several advantages compared to HBIg: it is a cheaper oral drug and seems safe. The main disadvantage of lamivudine is the development of YMDD mutants resistant to the drug, which limit its long-term efficacy with recurrence rates of 25% after one year following liver transplantation and possibly higher thereafter (<LINK REF="REF-Grellier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grellier 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mutimer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutimer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adefovir dipivoxil, another nucleotide analogue, is also considered to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B (<LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marcellin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcellin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lok-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL 2009</LINK>). Adefovir dipivoxil significantly improves virologic and biochemical markers as well as liver histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Adefovir dipivoxil offers advantages over other chronic hepatitis B treatment options: it maintains activity against lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B, has good efficacy against HBe antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B, and has minimal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Rivkin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivkin 2004</LINK>). In a large open-label multicentre study adefovir dipivoxil was shown to result in significant improvements in virologic and biochemical biomarkers, as well as clinical outcomes in patients with recurrent HBV infection post-liver transplantation and evidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV (<LINK REF="REF-Schiff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiff 2003</LINK>). After liver transplantation, adefovir dipivoxil is still considered only a rescue therapy for patients with lamivudine resistance and not as first line therapy, with or without HBIg (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combination of HBIg and lamivudine shows a higher efficacy than either of them alone, possibly because of their different mechanism of action and resistant profile. This synergism may bring about the use of shorter courses or lower doses of HBIg (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>). Combinations of HBIg and adefovir dipivoxil have not been studied sufficiently.</P>
<P>Two meta-analyses regarding prophylaxis of recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation were published in 2008. The first one, that compared combination of HBIg and lamivudine HBIg alone (<LINK REF="REF-Loomba-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loomba 2008</LINK>), found six studies and showed risk reduction in HBV recurrence with HBIg and lamivudine compared to HBIg alone with OR of 0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.21). The ORs showing HBV-related death and all-cause mortality reduction with HBIg plus lamivudine compared to HBIg alone were 0.08 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.33) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.82), respectively. The second meta-analysis compared HBIg plus lamivudine to lamivudine alone (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2008</LINK>) and also found six studies. Statistically significant differences were observed between HBIg plus lamivudine compared to lamivudine alone in hepatitis B recurrence (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58), YMDD mutant (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.72 and hepatitis B recurrence in HBV-DNA positive patients before orthotopic liver transplantation (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.45). No significant differences were observed in patient survival, graft survival, and diseases leading to death (recurrence or hepatocellular carcinoma) between the two groups. A third meta-analysis was recently published by our group (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010</LINK>) - see discussion. These three meta-analyses were based mainly on retrospective observational studies, in which the risk of bias is high. HBIg and lamivudine were not compared 'head to head', and adefovir dipivoxil was not assessed. We have not been able to identify any systematic reviews, dealing only with randomised clinical trials on the topic.</P>

<P>Four of the six retrieved publications were randomised clinical trials and could be included in the review. The four trials are described in the 'Characteristics of included trials' table.</P>
<P>One randomised trial was a European multi-centre trial from the UK, Italy, and the Netherlands. The other three trials were performed in Spain, Korea, and Oceania.

<P>Altogether, the four trials included 136 participants (range from 24 to 61). Two trials compared lamivudine alone versus HBIg alone. Randomisation was performed one week (<LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK>) or six months (<LINK REF="STD-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Naoumov 2001</LINK>) after transplantation.

One trial compared combination treatment with lamivudine and HBIg versus lamivudine alone after one month of combination treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>). The last trial compared the combination of lamivudine plus HBIg versus a combination of lamivudine and adefovir after at least 12-month of lamivudine and HBIg combination treatment.

<P>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Naoumov 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK>) compared the same intervention, ie, lamivudine versus HBIg, but, as mentioned earlier, while the <LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK> trial compared both treatments after one week of HBIg to both groups, in the <LINK REF="STD-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Naoumov 2001</LINK> trial, a comparison was undertaken after six months of HBIg alone to both groups who had negative HBV DNA before transplantation. The longer period of treatment with HBIg and the fact that all patients were HBV DNA negative before transplantation both indicate that these patients were at lower risk of recurrence. As such, these two trials are not comparable. As the interventions were different in all four trials, no meta-analyses could be performed. In an attempt to provide evidence-based information about prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation, we analysed the data of each included trial separately. The results are given below:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK> compared lamivudine with HBIg, started one week after transplantation during which HBIg was administered to both groups. Thirty patients received lamivudine and 31 HBIg. Sixteen and 18 patients had positive HBV DNA before transplantation in the lamivudine and HBIg groups, respectively. The median follow-up period was 14.4 (0.3 to 42.2) months in the lamivudine group, and 6.2 (0.1 to 48.2) months in the HBIg group (P 0.157). Two patients (one in each group) did not receive proper administration of prophylaxis. Nineteen patients died, of which 16 patients died within two months after transplantation: six in the lamivudine group and ten in the HBIg group. There was a trend regarding the mortality in favour of lamivudine that did not reach statistical significance (6 of 30 patients died in the lamivudine group versus 13 out of 31 in the HBIg group; risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 1.09), despite the fact that follow-up was longer in the lamivudine group. None of the deaths were judged to be related to HBV. HBsAg reappeared in three patients from the lamivudine group and in one patient from the HBIg group (RR 3.10, 95% CI 0.34 to 28.17). HBV DNA reappearance, as well as HBV-related active liver disease or liver disease-related complications, were not reported. Liver biopsies, YMDD mutations, and adverse events of the drugs were not reported in this trial. In summary, no significant differences between lamivudine and HBIg after one week of combination therapy were noted in this trial of 61 patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Naoumov 2001</LINK> compared lamivudine with HBIg after at least six months of HBIg alone after transplantation. There were 24 patients (12 in each group), all of them had negative HBV DNA before transplantation and the follow-up period lasted 52 weeks from randomisation. No deaths were reported. HBsAg reappeared in two patients from the lamivudine group and in one patient from the HBIg group (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 19.23). HBV DNA was positive at least in one measurement in nine patients from the lamivudine group and seven patients from the HBIg group. No patients with active liver disease were reported in either group, but serum ALT levels of greater than 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were detected at a single visit in two patients from the lamivudine group and in one patient from the HBIg group. Liver disease-related complications, including fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, were not found in any patient 
in either group. A biopsy positive for HBsAg was found in only one patient (in which HBsAg reappeared in the serum as well). YMDD mutations occurred in four patients in the lamivudine group (all of them with negative HBsAg). Thirteen events of minor adverse events were reported in the lamivudine group and 10 in the HBIg group (some patients had more than one event). In summary, no differences between lamivudine and HBIg, after six months of combination therapy, were noted in a small trial of 24 patients and a follow-up of about four years.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>, combination therapy of HBIg and lamivudine was compared with lamivudine alone. Randomisation was performed after one month of combination treatment with HBIg and lamivudine to both groups. Twenty-nine patients participated in the trial: 14 in the lamivudine group and 15 in the combination group. All the patients were HBV DNA negative before transplantation. The follow-up period was 18 months after transplantation. There were no deaths nor reappearance of HBsAg in either of the trial groups. No active liver disease was reported in any of the trial groups either, but elevated serum ALT levels (without mentioning the exact value) were detected in two patients from the lamivudine group and in four patients from the combination group (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.48). HBV DNA reappeared in one patient from the lamivudine group and in three patients from the combination group (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.04). Liver disease-related complications, including fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, were not found in either of the compared two groups. Routine biopsies were not undertaken in the trial. YMDD mutations occurred in one patient from the lamivudine group and in two patients from the combination group (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.28). All three had detectable HBV DNA after the transplantation. No major adverse event was reported in either of the trial groups. In summary, no advantage to the combination of lamivudine and HBIg over lamivudine alone were observed in a small trial of 29 patients during a follow-up of 18 months. Treatment failure was more often observed in the combination group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Angus-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Angus 2008</LINK>
<U> </U>compared the combination of adefovir with lamivudine to the combination of intramuscular HBIg and lamivudine. Randomisation was undertaken at least 12 months after transplantation. Until randomisation the patients received lamivudine and low-dose intramuscular HBIg. The median time from transplantation to randomisation was 4.4 years in the adefovir plus lamivudine group (1.1 to 6.3 years) and 4.6 years (1.3 to 7.2) in the HBIg plus lamivudine group. Sixteen patients received adefovir plus lamivudine and 18 patients received HBIg plus lamivudine. Three and four patients had positive HBV DNA before transplantation. The mean follow-up period lasted 21.1 months (9.4 to 35.9) in the adefovir plus lamivudine group and 21.8 months (13.5 to 35.6) in the HBIg plus lamivudine group. Neither mortality nor active liver disease occurred in either of the two groups. Only one patient from the adefovir plus lamivudine group had reappearance of HBsAg after transplantation compared to none in the HBIg plus lamivudine group (RR 3.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 81.55). HBV DNA remained negative in all patients in the two groups. Liver disease-related complications, including fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, were not found in either of the two groups. Routine biopsies were not undertaken in the trial. In one patient from the adefovir plus lamivudine group (with pre-existing diabetic and hypertension nephropathy), serum creatinine rose significantly, necessitating adefovir dose reduction and withdrawal from the trial. No other severe adverse events were reported in either of the two groups. In summary, there was no advantage to HBIg and lamivudine as compared with adefovir dipivoxil and lamivudine after a median of about four years of combination therapy, in a small trial with nearly no events.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-17 06:41:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>In this systematic review we tried to evaluate the current best prophylactic treatment in order to prevent recurrent HBV infection in liver transplanted patients due to chronic hepatitis B liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, only four randomised clinical trials compared different options, and meta-analyses could not be performed because these trials assessed different interventions and comparisons. Two trials compared lamivudine with HBIg (<LINK REF="STD-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Naoumov 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK>), following different durations of HBIg treatment after transplantation. A third trial compared lamivudine alone with combination treatment of lamivudine and HBIg (<LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>). A fourth trial compared adefovir with HBIg in patients who received lamivudine in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Angus-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Angus 2008</LINK>). The primary outcome measures in our review were all-cause mortality and reappearance of HBsAg in the serum after liver transplantation. Several secondary outcome measures such as HBV-related mortality, HBV DNA reappearance, and HBV-related active liver disease were assessed as well. In each of the comparisons and outcomes no statistically significant differences were detected, but all interventions were assessed in single trials and all were underpowered to detect significant differences.</P>
<P>HBIg and antivirals prevent recurrence of hepatitis B by different mechanisms. HBIg neutralise circulating virus particles and induce lysis of infected hepatocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Yi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yi 2007</LINK>), while antivirals act directly to reduce viral load in the liver and extrahepatic sites (<LINK REF="REF-Schreibman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreibman 2006</LINK>). The decrease in viral load, caused by antivirals, may prevent the saturation of HBIg binding sites and reduce the immune pressure leading to emergence of surface antigen mutations. At the same time, lowering the number of virions by HBIg decreases the viral substrate for antivirals, thus leading to reduction in the emergence of drug resistant mutants (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yi 2007</LINK>). This has lead to a hypothesis of synergistic activity for HBIg and antivirals (<LINK REF="REF-Villamil-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villamil 2003</LINK>). Unfortunately, since the HBV genome consists of overlapping reading frames, mutations in the surface gene may cause changes in the polymerase gene, and vice versa. Therefore, the use of combination treatment may lead to selection of mutations that reduce the efficacy of each of the drugs and lead to HBV recurrence.</P>
<P>Given the absence of randomised clinical trials to answer our question, we performed a comprehensive literature search for non-randomised clinical studies, that is, observational prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case-control studies comparing treatment regimens for the prevention of HBV following liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010</LINK>). Original search terms and search results have been previously reported (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010</LINK>, see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, and paragraph 'data sources' at the method section in the mentioned reference). High risk of bias was noted in these studies (see <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010</LINK> for the detailed methodological quality assessment of these studies using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale).</P>
<P>Ten studies, most of them retrospective, compared HBIg alone to combination treatment of HBIg and antivirals.

One of these studies compared a combination of HBIg and lamivudine or adefovir to HBIg (<LINK REF="REF-Yilmaz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yilmaz 2007</LINK>), and all the other studies compared HBIg plus lamivudine to HBIg. Pooling the results showed that combination treatment with HBIg and lamivudine seemed better than HBIg alone in reducing HBV recurrence defined by reappearance of HBsAg (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.66, 10 studies, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 60.7%) and HBV DNA (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.98, two studies, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%) after transplantation, all-cause mortality (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.77, seven studies, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 6.4%), HBV-related mortality and HBV-related active liver disease. Results were homogenous (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found nine studies that compared combination treatment to antivirals alone (including the one randomised trial included in the current review) (<LINK REF="REF-Anselmo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anselmo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jiao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiff-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiff 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshida-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshida 2007</LINK>). Lamivudine was compared to combination of lamivudine or adefovir plus HBIg in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2004</LINK>); combination of lamivudine plus adefovir was compared to lamivudine plus adefovir plus HBIg in another study (<LINK REF="REF-Schiff-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiff 2007</LINK>), and in all others lamivudine was compared to lamivudine plus HBIg. HBsAg reappearance seemed significantly lower with combination therapy (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.44, nine studies, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 37.5%) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), in contrast with HBV DNA reappearance, which occurred in the same rate in both groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.84, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%, five studies). All-cause mortality, HBV-related mortality, and HBV-related active liver disease showed no significant effect of combination treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A 'head to head' comparison between lamivudine and HBIg was performed only in one retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Anselmo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anselmo 2002</LINK>), which found a similar HBsAg reappearance (13/20 versus 13/28, respectively). HBV-related mortality was 0/20 in the lamivudine group and 9/28 in the HBIg group. However, this retrospective study did not mention the duration of follow-up and HBV DNA status prior to transplantation in each group separately. The treatment protocol of the lamivudine group was not mentioned separately, and we could not understand whether these patients had also received HBIg for a defined period after transplantation as was the case in our two included trials that compared lamivudine to HBIg. Our analysis of randomised trials resembled these results, and a trend toward decreased mortality was seen in the lamivudine group when it was given after one week of HBIg (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK>). No deaths were reported in any of the lamivudine and HBIg groups when they were given after at least six months of HBIg alone (<LINK REF="STD-Naoumov-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Naoumov 2001</LINK>). The reasons for the lower mortality in both groups of the latter study might be due to either the longer period of HBIg treatment, or the study design that included only patients with negative HBV DNA before transplantation. However, we cannot explain the high mortality not associated with HBV in the study conducted by Park (<LINK REF="STD-Park-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Newer drugs with lower resistance induction have largely replaced lamivudine as first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B. These drugs, particularly entecavir, tenofovir, and to some extent telbivudine, may replace lamivudine and adefovir in the transplant setting. However, these drugs have not been compared with lamivudine with or without HBIg after liver transplantation in clinical studies, and their safety and efficacy as well as tolerability and cost should be determined in this setting.</P>

<P>This review of randomised trials provides no clear evidence for the treatment of patients following liver transplantation for chronic HBV infection in order to prevent recurrence. Non-randomised studies suggested that combination therapy using lamivudine and HBIg seems superior to monotherapy with either one of them regarding survival and HBV recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2010</LINK>). Combination treatment with nucleoside analogue and HBIg has already been established by some as the standard treatment to prevent recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Angus-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angus 2008b</LINK>). However, in the absence of a large randomised clinical trials comparing combination treatment to each of the monotherapy alone, practice will remain based on data with high risk of bias.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-18 11:34:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to this review, the practice of administration of combination treatment in order to prevent recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation is not evidence-based. It is difficult to answer the question whether randomised clinical trials comparing combination with monotherapy are warranted or ethical, given the large benefit for combination therapy observed in non-randomised studies. We believe that such trials are needed given the high risk of bias of the non-randomised studies in existence. The randomised clinical trials should have adequate sample sizes to show the superiority of combination treatment and shall be performed following the CONSORT Statement (www.consort-statement.org). The trials should compare combination treatment of HBIg and one of the newer antivirals (eg, tenofovir or entecavir) to the same antiviral alone, based on our knowledge about their lower resistance rate compared with lamivudine. The prophylaxis regimens and follow-up should be of sufficient duration in order to measure the effect on antiviral drug resistance development. Two ongoing trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. The first one, <LINK REF="STD-NCT00059267" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00059267</LINK> has been completed and is comparing treatment with HBIg, lamivudine, and adefovir. The second one, <LINK REF="STD-NCT01046799" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01046799</LINK>, a non comparative study, that aims at determining whether HBIg can be discontinued early after HBV induced liver transplantation and be replaced by entecavir to prevent reinfection is still ongoing.</P>
<P>According to the current literature (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2007</LINK>), low-dose HBIg in combination therapy seems beneficial and should, perhaps, be assessed as combination therapy instead of the high-dose, costly regimens. Since liver transplanted patients are not a homogenous group of patients, the existence of patient subgroups that might benefit from combination treatment or antiviral alone should be explored. An emphasis should be given to differentiate patients according to their HBV replication status, since higher levels of HBV DNA are a strong predictor for recurrence.</P>

<P>Differences between the protocol from 2006 and this review:</P>
<P>1. Since it has become a common practice today to give both lamivudine and HBIg, we added the option of combination treatment in the 'Types of interventions'.<BR/>2. We did not apply the exclusion criteria.<BR/>3. We moved reappearance of HBsAg and reappearance of HBV DNA from the primary outcomes to the secondary outcomes.</P>

The allocation table was separately created prior to the initiation of the trial (again, by someone not involved in the trial but in the same department) and had provision for 20 patients at each site (10 in each group).
