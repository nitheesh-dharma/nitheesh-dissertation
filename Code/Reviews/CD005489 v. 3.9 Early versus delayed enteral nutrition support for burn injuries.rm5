<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Do burns patients who receive early (within 24 hours) nutritional support have better outcomes than those whose nutritional support is delayed (after 24 hours)?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Adult patients with large burns have increased nutrition and energy requirements. If such requirements are not met, it is associated with worse health outcomes including increased infection rates and poorer healing. Patients are often not able to meet the increased requirements through oral feeding alone, thus enteral feeding is often used. Enteral nutrition is provided by inserting a feeding tube via the nose or mouth, into the stomach or small intestine. The feeding tube delivers a liquid formula (enteral nutrition) containing the required nutrients. Enteral feeding is continued until sufficient oral intake is established to meet the patient's need.</P>
<P>Enteral nutrition is essential for the successful management of the burns patient, however there is debate regarding the optimal method and timing of feeding. It is unclear whether providing enteral nutrition from an early stage after injury is preferable to delaying such support. The authors of this review attempted to resolve this uncertainty by examining all high quality trials comparing the effectiveness of initiating enteral nutrition in the early stages after injury (within 24 hours), with delayed (after 24 hours) enteral nutrition, in burns patients over the age of 16 years.</P>
<P>The authors found three studies involving 70 adult burn patients. The results of the studies provide no conclusive evidence for the benefit of early enteral nutritional support compared to delayed support, on outcomes such as length of hospital stay and mortality.</P>
<P>The trials involved a small number of participants and were limited by methodological weaknesses. There is a need for larger, high quality research into the use of early versus delayed feeding in burn patients. </P>
<P>Overall, the authors conclude that there is currently little evidence to support the use of early nutritional support, but more trials are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A burn injury increases the body's metabolic demands, and therefore nutritional requirements. Provision of an adequate supply of nutrients is believed to lower the incidence of metabolic abnormalities, thus reducing septic morbidity, improving survival rates, and decreasing hospital length of stay. Enteral nutrition support is the best feeding method for patients who are unable to achieve an adequate oral intake to maintain gastrointestinal functioning, however, its timing (i.e. early versus late) needs to be established. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of early versus late enteral nutrition support in adults with burn injury.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:18:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (Dec 2007), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to December, 2007), EMBASE (1980 to December 2007) and CINAHL (1982 to May, 2006).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-20 13:58:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials comparing early enteral nutrition support (within 24 hours of injury) versus delayed enteral support (greater than 24 hours).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors used standardised forms to independently extract the data. Each trial was assessed for internal validity with differences resolved by discussion. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of three randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. Results of the studies indicate that evidence about the benefit of early enteral nutritional support on standardised clinical outcomes such as length of hospital stay and mortality, remains inconclusive. Similarly, the question of whether early enteral feeding influenced or decreased metabolic rate as documented in part by our included studies, remains uncertain.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review has not found sufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of early versus late enteral nutrition support in adults with burn injury. The trials showed some promising results that would suggest early enteral nutrition support may blunt the hypermetabolic response to thermal injury, but this is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. Further research incorporating larger sample sizes and rigorous methodology that utilises valid and reliable outcome measures, is essential. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-15 11:19:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The type of formula and the timing of enteral nutrition support in patients with thermal injuries has long been debated. What is known is that burn injury can result in profound metabolic abnormalities, and that malnourishment is associated with increased infection risks, decreased healing rates, and altered cell function. The rapid removal of devitalized burn tissue, combined with early nutritional support, appears to significantly attenuate this auto-destructive process (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>After the thermal injury has occurred a cascade of events are set in motion. An initial "Ebb" phase occurs immediately after the thermal injury, and corresponds to a period of hypovolaemia and tissue hypoxia, poor cardiac output and increased oxygen consumption. The "Flow" phase occurs within 12 to 24 hours post initial insult as the patient is fluid resuscitated and a return of an adequate oxygen transport occurs. At this stage an increase in glucose production and free fatty acid release takes place (<LINK REF="REF-Mahan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahan 1996</LINK>). The metabolic response to burns is complex and is illustrated by an accelerated catabolism leading to a negative nitrogen balance and loss of lean body tissue (primarily skeletal muscle).</P>
<P>Patients with large burns have significant energy requirements. Basal metabolic rates can double when burns are greater than 50% total body surface area (TBSA). These patients, as well as those with inhalation injury who require mechanical ventilation, are not able to meet their requirements for macro- and micronutrients and fluids via the oral route. Under these circumstances, enteral nutrition support is indicated.</P>
<P>Enteral nutrition is provided by placing a flexible feeding tube via the nose, mouth or a formed tract (i.e. gastrostomy) into the stomach or proximal small intestine. The feeding tube delivers liquid nutritional formula (enteral nutrition), which contains macro- and micronutrients. Enteral nutrition will be provided until sufficient oral intake is established to meet the patient's requirements.</P>
<P>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) group (<LINK REF="REF-EAST-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAST 2001</LINK>) recommends that enteral nutrition should ideally begin during resuscitation in a patient with severe burns, but because delays (&gt;18 hours) result in a high risk of gastroparesis and need for intravenous nutrition, a fear of complications normally delays enteral support until after the resuscitation period has transpired (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although providing nutrition is clearly essential in the successful management of the burn injured patient, there are several conflicting findings amongst research groups regarding the optimal method and timing of enteral nutritional support. Although providing early nutritional support has a number of advantages including increased caloric intake (<LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 2002</LINK>) and improving bowl mucosal integrity (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK>), it has remained unclear whether early enteral nutritional support has any beneficial impact on a diverse field of nutritional, metabolic and biochemical outcomes and clinical indicators such as length of stay, infection rates and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK>). In addition, it has been suggested that more complications occur with early enteral support than late enteral support, including the risk of intestinal necrosis (<LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>As suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK> the result of these and other studies reveal that the clinical efficacy of early enteral nutrition and its effect on metabolic, and hormonal and biochemical markers, remains unresolved. While the provision of enteral nutritional support in patients with major burn injuries continues to be an accepted therapeutic modality, there is an urgent need to review the evidence regarding its safety and efficacy, optimal timing and formulation. </P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK>, 27 patients (19 men) between 18 and 50 years of age admitted within 24 hours burn injury with at least 20% injuries total body surface area (TBSA) were randomised to either early enteral feeding (within 24 hours) or delayed enteral feeding (between 24 hours and seven days). A commercial feeding formula was used with the rate of the infusion increased every six hours as tolerated until the goal rate was achieved. Patients were allowed oral intake as tolerated, stressing complex carbohydrates and protein-containing fluids and foods, minimizing fluids with simple sugars. All patients were treated according to practice guidelines set out by the American Burn Association protocols; fluid resuscitation, topical wound care with silver sulphadiazine cream during the first week, and active physical and occupational therapy. This trial reported on a series of clinical outcome measures such as number of infections, number of antibiotic days, length of stay and mortality and energy balance such as resting energy expenditure and basal energy expenditure.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK>, 22 patients (15 men) with burns ranging from 50% to 80% TBSA were randomised to either early enteral feeding (within 24 hours) or delayed enteral feeding (after 48 hours). A commercial feeding formula was given via a nasogastric tube or orally as early as possible in the early enteral group (70-80ml/3h in the first 24 hour post-burn, 0.75 kcal/ml, and 100-150 ml/2h in the second 24 hour post-burn, 0.75-1 kcal/ml). The delayed enteral feeding group was given an orally administered liquid diet after 48 hour post-burn.

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>) examined the effects of early enteral nutrition using biochemical markers such as plasma endotoxin and tumour necrosis factor - alpha and interleukin 8 (TNF-a, TNF-IL8) levels. However, the data from these studies could not be pooled as there were variations in the monitoring and recording of these results. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK>) examined changes in endotoxin and TNF levels and the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>) examined the content of endotoxin and TNF in plasma.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK> showed that serum endotoxin levels in the early nutritional support group were lower on post burn days four, eight and 14 than those who received late enteral nutritional support (P&lt;0.05). Similar reports of endotoxin levels being lower in those receiving early nutritional support group were also noted by <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK> in a series of different time points (i.e. one to six hours, seven to 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, three and five days).</P>
<P>Markers such as TNF-a and TNF-IL8 was seen to be significantly elevated after burn injury in both studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK>, the serum TNF-a levels in both groups were significantly higher than in normal controls (P&lt;0.001). The serum TNF-a levels in those receiving late enteral nutritional support continued to rise after burn injury and reached their highest level at 24 hours post-burn. Following a small decline at day three post-burn, the serum TNF-a levels increased gradually and reached another highest level at day five post-burn. The serum TNF-a level in those receiving early enteral nutritional support increased slower after burn injury (P&lt;0.001). In <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>, TNF-IL8 was lower in those receiving early enteral nutritional support during various time points (P &lt;0.05 to 0.01).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review summarises the best available evidence relating to safety and effectiveness of early versus delayed nutritional support in adult patients with burn injury. After an extensive search of the literature, we found three RCTs.</P>
<P>Our results highlighted the need for high level, good quality research into the safety and effectiveness of early versus delayed enteral nutritional support in adults with burn injury. There was wide variation amongst the studies in the timing of the initiation of both early and late enteral nutritional support and the type of clinical, metabolic and hormonal outcome measures used to determine effectiveness. All of the trials were prone to a number of methodological shortcomings including a lack of power to detect useful clinical differences between intervention groups. More importantly, the small sample sizes in all three studies may have precluded any definitive statement on definition, safety or frequency of adverse events. </P>
<P>The evidence regarding the benefit of early enteral nutritional support on standard clinical outcomes such as number of infections, length of hospital stay and mortality, remains inconclusive. Similarly, the question of whether early enteral feeding influenced or decreased hyper-metabolism, remains uncertain. This uncertainty is coupled with a number of previously published studies which showed little or no improvement in the reduction of burn hypermetabolism. For example, it was <LINK REF="REF-Eyer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyer 1993</LINK> who first suggested that enteral nutrition did not attenuate the hyper-metabolic response to injury and <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 2002</LINK> who reported that although early enteral feeding reduced caloric deficits, it did not show a reduction in morbidity, mortality, hyper-metabolism, hospital stay or endocrine status. More so, <LINK REF="STD-Hart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 2003</LINK> suggested that those who underwent late enteral feeding and burn wound excision had a decreased metabolic rate compared with the early feeding and excision group, but this effect was eliminated once delayed group patients were fed and underwent excision. Although there was a suggestion of fewer infections in the early group, no difference was reported between groups in regards to body mass index, length of stay or mortality. More recently with our included study by <LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK>, early enteral feeding did not reduce post-burn hyper-metabolism nor did it show any difference between groups in regards to number of infections, antibiotic and ventilator days, overall length of stay and mortality. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK> would suggest that the ambiguity surrounding this clinical phenomenon could be due to a lack of understanding surrounding the molecular mechanism of the hypermetabolic response to burn injury. It appears that approximately 60% of the increased metabolic response to burn injury is attributable to an increased protein synthesis, gluconeogenesis, urea production, and substrate cycling (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1999</LINK>). The remaining 40% may be attributable to Na+-K+- ATPase activity and proton leakage across the mitochondrial membrane. This understanding, coupled with recent data on the beneficial effect of beta-blockade (<LINK REF="REF-Herdon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herdon 2001</LINK>) and oxandrolone (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2003</LINK>) on reversing skeletal muscle catabolism would therefore suggest that the reversal of post-burn hyper-metabolism would require more than early enteral nutritional support alone (<LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Additionally, the frequency of monitoring the metabolic, hormonal and biochemical markers differed between the studies. In some studies monitoring was observed at day one, four, eight and 14 post burn injury, whilst in others monitoring was done on a weekly basis. This could have led to either early detection and possible treatment or possibly an inflated incidence in some cases leading to no treatment or insufficient time for the treatment to take effect. </P>
<P>The ambiguity surrounding the reduction in hyper-metabolism was still over-shadowed by gaps in knowledge surrounding when early nutritional support (i.e. timeliness of initiation of support) must be started to achieve benefit. Classic animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dominnioni-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dominnioni 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mochizuki-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mochizuki 1984</LINK>) revealed impressive findings such as decreases in the hyper-metabolic response to tissue injury, lower levels of circulating stress hormones (i.e. glucagons, cortisol and norepinephrine), increased gastrointestinal blood flow, and the ongoing preservation of intestinal mucosal integrity when animals were fed within two hours of burn injury. Although we hoped our systematic review would help clarify this issue in humans, optimal timing for the initiation of enteral nutrition support still represented an important, unresolved issue. The time to initiate feeding varied from within 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2001</LINK>) and up to seven days post burn injury for late enteral nutritional support (<LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK>). These variations suggest that early feeding may be difficult to achieve in burn injured patients given the transport and emergency and resuscitation measures required to stabilise a patient with a severe burn. </P>
<P>A number of complications were noted by <LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK> although these were not seen to be significant. This was in direct contrast to other studies in the literature that suggested early enteral nutrition support could lead to devastating complications such as bowel necrosis (<LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Overall, the evidence would suggest that a degree of vigilance be taken when commencing an early feeding regime, although this is tempered with authors such as <LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 2002</LINK> who believe that the provision of enteral nutrition is an important intervention that can be started within a few hours. <LINK REF="STD-Peck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peck 2004</LINK> purports if this is to be done, it should be done with the knowledge that there appears to be no obvious metabolic or clinical benefit. As a result, current wisdom would then propose that the need for ongoing future research that includes conducting large multi-centre, randomised, double-blind studies, determining precise feeding implementation times, rate of feeding progression, consistent feeding practices (i.e. polymeric versus elemental, fibre enriched, immune-enhancing) coupled with a number of key outcome measures is needed which in turn would allow for pooling of data in a meta-analysis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review suggest that early feeding may be associated with blunting the hypermetabolic response to burn injury, but the trials were small and prone to a number of methodological shortcomings. More RCTs are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This systematic review highlights the need for further high level, good quality research into the use of early versus delayed feeding burned injured patients. Suggestions for future research include precise feeding implementation times, conducting appropriately powered studies, and selecting uniform and objective outcome measures which will allow for pooling of data in a meta-analysis. </P>
