<TITLE>Surgical techniques for fixing extracapsular hip fractures in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-16 15:00:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Roughly half of all hip fractures are outside the hip joint capsule (extracapsular proximal femoral fractures). Many of these will be fixed or stabilised using metal implants which are a combination of screws, rods and plates attached to the thigh bone. Various techniques such as the selective removal of bone (osteotomy), the pressing together of bone fragments (compression), the addition of bone cement, and methods for insertion of nails such as reaming, are used during surgery. This review included 11 randomised or quasi-randomised trials. The majority of the participants were female, usually aged around 80 years. There were seven comparisons but the evidence for each of these was insufficient to draw conclusions. Thus, the review found that there was too little evidence from randomised trials to show which, if any, specific surgical techniques used during operations for extracapsular proximal femoral fractures are better.</P>

<P>Predominantly older people with trochanteric fractures were treated in the 11 included trials.</P>
<P>One trial (65 participants undergoing fixation with a fixed nail-plate) found no statistically significant differences between osteotomy versus anatomical reduction.<BR/>
<BR/>Four trials, involving 465 participants undergoing fixation with a sliding hip screw (SHS), compared osteotomy versus anatomical reduction.

<P>Two trials (138 participants) compared SHS fixation of a trochanteric hip fracture augmented with cement against a standard fixation. There were no reoperations even for the four cases of fixation failure in the cement group. The cement group had significantly better quality of life scores at six months. One trial (200 participants) comparing compression versus no compression of a trochanteric fracture in conjunction with SHS fixation found no significant differences between the two groups. One trial (120 participants) found a tendency to improved outcomes with a hydroxyapatite coated lag screw, but none reached statistical significance. One trial (19 participants) reported reduced temperatures when using a modified reaming method. Another trial (50 participants) found reduced bone marrow intravascular embolism, detected by oesophageal ultrasound, when a Gamma nail was inserted with a distal pressure venting hole in the femur.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-17 14:59:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-16 15:18:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Hip fracture is the general term for fracture of the proximal (upper) femur. These fractures can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring within or proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring outside or distal to the hip joint capsule). Extracapsular hip fractures are defined as those fractures that occur within the area of bone bounded by the attachment of the hip joint capsule and extending down to a level which is five centimetres below the distal (lower) border of the lesser trochanter. Other terms used to describe these fractures include trochanteric, subtrochanteric, pertrochanteric and intertrochanteric fractures. These terms reflect the proximity of these fractures to the greater and lesser trochanters, which are two bony protuberances (bulges) at the upper end of the femur outside the joint capsule. These fractures can be subdivided into 'stable' and 'unstable' fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1980</LINK>). Stable fractures are two part fractures, whilst unstable fractures are comminuted with more than two parts to the fractures.</P>
<P>In centres with appropriate surgical facilities, most intertrochanteric fractures are treated operatively (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2008</LINK>). The most common implant used for internal fixation of these fractures is the sliding hip screw (SHS). This implant consists of a screw which is passed up the femoral neck to the femoral head connected to a plate on the femur. The SHS is equivalent to the Compression, Dynamic, Richards or Ambi hip screws. These are considered 'dynamic' implants as they have the capacity for sliding at the plate/screw junction to allow for collapse at the fracture site.</P>
<P>Fixed nail plates consist of a nail, which is passed up the femoral neck to the femoral head, connected to a plate on the femur. These implants have no capacity for sliding to compensate for collapse at the fracture site and hence are termed 'static' or 'fixed' implants.</P>
<P>The Gamma nail is an intramedullary nail used in the treatment of extracapsular proximal femoral fractures. The implant consists of a sliding lag screw which passes through a short intramedullary nail. The nail is inserted via an entry hole in the greater trochanter and passed distally. Prior to nail insertion the femur has to be reamed to accommodate the nail, with some further reaming for the sliding lag screw.</P>
<P>Many different technical aspects of surgical fixation exist. These include surgical approach to the femur, reduction of the fracture, osteotomy of the femur, reaming of the femur, positioning of the lag screw and compression of the fracture. In addition, there is the use of substances, either inserted at the fracture site or coated on the implant, that are used to enhance the fixation of the fracture. This review update continues to examine only those aspects of surgical fixation of an extracapsular fracture that have been studied within a randomised trial. Trials comparing different implants are considered in other Cochrane reviews of extracapsular hip fractures: extramedullary fixation (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006b</LINK>), arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006a</LINK>), condylocephalic (e.g. Ender nail) nails (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1998</LINK>) and cephalocondylic (e.g. Gamma nail) nails (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Osteotomy of the femur</HEADING>
<P>Prior to fixation of a displaced extracapsular fractures it is routine practice to reduce the fracture before it is fixed. This is generally achieved using traction to the injured limb applied using a fracture table. Either an anatomical or slight over reduction (valgus reduction) is generally used. In addition to fracture reduction, for unstable fractures it has been suggested that an osteotomy around the fracture site alters the fracture configuration to a more stable pattern and thereby reduces the risk of fixation failure. Two different types of osteotomy have been described. <LINK REF="REF-Dimon-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimon 1967</LINK> described a transverse osteotomy at the level of the lesser trochanter: the femur is then displaced medially with the medial cortex of the proximal fragment inserted into the femoral shaft. This is also termed a medial displacement osteotomy. <LINK REF="REF-Sarmiento-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarmiento 1970</LINK> described a valgus osteotomy, which is an oblique osteotomy from the greater to lesser trochanter. The theoretical benefit of these osteotomies is that they will reduce the degree of collapse that occurs at the fracture site and thereby the risk of fixation failure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compression of the fracture</HEADING>
<P>Compression of the fracture site has been advocated as a method of reducing any gap at the fracture surfaces and thus reducing the time it takes for the fracture to heal and the risk of fixation failure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reaming of the femur</HEADING>
<P>Reaming of the femur prior to insertion of the lag screw during SHS fixation of proximal femoral fracture is undertaken with a power drill and triple reamer. The reamers are used to create a cavity within the medullar cavity of the bone into which the fixation device can be placed. The friction caused by this will generate heat which may damage the surrounding bone (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1984</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Calder-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 1995a</LINK> described a modification to the reaming technique where the outer cortex is drilled with the reamer set to its minimum length of 60 millimetres. The reamer is then reset as normal and the bone in the femoral neck and head reamed. This process reduces the amount of time the reamer tip is within the femoral head.</P>
<P>For an intramedullary nail, as well as reaming for the lag screw, the proximal femoral medullary cavity needs to be reamed to accommodate the nail. This is generally undertaken with power reamers. One effect of this reaming is that the bone marrow components are forced into the venous circulation. These emboli can be detected within the circulation by transoesophageal ultrasound as they pass through the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation, where many of them lodge (<LINK REF="REF-Christie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christie 1995</LINK>). The emboli may lead to the complications of fat embolism namely hypoxia, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, mental confusion and in extreme cases cardiac arrest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cement augmentation</HEADING>
<P>The fixation of the fracture with an implant may be supplemented by the addition of bone cement. This is a compound, which is injected as a liquid to the spaces around the fractures surfaces. When it sets it bonds the bone surfaces together. Different types of bone cement are used with one of the main differences being whether the cement is slowly reabsorbed by the body by ingrowth of bone or resists being absorbed. One type of absorbable cement is Norian SRS.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hydroxyapatite coating of the lag screw</HEADING>
<P>The implant or part of the implant may be coated with a substance such as hydroxyapatite. This substance encourages bone growth around the implant and thereby should enhance the fixation and perhaps reduce the risk of fixation failure. A possible adverse effect is that hydroxyapatite coating may make the implant more difficult to remove.</P>

<BR/>Three new trials were included in this update, and formed the basis of two new comparisons. Two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2005</LINK>) evaluated the use of calcium-phosphate cement for fractures fixed with the sliding hip screw (SHS).

<P>Based on our already established methods, we evaluated various aspects of methodological quality of the included trials rather than risk of bias. However, as well as presenting the results of our assessment, we highlight two key sources of bias associated with lack of blinding. These are selection bias from the failure to conceal allocation, and detection bias from the failure to blind outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Some details of the method of randomisation were given in 7 of the 11 studies. <LINK REF="STD-Moroni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moroni 2004</LINK> used numbered sealed envelopes containing the randomisation from a computer generated list. <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1994</LINK> used sealed envelopes with the type of operation being determined from a table of random numbers. <LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sernbo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sernbo 1994</LINK> used sealed envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Desjardins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Desjardins 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hubbard-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hubbard 1980</LINK> used a computer generated list. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1990</LINK> was quasi-randomised and used the patient's date of birth. No method was stated by <LINK REF="STD-Calder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1996</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Roder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roder 1995</LINK>. We considered the risk of selection bias associated with the failure to conceal allocation at randomisation was high in the only quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1990</LINK>), low in <LINK REF="STD-Moroni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moroni 2004</LINK> where an independent person opened the envelopes, and unclear in the remaining trials.</P>
<P>There was a risk of detection bias, particularly for clinician-rated outcomes, in all the included trials given that there was no assessor blinding.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Operative details</HEADING>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Desjardins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Desjardins 1993</LINK> for length of surgery are presented in the analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). In including the data from <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1990</LINK>, we have assumed that standard deviations were provided in their paper. Pooled data for length of surgery were heterogeneous with <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1990</LINK> finding no significant difference (56 versus 53 minutes) between the two groups, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Desjardins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Desjardins 1993</LINK> found a significantly increased operation time for osteotomy of 103 versus 83 minutes. Both <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1996</LINK> found similarly increased operative times for osteotomy group (respectively: 70 versus 47 minutes; 180 versus 120 minutes).</P>
<P>Pooled data for operative blood loss showed a significantly increased mean operative blood loss in the osteotomy group (mean difference (MD) 85.56 ml, 95% CI 35.52 to 135.61 ml). <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1996</LINK> reported, without statistical analysis, an increased mean blood loss for osteotomy (500 ml versus 300 ml). <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1994</LINK> found that, on average, 2.0 units of blood were transfused after osteotomy compared with 1.6 units after anatomic reduction. These findings of greater blood loss with osteotomy are consistent with the more invasive nature of the operation.</P>
<P>No study reported radiographic screening time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Fracture fixation complications</HEADING>
<P>From the limited results available, there was no significant differences in the outcome measures of cut-out, non-union (this also includes "delayed union" in <LINK REF="STD-Desjardins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Desjardins 1993</LINK>), fixation failure rate or reoperation rate (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1994</LINK> did not provide separate data by group for the 12 cases of fixation failure: in nine cases, the screw had penetrated the joint; in two cases, it had cut-out of the neck; and in one case, the plate had pulled off the femoral shaft. Out of 110 patients followed up in <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1996</LINK>, there were 12 cases of fixation failure.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Roder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roder 1995</LINK> recorded the degree of bone marrow embolisation, as measured by transoesophageal oesophageal ultrasound, during reaming and insertion of a Gamma nail with or without a femoral venting hole in 50 patients. A 4.5 millimetre vent hole was drilled in the lateral femoral cortex approximately 25 centimetres distal to the tip of the greater trochanter before opening the bone marrow cavity in 25 Gamma nail patients. The amount of embolisation was graded, in a semi-quantitative way, into four groups from none (grade 0) through to heavy (grade three). Results of observations made during operations were presented by intervention group rather than by individual patients. No patient of the 25 Gamma nail patients with a vent hole had grade three embolisation but grade two embolisation was observed during reaming for 25 out of 575 observations (4.3%). For the 25 patients treated with the Gamma nail without a vent hole, grade three embolisation was observed for 365 out of 575 observations (63.5%) and grade two embolisation in 74 out of 575 observations (12.9%).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-06 15:09:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review involves a mixed collection of studies testing various aspects of surgical fixation. It reports on the comparisons that have been evaluated in randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that we have identified so far. It can be viewed as a 'work in progress', and we will continue to assess and report on new trials that arise in this area. The relevance of some included trials to current practice can and should be questioned. An example is those trials using the fixed nail plate, which is an inferior implant to sliding hip screw (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006b</LINK>). Overall, the available evidence from these small trials, with only modest methodological quality or worse, is limited and thus only tentative conclusions can be drawn for each of the seven comparisons.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Fixed nail plate using an osteotomy (treatment group) or anatomical reduction (control group)</HEADING>
<P>Osteotomy of the proximal femur for an unstable trochanteric fracture was originally described with the use of a fixed nail plate. The theory was that collapse at the fracture site would be reduced as bone to bone contact was restored medially. This would reduce the risk of the implant penetrating through the femoral head into the joint. The one included trial comparing osteotomy with anatomical reduction for a fixed nail plate presented only limited results for a small number of patients. While none of the differences between the two groups for fracture fixation complications, mortality and mobility were statistically significant, all four cases of fixation failure occurred in the anatomical reduction group. An osteotomy may therefore be appropriate if a fixed nail plate is used to fix an unstable trochanteric fracture. As noted above, physicians should however be aware that a fixed nail plate may not be the choice of implant for this type of fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sliding hip screw (SHS) using an osteotomy (treatment group) or anatomical reduction (control group)</HEADING>
<P>The dynamic nature of the SHS, when used for trochanteric fractures, allows for collapse at the fracture site. Thus theoretically, this reduces the possible benefits of osteotomy. Osteotomy appears to have no beneficial effect on reducing the risk of implant cut-out or the overall fixation failure rate. <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1994</LINK> observed that the incidence of fixation failure within the osteotomy group was reduced when a short barrel SHS was used; they reported that they had only one failure out of 11 osteotomy cases after the short barrel plate was introduced as opposed to seven out of 34 prior to this.</P>
<P>As would be expected, the addition of osteotomy as part of the surgical procedure increased the length of surgery and operative blood loss. Few data were presented on the incidence of post-operative complications but overall there was no significant difference in complications between groups. Neither was there any significant difference for mortality or morbidity. Nor was there for measures of anatomical deformity. However, the increased tendency for leg shortening with osteotomy found in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1990</LINK> is consistent with the results from theoretical studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Bone cement augmentation at the fracture site</HEADING>
<P>The limited number of patients and incomplete recording and reporting of outcome in the two trials mean that no definite conclusions can be made. Movement at the fracture site appeared less in the cement augmented group as demonstrated by the reduced translation at the fracture site and slide of the lag screw within the barrel. The clinical significance of this difference was not demonstrated. Of concern were the two cases of delayed union and the two cases of detachment of the plate from the femur in the cement augmented group of <LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2005</LINK>. In addition, removal of the implant when cement is used may be more difficult should a reoperation be required. The favourable results for cement augmentation in terms of pain, earlier recovery of basic activities of living at six weeks, and quality of life at six months also need confirmation. In all, further good quality randomised trials with larger number of patients are required. Blinding of some outcome assessors and participants should also be possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compression of a trochanteric fracture in conjunction with a SHS</HEADING>
<P>The one study identified indicated that compression of a trochanteric fracture internally fixed with a SHS may offer no benefit and may increase the risk of varus angulation of the fracture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hydroxyapatite coating of the lag screw</HEADING>
<P>The one study identified on this topic suggested that coating the lag screw with hydroxyapatite reduced the occurrence of cut-out of the femur and improved the function at six months. However, these findings were not statistically significant and thus no definite conclusions should be drawn. Removal of the screws that are hydroxyapatite coated, should it be required subsequently, may be more difficult and this was not discussed in this study. Given that the lead investigator of this study has conducted several studies evaluating hydroxyapatite-coated screws in other fractures that show promising results also, it is important (particularly for reasons of applicability) that further trials are carried out by other investigators.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reaming of the femur for SHS fixation using a modified reaming method</HEADING>
<P>The data presented on this small study indicated that the modified reaming method reduced the temperature generated within the femoral head. However there was no measurement of clinical outcomes, even those which may be directly affected by the high temperatures within the femoral head such as non-union or avascular necrosis. Thus, the clinical relevance of this is open to question.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The provision of a distal femoral venting hole during reaming for Gamma nail fixation</HEADING>
<P>The data presented for 50 patients undergoing Gamma nail fixation indicated that vascular embolisation of bone marrow can be reduced by drilling a vent hole in the distal femoral cortex. However, as there were no measures of clinical outcome the clinical relevance of this is open to question. Furthermore, given that one of the problems of Gamma nail fixation is fracture of the femur below the implant, the vent hole would weaken the bone in this area and the extra risk of fracture would need to be assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence available to support the routine use of either osteotomy or intra-operative fracture compression when a SHS is used for the internal fixation of a trochanteric proximal femoral fracture.</P>
<P>Insufficient evidence exists to support use of bone cement augmentation, hydroxyapatite coating of the lag screw, the reaming of the femur using a modified technique for SHS fixation or the use of a vent hole in the femur for Gamma nail fixation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The evidence base from these small trials often with flawed methodology is insufficient to draw conclusions of the effects of the different techniques tested so far. Any new or modified technique should be tested in good quality randomised trials against the best standard procedure, collecting clinically relevant outcomes. Many other aspects of the surgical fixation of extracapsular fracture have not been studied within randomised trials, but it is important to establish beforehand that any proposed change in technique would have sufficient impact on clinical outcome to merit further research.</P>

<P>Many of the fixation systems for trochanteric fracture have a flat surface on the lag screw that engages with a similar surface on the barrel. This prevents the screw rotating within the barrel. The potential benefit of this 'keyed' system is a reduce risk of the proximal part of the fixation rotating and a reduce risk of the lag screw migrating medially and becoming disengaged from the barrel. In this randomised study of 40 patients with a trochanteric fracture, 20 were treated using a 'keyed' (locked) sliding hip screw and 20 with an 'unkeyed' (unlocked) sliding hip screw. There was one case of fixation failure within the keyed group and two in the unkeyed group. No significant differences in pain scores were seen between the two groups. The study, which is currently reported only in conference abstracts, is excluded due to insufficient information.</P>

<P>Traditionally a sliding hip screw is inserted after a surgical incision has been made to expose the femur. The length of this incision may vary from about four centimetres to over 20 centimetres. Minimally invasive techniques use a small incision as possible by modifying the surgical technique of using a smaller length of side plate.</P>
<P>This was reported as a 'surgeon randomised' study of 48 patients with a trochanteric fracture in which 21 patients were treated using a minimally invasive approach to insert a sliding hip screw and the remainder were treated by a conventional surgical approach. The study was excluded because the contact author (E J Harvey) did not provide any details of the actual method of randomisation aside from clarifying that he supervised the test intervention whilst the other staff continued to do a conventional technique. The choice of using 2-hole or 4-hole plate was not controlled for and there were insufficient data on the distribution of 2 hole plates and fracture types. It is possible that this trial could be included in a future update if adequate clarification on study methods and results in obtained.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>In this randomised trial of 150 people with unstable intertrochanteric fractures, 50 were treated conservatively, 50 by a medial displacement osteotomy and fixation with a McLaughlin pin and plate, and 50 with a valgus osteotomy and fixation with a Mclaughlin pin and plate. This trial is included in the Cochrane review comparing conservative versus operative treatment (Handoll 2008). However, although it meets the stated inclusion criteria of this review, this trial is excluded because it presents only limited evidence for a comparison of variants of a technique (osteotomy) performed in conjunction with an inferior implant (the fixed nail plate). It is increasingly unlikely that the results of this trial would inform current practice.</P>

<P>This study was a comparative study of 63 patients with an unstable intertrochanteric fracture treated with a sliding compression screw in conjunction with a Dimon and Hughston osteotomy. These patients were compared with 45 patients treated with anatomical reduction and a sliding compression screw. Complications in the osteotomy group were one deep infection, one cut-out and one non-union. Complications in the other group were one deep infection, varus deformity in seven cases, cut-out in three, breakage of the plate in one and plate detachment from the femur in one. The study was excluded as it was not a randomised study.</P>
