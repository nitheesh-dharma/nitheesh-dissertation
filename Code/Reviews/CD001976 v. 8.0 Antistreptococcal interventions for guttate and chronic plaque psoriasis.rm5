<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Psoriasis, a disease which produces scaly pink patches on the skin, often gets worse after a bacterial throat infection or tonsillitis. When someone with psoriasis has a throat infection, antibiotics are sometimes used in an attempt to prevent this from happening. For people with psoriasis and repeated throat infections tonsillectomy is sometimes recommended. The review found no evidence from trials that either antibiotics or tonsillectomy are helpful for people with psoriasis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive acute form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. It is closely associated with preceding streptococcal sore throat or tonsillitis. Some authorities have claimed that ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis may also be made worse by infection at distant sites. Although many dermatologists have recommended using antibiotics for guttate psoriasis in particular, it is not clear whether they influence the course of either form of psoriasis. Some dermatologists have also recommended tonsillectomy for psoriasis in patients with recurrent streptococcal sore throat.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the evidence for effectiveness of antistreptococcal interventions including antibiotics and tonsillectomy in the management of acute guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 1999), Medline (1966- September 1999), Embase (1988-September 1999), the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials (to November 1999) and the European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database (to November 1999) for terms [STREPTOCOCC* or ANTIBIOTIC* or TONSIL*] and PSORIASIS using the Cochrane Skin Group search strategy. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials of one or more antistreptococcal interventions in patients with guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently examined each retrieved trial for eligibility and quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The one eligible trial we identified compared the use of two oral antibiotic schedules in 20 psoriasis patients, predominantly of guttate type, who had evidence of beta-haemolytic streptococcal colonisation. Either rifampicin or placebo was added to the end of a standard course of antistreptococcal antibiotic (phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin). No patient in either arm of the study improved during the observation period.</P>
<P>No randomised trials of tonsillectomy for psoriasis were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although it is well known that guttate psoriasis may be precipitated by streptococcal infection, there is no firm evidence to support the use of antibiotics either in the management of established guttate psoriasis or in preventing the development of guttate psoriasis following streptococcal sore throat.</P>
<P>Although both antibiotics and tonsillectomy have frequently been advocated for patients with recurrent guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis, there is to date no good evidence that either intervention is beneficial.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 12:49:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Chronic plaque psoriasis is a condition affecting approximately 2% of the population in temperate zones of the world (e.g. Northern Europe). Typically, red patches covered with silvery scales develop in areas such as the scalp, knees and elbows. In severe cases psoriasis may involve the majority of the skin surface. The factors which trigger its onset are poorly understood but there is good evidence that streptococcal infection, particularly tonsillitis or streptococcal sore throat, may play a role in initiating, perpetuating or exacerbating the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Wardrop-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardrop 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tervaert-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tervaert 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. It is strongly associated with preceding or concurrent streptococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1992</LINK>). Typically, showers of tiny erythematous papules (red spots likened to rain-drops or guttae) erupt explosively over large areas of the skin surface one to two weeks after an episode of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (sore throat). In the early stages before the typical scale has had a chance to develop, guttate psoriasis may be mistaken for a drug eruption, especially in those patients given antibiotics for an associated streptococcal infection. The true diagnosis, which is a clinical one, soon becomes apparent as characteristic psoriatic scaling develops on the surface of the papules.</P>
<P>Guttate psoriasis may arise without any preceding psoriasis (acute guttate psoriasis) or may complicate existing, often quite limited, chronic plaque psoriasis (guttate flare of chronic psoriasis). If left untreated it may clear spontaneously after a period of months or may progress to chronic plaque psoriasis. Either form may recur although the risk of this occurring is not well defined (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 12:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The link between psoriasis and streptococcal infection is probably explained by the 'superantigen theory'. The streptococcus carries a protein called the M-protein which allows it to act as a superantigen. Superantigens are bacterial or viral products that can bypass normal immunological pathways and cause powerful stimulation of the immune system. This results in the production of T-lymphocytes (white blood cells) which have been shown to be central to the development of psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is good evidence that streptococcal infection is important in psoriasis, some dermatologists believe that a wider range of organisms may be implicated in exacerbating the disease. Skinner and colleagues have suggested that the activity of psoriasis is always the result of microbial deposition in the skin (<LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1995</LINK>). They have also suggested that infection or merely colonisation by microbial organisms as diverse as the yeasts Candida albicans and Malassezia furfur, colonic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas and Proteus species, or the bacterium implicated in duodenal ulceration, Helicobacter pylori, may also be important. They suggest that treatment with appropriate antimicrobial agents should be given and that 60% of patients will improve with such treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1998</LINK>). The studies in this review were, however, uncontrolled and it would appear that no attempt was made to quantify the response.</P>
<P>Few would support such a blanket approach to antimicrobial therapy in psoriasis but specific antistreptococcal treatment is advocated in some standard texts. Camisa, in his book on psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Camisa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camisa 1994</LINK>) states: "In general new onset guttate psoriasis related to streptococcal infection involutes rapidly within a four week period with antibiotic treatment. In patients with chronic psoriasis who develop a guttate exacerbation, empiric treatment with antibiotics is indicated". Similarly, Farber has claimed that "prevention and early treatment with appropriate antibiotics administered at the onset of upper respiratory infections in children with psoriasis may be able to block the appearance of acute guttate psoriasis" (<LINK REF="REF-Farber-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farber 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the link between streptococcal infection and psoriasis, it has been proposed that tonsillectomy can be beneficial for patients with recalcitrant psoriasis exacerbated by recurrent tonsillitis. Seventy-four patients with psoriasis who underwent tonsillectomy were investigated retrospectively by <LINK REF="REF-Nyfors-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyfors 1976</LINK>. The average period of follow-up was 4.5 years. Following tonsillectomy, clearance was achieved in one third of patients with an additional one third showing considerable improvement. <LINK REF="STD-Hone-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hone 1996</LINK> investigated 13 patients with either guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis exacerbated by tonsillitis. Psoriasis cleared completely after tonsillectomy in five of six patients with guttate psoriasis and two of seven with chronic plaque psoriasis. <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1994</LINK> reported clearing of psoriasis in nine of 14 patients (all of whom had evidence of streptococcal colonisation) following tonsillectomy. <LINK REF="STD-McMillin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McMillin 1999</LINK> found that two children with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis complicated by recurrent guttate psoriasis were completely free of psoriasis 16 months after adenotonsillectomy. <LINK REF="STD-Ozawa-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ozawa 1999</LINK> claimed that tonsillectomy was "effective" in 16.7% of a large Japanese cohort of 385 patients with generalised pustular psoriasis. The relationship between psoriasis and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis is not well understood and the latter condition is for that reason frequently termed palmoplantar pustulosis. It is however of interest that a large Japanese study has claimed a 72% cure rate for this condition following tonsillectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Tsubota-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsubota 1994</LINK>). All of these studies were uncontrolled.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-17 12:49:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The mainstays of treatment for both guttate and mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis comprise topical therapy with tar, anthralin (dithranol), vitamin D analogues or corticosteroids, often combined with phototherapy. Whether administration of anti-streptococcal antibiotics can alter the course of guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis remains uncertain. This review aimed to assess whether there is a place for antistreptococcal antibiotic therapy in psoriasis and, if so, whether subgroups of patients who may benefit can be identified.</P>
<P>This review also examined whether there is any evidence which would support the use of tonsillectomy for selected patients with psoriasis.</P>
<P>The treatment of guttate psoriasis is addressed in a companion Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is no information as to what percentage reduction in psoriasis severity score is perceived by people with psoriasis as being "worthwhile". It may be possible to achieve a modest reduction in objective psoriasis severity score which, whilst achieving statistical significance, does not have a significant impact on either the patient's or the physician's perception of overall disease severity. There is enormous variation between patients in their perceptions of what constitutes a satisfactory response to treatment. Therefore, where scores were given, a relative treatment difference of at least 50% for comparison between active treatment versus placebo, or at least 20% between two or more active treatments were accepted as being of importance in psoriasis. (These figures were derived by discussion within the Cochrane Skin Group.)</P>

<P>The one small trial which was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1992</LINK>) had, as inclusion criteria, cultural or serological evidence of beta-haemolytic streptococcal colonisation. One regimen of anti-streptococcal antibiotics (phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin plus rifampicin) was compared with another regimen (phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin plus placebo). No clinical change in psoriasis was detected in either treatment group throughout the study.</P>
<P>A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Nyfors-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nyfors 1973</LINK>) excluded any patient with evidence of streptococcal infection or colonisation. As explained above this study was excluded from the current review because the results were impossible to interpret. However, in the text the author states that oral sodium fusidate conferred no significant benefit.</P>
<P>No trials were found which compared the use of antibiotics with placebo.</P>
<P>No trials of tonsillectomy in the treatment of psoriasis were identified. The difficulties of designing a randomised controlled trial to investigate this intervention are clear. <LINK REF="STD-Hone-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hone 1996</LINK> carried out a prospective study of 13 patients with recalcitrant psoriasis exacerbated by recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy. Five of six patients with guttate psoriasis cleared completely and one was improved following tonsillectomy. Two of seven patients with plaque psoriasis were cleared, two were improved and three were unchanged following this intervention. Their conclusion was that tonsillectomy may be a successful treatment modality in selected patients with recalcitrant guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis is, however, characteristically self-limiting and no control patients were studied.</P>
<P>As previously discussed, many physicians prescribe antibiotics for the treatment of psoriasis, particularly when there is evidence of a recent streptococcal infection. Although the role of streptococcal infection in exacerbations of psoriasis is not disputed it would seem that, despite popular text book recommendations, there is no firm evidence to support the use of antistreptococcal antibiotics in these patients. Surprisingly, there has been very little published work in this area.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although it is well known that guttate psoriasis may be precipitated by streptococcal infection, there is no convincing evidence to support the use of antibiotics either in the management of established guttate psoriasis or in preventing the development of guttate psoriasis following streptococcal sore throat.</P>
<P>Although both antibiotics and tonsillectomy have frequently been advocated for patients with recurrent guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis, there is to date no good evidence that either intervention is beneficial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>While there is a good theoretical basis for advocating antibiotics for guttate psoriasis in particular, there is no firm evidence that they are beneficial in this situation. </P>
<P>There has been no satisfactory study comparing antibiotic therapy with placebo in patients with either guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis. The following studies would help to establish whether there is any place for antibiotic therapy in these patients:</P>
<P>1. Antibiotics in established guttate psoriasis: Antistreptococcal antibiotic versus placebo in patients with active guttate psoriasis (stratified into a) acute guttate psoriasis and guttate flare of preexisting chronic plaque psoriasis and b) early intervention after onset and delayed intervention after onset)</P>
<P>2. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence of guttate psoriasis: Prophylactic courses of antistreptococcal antibiotic versus placebo for symptoms of sore throat in patients following resolution of an episode of guttate psoriasis in patients with recurrent guttate psoriasis</P>
<P>3. Antibiotics in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis with evidence of recurrent streptococcal sore throat: Long-term prophylactic antistreptococcal antibiotics versus placebo</P>
<P>Whether or not there is a role for tonsillectomy in selected patients is also unclear. As some patients are currently being subjected to the painful and potentially hazardous procedure of tonsillectomy, it is important to establish whether this form of intervention is of benefit. The following study would help to address this.</P>
<P>4. Tonsillectomy for patients with recurrent severe guttate or recalcitrant chronic plaque psoriasis with evidence of recurrent streptococcal sore throat: Tonsillectomy versus no tonsillectomy (stratified into guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis)</P>
