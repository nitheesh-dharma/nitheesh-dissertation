<P>Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is most common around springtime. The symptoms are mostly sneezing, a runny nose and watery eyes. We looked for trials that compared antihistamines (either oral or topical) in addition to a topical nasal steroid with a topical nasal steroid alone in children who had allergic rhinitis. We wanted to know whether adding antihistamines (oral or topical) in the therapy of children with allergic rhinitis who already use topical nasal steroids would have additional benefits for them. We found one trial that had been carried out in children comparing oral antihistamines in addition to topical nasal steroids with topical nasal steroids alone but it did not provide sufficient data to draw any conclusions. Most of the trials focused only on adults or included a small number of children. Unfortunately, the trials which included children along with adults did not report whether there were any differences in the effect of treatment or adverse effects in children in comparison with adults. We are therefore unable to draw a conclusion as to whether or not this combination therapy has beneficial effect in children with allergic rhinitis or whether the benefits are acceptable in terms of the adverse effects.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fireman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fireman 2000</LINK>) and its prevalence has significantly increased among children over the last two decades. Prevalence and severity are related to age, with children of school age most commonly affected.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is clinically defined as a symptomatic disorder of the nasal membranes and surrounding tissues induced by an IgE mediated inflammation after the exposure of the nasal membranes to an allergen (<LINK REF="REF-ARIA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARIA 2008</LINK>). In the immediate response to an antigen (the early-phase allergic reaction) histamine and other inflammatory mediators are released from mast cells in the nasal mucosa which were previously sensitised by an antigen. This causes the characteristic nasal symptoms which include sneezing, pruritus (itching), rhinorrhoea (runny nose) and nasal congestion. A late-phase allergic reaction occurs approximately four to 12 hours after antigen exposure with nasal congestion as the predominant symptom. Children may exhibit other signs such as allergic salute (the rubbing of the hand against the nose in response to pruritus and rhinorrhoea), allergic shiner (bruised appearance on the skin under one or both eyes) and allergic crease (a wrinkle across the bridge of the nose caused by repeated allergic salute).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Classification</HEADING>
<P>Allergic rhinitis has been defined as seasonal or perennial based on the duration of exposure to the allergen. The more recent ARIA guidelines of the World Health Organization include a classification which utilises symptoms and quality of life parameters (<LINK REF="REF-ARIA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARIA 2008</LINK>). It is based on the duration of symptoms, which are either 'intermittent' (lasting for less than four days per week or for less than four weeks per year) or 'persistent' (lasting in excess of four days per week and for more than four weeks per year). The classification is further subdivided into either 'mild' or 'moderate to severe', depending on the degree of severity and the impact on quality of life.</P>
<P>The ARIA guidelines for the treatment of allergic rhinitis base their recommendations for the appropriate treatment on randomised controlled trials performed using the historical classification of rhinitis. The clinical recommendations associated with these guidelines have now been adapted to the new classification (<LINK REF="REF-ARIA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARIA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Cauwenberge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Cauwenberge 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is based on a typical history of allergic symptoms and in vivo and in vitro diagnostic tests. These may include both serological testing for IgE which is directed towards the detection of free or cell-bound IgE using enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST) or a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) in conjunction with skin-prick testing (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1997</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-06-14 12:57:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As well as being recommended concurrently with pharmacological treatment, allergen avoidance is the first-line treatment. There is, however, considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of allergen avoidance in treating allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2006</LINK>) and it is not always possible (<LINK REF="REF-Selover-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selover 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane Review suggests that while the use of bedroom-based environmental control programmes may be of some benefit in reducing rhinitis symptoms, the isolated use of house dust mite impermeable bedding is unlikely to prove effective (<LINK REF="REF-Sheikh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheikh 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacological treatments include a wide range of topical and oral decongestants, topical and oral H<SUB>1</SUB> antagonists (antihistamines), anticholinergic agents, topical sodium cromoglycate, topical and systemic corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first-line pharmacological approach will largely depend on the frequency, severity and duration of symptoms. In the early phase of the allergic reaction, when histamine and inflammatory mediators are released, antihistamines may be considered the most appropriate treatment. In the late phase corticosteroids appear to be more effective in dealing with the inflammatory response, however they include some well-documented side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spector-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2003</LINK>). Abuse of over the counter preparations may lead to long-term damage to nasal function.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-14 12:58:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical nasal steroids</HEADING>
<P>Topical nasal corticosteroids are frequently prescribed for the treatment of children with allergic rhinitis and act directly on the nasal mucosa where they can produce their optimal effect (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1999</LINK>). Dexamethasone, betamethasone, beclomethasone dipropionate, flunisolide, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, triamcinolone and mometasone furoate are the most commonly available.</P>
<P>Topical steroids are capable of almost complete inhibition of late-phase nasal symptoms, although they have a limited effect on the early phase of the allergic response in sensitised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rak 1994</LINK>). However, due to the developmental vulnerability of children, the risks and benefits of topical steroids use need to be assessed on an individual basis (<LINK REF="REF-Gelfand-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfand 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Disadvantages and side effects associated with topical corticosteroids are local irritation of the mucosa, nasal burning and sneezing after administration, possible bloody nasal discharge and septal perforations (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2004</LINK>). Some studies have shown that dexamethasone, beclomethasone and betamethasone may induce moderate adrenal suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Gazis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gazis 1999</LINK>) and growth retardation in children (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2000</LINK>). In addition some of the side effects may be indistinguishable from the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.<B> </B>Overdosage and side effects are more likely to occur with topical drops the dosage of which is more difficult to self-monitor, and these preparations should be used with extreme caution in children.</P>
<P>A Cochrane Review provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of topical nasal steroids (Beconase® and flunisolide) for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Sayyad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Sayyad 2007</LINK>). A recent evidence report from the Center for Evidence-Based Policy looking both at direct and indirect comparisons concluded that beclomethasone, fluticasone and mometasone are associated with similar reductions in rhinitis symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Selover-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selover 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical antihistamines</HEADING>
<P>Topical H<SUB>1</SUB> receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are prescribed to treat the nasal itch, sneezing and rhinorrhoea which are caused by the release of histamine and inflammatory mediators due to the allergic reaction. Currently, the most commonly available antihistamines include intranasal sprays such as azelastine and levocabastine, and oral drugs such as cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine and mizolastine.</P>
<P>Topical antihistamines are recommended by some as an alternative to oral antihistamines to alleviate the early-phase allergic symptoms. They also have a faster onset of action for both nasal and ocular symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-van-Cauwenberge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Cauwenberge 2000</LINK>). Usually, a low dose (i.e. twice-daily intranasal and once-daily oral) of antihistamines is recommended to prevent the onset of allergic symptoms.</P>
<P>Known disadvantages of the use of current non-sedating second-generation antihistamines include the side effects of mild drowsiness, fatigue, headache, nausea and dry mouth (<LINK REF="REF-Rossi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 2004</LINK>). However, they do not have the adverse sedative effects associated with first-generation antihistamines (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanez 2002</LINK>). While all antihistamines act through the same mechanism, each type has different advantages and disadvantages. A further consideration is the likelihood of better treatment compliance with once-daily dosage regimes. Despite the availability of studies evaluating the safety profile of antihistamines in adults, there is insufficient evidence on the comparative safety of antihistamines in children (<LINK REF="REF-OEPC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">OEPC 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-04-21 14:00:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although allergic rhinitis is not life-threatening, it can have a substantial socioeconomic impact and be associated with a significant reduction in quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2006</LINK>). By limiting daily activity, allergic rhinitis may have a negative impact on social behaviour and the emotional well-being of children, and may be responsible for absenteeism and inefficient performance at school. The direct economic cost can also be fairly high and this is of particular importance in under-resourced countries and economically disadvantaged populations (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review in 1998 found reliable evidence suggesting that intranasal corticosteroids are more effective in relieving sneezing and reducing total nasal symptoms than oral antihistamines (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1998</LINK>). A more recent systematic review has shown some benefit of using intranasal corticosteroids over either sedating or non-sedating antihistamines (<LINK REF="REF-Yanez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanez 2002</LINK>). Another recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2002</LINK>) assessed the efficacy of treatments for non-allergic and allergic rhinitis which included antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, immunotherapy, sedating and non-sedating antihistamines, cromolyn sodium, anticholinergic agents, leukotriene inhibitors and sympathomimetics. It did not provide explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria for the outcomes assessed and searched only one English language database. Significantly, most of the clinical trials were supported by pharmaceutical companies and the majority of included studies reported no major adverse events.</P>
<P>As mentioned above, there is currently limited evidence available on the effectiveness of topical nasal steroids used alone for children with intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Sayyad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Sayyad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selover-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selover 2008</LINK>). The findings have cost and resource implications for developing countries where low-dose intranasal corticosteroids are prescribed as the first-line treatment for mild or persistent allergic rhinitis. A number of clinical trials have studied topical corticosteroids in conjunction with antihistamines for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in children and this Cochrane Review has been conducted to evaluate the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of this method of treatment.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-22 09:03:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite our comprehensive search, we were unable to find any well-conducted randomised controlled trials with adequately reported data which investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of combination therapy of topical nasal steroids with antihistamines versus topical nasal steroids alone in children. A substantial number of the potentially eligible studies were conference abstracts which provided limited information on study design and in general did not report the age of the participants. We retrieved studies which had recruited and included adults with children but we were unable to include them in this review as the children were usually a small proportion of the total number of participants and in most cases the data were not reported separately.</P>
<P>The lack of evidence to support decisions on the clinical care of children is an important issue and needs to be addressed with well-designed clinical trials. A study in Europe observed that over half of the pharmacological interventions used in hospitalised children were off-label drugs, which is a recognised cause for concern and raises questions about both the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in children (<LINK REF="REF-Klassen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klassen 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-14 13:00:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the importance of the topic, there is a lack of evidence to address this review question. There was one quasi-randomised study comparing the use of intranasal glucocorticosteroids alone in comparison with intranasal glucocorticosteroids and antihistamines. This study did not find any additional benefit from the add-on use of antihistamines (<LINK REF="STD-Can-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Can 2006</LINK>), however flawed study design and limited data make it impossible to draw conclusions based on these results. The limited evidence on the effectiveness of antihistamine add-on therapy and the potential for more adverse events in children should be carefully taken into consideration by practitioners.</P>
<P>The evidence on the safety and effectiveness of monotherapy with topical nasal steroids in children with allergic rhinitis is also unfortunately limited and sparse. A Cochrane Review provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of topical nasal steroids (Beconase® and flunisolide) in the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Sayyad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Sayyad 2007</LINK>). The Center for Evidence Based Policy in US undertook a systematic review evaluating nasal corticosteroids and looked at direct and indirect comparisons of nasal corticosteroids with a control group in children with allergic rhinitis. This review found a positive effect for some topical nasal steroids (e.g. beclomethasone, fluticasone and mometasone) in reducing rhinitis symptoms. The latter review also concluded that topical nasal steroids are associated with adverse events, for example nasal irritation, epistaxis/blood tinged nasal secretions and headache). In addition to this there were concerns about the potential association of beclomethasone with lower growth in the height of children over 12 months compared to placebo. Only one small trial was available which evaluated the effect of topical nasal steroids in children under five years of age. Despite reports of respiratory tract infection and skin trauma in the treatment group (mometasone), no firm conclusions can be drawn at this time as to the association between treatment and effect (<LINK REF="REF-Selover-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selover 2008</LINK>). Notwithstanding the potential differences in the effectiveness of the treatment between children and adults, none of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) undertook an analysis exploring this heterogeneity. An empirical study looking at 319 RCTs in major medical journals found that the majority of RCTs frequently ignore or incorrectly analyse the potential heterogeneity in the subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Gabler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabler 2009</LINK>). Future studies including children from both sexes and different ethnic and socioeconomic groups can provide better evidence to guide clinical practice. In addition to this, trialists who include both children and adults in their trials need to consider the possibility of using statistical techniques to explore the heterogeneity of treatment effects in different age groups and preferably report the data separately.</P>
<P>We identified a number of conference abstracts which were potentially relevant to this review but these mostly lacked sufficient information to enable judgements to be made about study design and the ages of participants. This makes it difficult to judge the relevance and eligibility of these studies for inclusion in this review. Moreover, in a number of these conference abstracts the authors did not provide sufficient contact details to allow us to reach them and request further trial information. Adequate reporting of contact details can help systematic reviewers to contact trialists for detailed information about the methods and results of their trial. In future updates of this review, we will try to identify alternative ways to contact trialists of conference abstracts which are not published as full papers elsewhere. Unfortunately, only half of the randomised trials of health interventions initially represented in the form of abstracts are subsequently published as full reports. It is therefore essential that sufficient details are reported in the abstracts so that review authors can also consider these trials and assess their methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scherer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherer 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In future updates of this review we will try further to contact the authors of identified trials which included a number of children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years old) and, if possible, acquire separate data for children to allow a comparison between combination therapy and monotherapy. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining these data, we will explore the possibility of expanding the inclusion criteria of this review to include trials comparing combination therapy with placebo. If appropriate, we will carry out an indirect comparison using these trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-22 09:13:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an urgent need for well-designed randomised controlled trials (parallel, cross-over, N-of-1 trials) to address the safety and effectiveness of antihistamine add-on therapy in children with allergic rhinitis who use topical nasal steroids. The trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">http://www.consort-statement.org</A>) or the extensions of the CONSORT statement. Trials need to have an adequate sample size and follow-up period. If a cross-over design is used, the trialists should ensure that there is a sufficiently long enough wash-out period between intervention and placebo. If cross-over trials include children with seasonal allergic rhinitis, trialists should be mindful about the variations in pollen seasons as this might further complicate the interpretation of data due to environmental co-factors (<LINK REF="REF-Akerlund-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akerlund 2005</LINK>). We have also provided a research recommendation based on the EPICOT format (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>If a cross-over design is used, the trialists should ensure that there is a sufficiently long wash-out period between intervention and placebo.
