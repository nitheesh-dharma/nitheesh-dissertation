<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We attempted to find all of the published randomised controlled trials (RCT, a type of rigorous study that compares one treatment option against another) that investigated any treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in any patient group. We looked at a number of outcomes including reduction in vision, improvement of headache and quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>IIH is a condition in which there is increased pressure inside the head without any detectable cause. IIH occurs most commonly in young women who are obese. Increased pressure inside the head often results in swelling of the optic disc (the point where the optic nerve meets the eye), which is called papilloedema. This swelling in turn causes a potential threat to sight. Different management options or treatments have been suggested for treating people with IIH, such as weight loss, drugs (e.g. diuretics) and surgery (e.g. surgery to the optic nerve, brain surgery to reduce the pressure or weight loss surgery). However, there is no consensus for how IIH should best be treated.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
<BR/>We searched for all available trials up to 22 July 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We included two completed RCTs from the UK and US with a total of 211 participants and two ongoing studies. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, together with a weight loss intervention in both groups.</P>
<P>In these studies, change in the participant&#8217;s central vision was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by a logMAR chart (a chart with rows of letters). The outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs between baseline and six months in the study eye. Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales but results were inconclusive. In the study that reported adverse effects, the acetazolamide group was found to have a greater number of adverse effects compared to the placebo controls including diarrhoea, nausea, tinnitus and fatigue. One study reported that quality of life was better for the acetazolamide-treated group. Costs were not reported in either study.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>Both completed trials had issues such as high loss to follow up and in one trial the participants and trial investigators knew what treatment was being received. The evidence was therefore judged to be of low quality.</P>
<P>More higher-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in IIH.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-24 15:33:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has an estimated incidence of one to three people per 100,000 people per year, and occurs most commonly in obese, young women. IIH is associated with severe morbidity, notably due to a significant threat to sight and severe headache. Several different management options have been proposed. Conservative measures centre on weight loss. Pharmacological therapy includes use of diuretics. Refractory and sight-threatening cases demand surgical intervention, most often in the form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Other treatments include venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-15 11:26:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified two completed RCTs (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the UK and US) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. Attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. One trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias. </P>
<P>In these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logMAR acuity. In one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15). In the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group (mean difference in change in letters read was 0.01 (95% CI -1.45 to 1.46). One study reported no cases of visual loss in 21 people treated with acetalomazide compared to 2/20 cases in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.01, 3.82). </P>
<P>The prespecified outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. One trial reported that, in a subsample of 85 participants who agreed to lumbar puncture at 6 months, people in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure (MD -59.9 mmH<SUP>2</SUP>O, 95% CI -96.4, -23.4). </P>
<P>In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs MD -0.70 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.40) and by clinical grading MD -0.91 (95% CI -1.27 to -0.54) between baseline and six months in the study eye. </P>
<P>Headache was recorded as present/absent in one study at 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12,1.41, 41 participants). Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales (different ones) but results were inconclusive (MD for change in headache score measured on 10-point visual analogue scale at 12 months was 1.0 (-1.80, 3.70, 41 participants) and MD for change in headache score on a 6 point scale measured at 6 months was -0.45 (-3.5,2.6, number of participants unclear). </P>
<P>In one study, a similar proportion of people in the acetalomazide group were in remission (however, the trial authors did not state their definition of this term) at 12 months compared to the placebo group. However, the 95% CIs were wide and there is considerable uncertainty as to the effect (OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.32 to 3.90, 41 participants). </P>
<P>In one study of 185 participants, people in the acetalomazide group had an increased risk of decreased CO<SUB>2</SUB>, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paresthesia, tinnitus and vomiting compared to people in the placebo group. In general, the estimates of effect were uncertain with wide 95% CIs. Adverse effects were not reported in the other study. </P>
<P>One study reported that quality of life was better in acetazolamide-treated patients based on the visual quality of life (VFQ-25) (MD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) and the physical (MD 3.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.70) and mental (MD 3.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.55) components of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey tool at six months. Costs were not reported in either study. </P>
<P>We judged the evidence to be low certainty (GRADE) downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-15 11:21:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH. Further high-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in people with IIH.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-15 12:30:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumour cerebri, is a syndrome that exhibits the symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) but in which there is no evidence of an intracranial mass lesion on neuroimaging (<LINK REF="REF-Galgano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galgano 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of IIH in the developed world is one to three people per 100,000 people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Durcan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durcan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 1994</LINK>). IIH is most common in obese women (<LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 1993a</LINK>). Disease onset occurs at any age but most commonly between 20 and 40 years. IIH also occurs in children where incidence is equal between males and females (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of IIH is unknown. Individual case reports of IIH have been associated with many different medical conditions. For example, IIH has been associated with endocrine disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2013</LINK>), raised vitamin A and its derivatives (<LINK REF="REF-Donahue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donahue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabassi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabassi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2007</LINK>), and drugs (most notably tetracyclines) (<LINK REF="REF-Lochhead-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lochhead 2003</LINK>). In case control studies, factors associated with IIH are female, being of reproductive age, menstrual irregularity, obesity and recent weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Giuseffi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuseffi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ireland-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ireland 1990</LINK>). The most popular theory of causation is that obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow through the arachnoid villi or venous sinuses causes a rise in ICP. It has been suggested that elevated intracranial venous pressure may be a universal mechanism in cases of IIH from multiple aetiologies (<LINK REF="REF-Karahalios-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karahalios 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Sugerman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugerman 1997</LINK> suggests that raised intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity leads to increased pleural pressure and cardiac filling pressure, impeding venous return from the brain, causing elevated intracranial venous pressure and ICP. It is possible that several different mechanisms may be involved.</P>
<P>IIH is an important condition to recognise and treat because it can cause visual loss. The degree of visual loss ranges from an enlarged blind spot to permanent total blindness. Visual obscurations (episodes of transient loss of vision) are common. <LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1982</LINK> suggested that blindness occurred in 10% of patients, but 75% to 87% of all affected eyes exhibit some degree of visual loss if carefully monitored (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wall-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wall 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>IIH was first described in 1897 (<LINK REF="REF-Quincke-1896" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quincke 1896</LINK>), but the precise definition has varied. Currently, the following criteria are generally accepted as necessary for IIH diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2002</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Symptoms and signs only reflect those of generalised intracranial hypertension or papilloedema.</LI>
<LI>Elevated ICP must be documented, measured in the lateral decubitus position.</LI>
<LI>Normal CSF composition.</LI>
<LI>No evidence of hydrocephalus, mass, structural or vascular lesion on structural neuroimaging for typical patients, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography for all others.</LI>
<LI>No other cause of intracranial hypertension identified.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Most patients have papilloedema (swelling of the optic disc), but the papilloedema may be unilateral (<LINK REF="REF-Maxner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sher-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sher 1983</LINK>). Cases have been described in which there was no evidence of papilloedema (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1996</LINK>). Headache is a major cause of morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1974a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1974a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1974b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1974b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisberg-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisberg 1975</LINK>). IIH may be spontaneously self-limiting or it may continue for many years. Features identical to IIH can occur as a result of cerebral sinus thrombosis. By definition, this cerebral sinus thrombosis is not idiopathic and we will not consider it further in this Cochrane review.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-29 15:22:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Consequent to a poorly defined disease entity and an unknown aetiology, a number of varied treatments for IIH have been suggested. Reducing CSF pressure with a lumbar puncture transiently helps symptoms (particularly headache and visual obscurations). As such, repeated lumbar punctures have been advocated as a form of IIH management. Conservative strategies include weight loss (in some cases by means of weight-loss surgery) and, in children, a low-salt diet. Alongside, simple analgesics for headaches and a range of other drugs, including acetazolamide, topiramate, other diuretics, octreotide, oral glycerol, cardiac glycosides and corticosteroids, have been used. Surgical management options include CSF diversion and optic nerve sheath fenestration. Lumbo-peritoneal shunting is used most often. However, ventriculo-peritoneal, cisterno-peritoneal and cisterno-pleural shunts have also been employed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-13 16:26:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Treatments attempt to reduce ICP and have two main aims: treatment of headache and prevention of visual loss.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-29 15:24:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no consensus on how IIH should be optimally managed. Some treatment options have significant complications, are very expensive, or both. Due to the heterogeneity of presenting symptoms and signs, patients may present to neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, otolaryngological surgeons or general physicians. Each specialty has its own preferred approach to management. Very few of the currently used therapies have been subjected to critical assessment in the form of a randomised controlled trial (RCT).</P>

<P>We included RCTs of participants with a clinical diagnosis of IIH. A particular problem arises because the syndrome is often referred to as idiopathic even when it occurs in the context of a proposed aetiological factor (e.g. the administration of tetracyclines). This leads to potential confusion in the literature. Further confusion may arise because of the presence or absence of papilloedema. For the purposes of this Cochrane review, we defined three categories:</P>
<OL>
<LI>True IIH: participants with papilloedema (unilateral or bilateral) and raised CSF pressure (&gt; 250 mmH2O; <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2002</LINK>). There had to be no other abnormal neurological sign other than the presence of a sixth nerve palsy. Cerebral imaging by either computed tomography (CT) or MRI and examination of CSF constituents had to be completely normal.

Of the 550 articles, 49 referred to dural sinus thrombosis and were excluded. A total of 51 studies were identified which related to IIH. Of these, only seven were concerned with treatment; two were retrospective reviews, and none of the others had a control group (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK>, the open-label, parallel-group RCT investigated the effectiveness of treating IIH participants with acetazolamide in comparison to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK> was a multi-centre double-masked RCT comparing patients treated with acetazolamide (plus low sodium and weight reduction diet) against patients managed with low sodium and weight reduction diet alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK> initially recruited 25 participants to the acetazolamide group and 25 participants to the placebo control. <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK> recruited a total of 165 participants (86 patients in the acetazolamide group and 79 placebo control). From those recruited, 69 (80%) and 57 (72%) participants completed follow-up, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK> was conducted in six UK ophthalmology centres and <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK> in 38 centres throughout North America.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK>, all participants had a clinical diagnosis of IIH in accordance with the criteria reported in <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2002</LINK> and consistent with the type 1 participants as described in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK> section. In the acetazolamide group, participants were 29 years old on average (range: 18 to 66), and included a female:male ratio of 22:3. In the placebo group, participants were 33 years old on average (range: 18 to 63) and included a female:male ratio of 24:1.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK>, all IIH patients met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH (consistent with the criteria reported in <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2002</LINK> and consistent with the type 1 participants as described in our <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK> section) and were required to have mild visual loss with a perimetric mean deviation (PMD) between -2 dB and -7 dB. Participants were also required to be between the ages of 18 and 60, have bilateral papilloedema and elevated CSF opening pressure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Participants were treated with either acetazolamide (clinician decided dosing schedule) or placebo, and all <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK> participants were encouraged to lose weight. For <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK>, the intervention was low-sodium weight-reduction diet plus the maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide (up to 4 g/d) or matching placebo for six months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK>, outcome measures included: headache (subjective patient-reported 10-point scale); tinnitus (subjective patient-reported presence versus absence); visual acuity (measured on LogMAR chart); visual obscurations (patient reported: absent, present, or deteriorating); visual fields (measured on automated Humphrey perimetry); contrast sensitivity (measured on Pelli-Robson chart); papilloedema (absent or present); anxiety/depression (measured on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); patient rated health status (measured on EuroQoL and Short Form 36). All outcomes were measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. At 12 months, each participant was ranked according to performance on an aggregate score of outcome measures (headache, tinnitus, visual obscurations, visual acuity, optic disc appearance, visual field). The aggregate score ranged from 0 to 15 (15 being the worst possible outcome measured). In addition, clinicians were asked to describe the condition of the participant (IIH in remission, active IIH improving, active IIH but stable, or active IIH deteriorating).</P>
<P>The primary outcome for <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK> was a change in PMD from baseline to six months in eye with most severe visual loss. Secondary outcomes included PMD changes in least affected eye, papilloedema grade (Frisén scale), visual acuity, visual quality of life (VFQ-25), 6-item headache impact test (HIT-6), quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey), CSF pressure, weight, vital signs and laboratory results. Outcome measurements were reported at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months (apart from HIT-6 and quality of life, which were only at six months).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ongoing studies</HEADING>
<P>We also identified two ongoing RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. These data will be included once available. The first ongoing trial is a placebo controlled trial assessing the safety and effectiveness of a 11-&#946;hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02017444" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02017444</LINK>). The second RCT is a study comparing bariatric surgery versus a community weight loss programme in people with IIH (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02124486" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02124486</LINK>).</P>

<P>People in the acetalomazide group of <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK> had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK> people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK>, only 85 participants (55% in the acetazolamide group and 48% in the placebo group) agreed to a lumbar puncture at six months. People in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure. However, the clinical significance of this difference is unclear (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-29 13:15:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two RCTs met the inclusion criteria of our review (<LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK> detected a small benefit for the use of acetazolamide based upon an aggregate outcome score at 12 months. Alongside this, the RCT demonstrated an improvement in clinician-decided outcome at 12 months (remission/improving versus stable/deteriorating) in the treatment group compared with the control group. The data showed that there was a reduction in headache (presence versus absence), visual loss, transient visual obscuration and improvements on binocular contrast sensitivity. However, <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK> did not find evidence of reduction in papilloedema, headache severity, improvement in visual acuity and visual field outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK>, on the other hand, demonstrated an improvement in PMD at six months in the acetazolamide group compared to placebo. Alongside this, the trial demonstrated an improvement in the treatment group's papilloedema, quality of life, weight loss and CSF opening pressure compared to the placebo group. However, it did not find a benefit in visual acuity or symptomatic headache relief.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-24 15:37:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ball-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2011</LINK>, participants were excluded if the treating clinician felt there was a more appropriate therapy than acetazolamide. There is considerable risk that the group of participants included in this RCT were not representative of the IIH population but instead represent IIH patients in which the management decision seems controversial. As such, the trial authors suggest that the participants selected may have had a relatively benign disease course. The trial authors stated that the design and size of the trial was not to detect treatment effect, but rather to assist the design in future RCT. Comparatively, <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK> has a significantly more robust design. However, the trial suffered from a high (19%) withdrawal rate bringing into question the applicability of the results. It is also important to highlight that the trial only included participants with mild (-2 to -7 dB) visual loss, meaning that evidence for the use of acetazolamide in participants with moderate to severe visual loss is lacking.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-03 17:15:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There is now evidence for the use of acetazolamide in IIH patients with mild visual loss (<LINK REF="STD-Wall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2014</LINK>). The benefit demonstrated in the RCT is modest and the trial suffered from a high attrition rate. However, as indicated in the results of our GRADE assessment, further research is required for us to be confident in the estimate of effect for several outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-29 12:23:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane review continues to demonstrate the lack of well-designed RCTs of the various treatments used for treating people with IIH. Many of the treatments have significant potential complications, as well as major resource implications. Existing studies do not allow quantification of either relative or absolute benefit of any of the treatments and there is a compelling need for large RCTs that can provide this information.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-06-01 17:13:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We have updated the protocol of this review in line with current methodological expectations for Cochrane reviews. Therefore there are some differences compared with the original published protocol. However, we did not use these updated methods in this review version because only two trials met the inclusion criteria and we were unable to perform meta-analysis. We may use the updated methods in future review updates.</P>
