<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Small-incision cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy seem equivalent considering complications, but small-incision cholecystectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The classical open cholecystectomy and the minimally invasive small-incision cholecystectomy are two alternative operations for removal of the gallbladder. There seem to be no significant differences in mortality and complications between these two techniques. Hospital stay is shorter using the small-incision operation. This review shows that the small-incision and open cholecystectomy should be considered equal, apart from a shorter hospital stay using the small-incision technique. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed operations. Open cholecystectomy has been the gold standard for over 100 years. Small-incision cholecystectomy is a less frequently used alternative. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of small-incision versus open cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(6 April 2004)<I>,</I> <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 1, 2004), <I>MEDLINE </I>(1966 to January 2004), <I>EMBASE </I>(1980 to January 2004), <I>Web of Science</I> (1988 to January 2004)<I>,</I> and <I>CINAHL </I>(1982<I> </I>to January 2004) for randomised trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All published and unpublished randomised trials in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis comparing any kind of small-incision or other kind of minimal incision cholecystectomy versus any kind of open cholecystectomy. No language limitations were applied. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently performed selection of trials and data extraction. The methodological quality of the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up was evaluated to assess bias risk. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Authors were requested additional information in case of missing data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed if appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven trials randomised 571 patients. Bias risk was high in the included trials. No mortality was reported. The total complication proportions are respectively 9.9% and 9.3% in the small-incision and open group, which is not significantly different (risk difference all trials, random-effects 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.06 to 0.07). There are also no significant differences considering severe complications and bile duct injuries. However, small-incision cholecystectomy has a shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference, random-effects -2.8 days (95% CI -4.9 to -0.6)) compared to open cholecystectomy. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Small-incision and open cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent regarding risks of complications, but the latter method is associated with a significantly longer hospital stay. The quicker recovery of small-incision cholecystectomy compared with open cholecystectomy confirms the existing preference of this technique over open cholecystectomy. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:19:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Gallstones are one of the major causes of morbidity in western society. It is estimated that the incidence of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis is up to 2.17 per thousand inhabitants (<LINK REF="REF-Legorreta-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legorreta 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 1994</LINK>) with an annual performance rate of cholecystectomies of more than 500,000 in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-Consensus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Consensus 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roslyn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roslyn 1993</LINK>). Until the end of the 1980s, open cholecystectomy was the gold standard for treatment of stones in the gallbladder. As incisions for cholecystectomy were shortened resulting in 'small-incision' cholecystectomy, morbidity and complications seemed to decline and patients recovered faster. In the early 1970s small-incision cholecystectomy was introduced as a minimally invasive procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Dubois-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubois 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goco-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goco 1983</LINK>), and has been compared in trials with open cholecystectomy. Conflicting data on clinical outcome and effectiveness arose from these randomised trials.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced in 1985 (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_he-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mühe 1986</LINK>) and rapidly became the method of choice for surgical removal of the gallbladder (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Consensus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Consensus 1993</LINK>) although the evidence of superiority over small-incision and open cholecystectomy was absent. After this consensus, attention was focused on laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the primary question of the comparison of the small-incision cholecystectomy to the classical open cholecystectomy was never answered.</P>
<P>Differences in primary outcomes like mortality and complication proportions (particularly bile duct injuries) are important reasons to choose one of the operative techniques. When these primary outcomes show no significant difference, then secondary outcomes like non-severe complications, pulmonary outcomes, differences in health status related quality-of-life, hospital stay, and differences in cost-effectiveness analysis should help decide which technique is superior. </P>
<P>Up to now, despite the availability of numerous randomised trials on this topic, no systematic review or meta-analysis of randomised trials has been conducted comparing small-incision and open cholecystectomy. This lack of evidence was the main reason for writing this systematic review. The objective was to evaluate the assumed superiority of the small-incision cholecystectomy. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of two different types of cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. To assess whether small-incision and open cholecystectomy are different in terms of primary (mortality, complications, and relief of symptoms) and secondary outcomes (conversions to open cholecystectomy, operative time, hospital stay, and convalescence). If data were present, differences in other secondary outcomes like analgesic use, postoperative pain, pulmonary function, and costs were compared as well. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:43:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised clinical trials comparing small-incision or other kinds of minimal-incision open cholecystectomy to any kind of classical open cholecystectomy. Trials were included irrespectively of blinding, number of patients randomised, and language of the article. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with one or more stones in the gallbladder confirmed by ultrasonography or other imaging technique and symptoms attributable to them, scheduled for cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis is a disease with different operative results including the number of complications and conversions. Cholecystectomy in patients suffering from acute cholecystitis should be distinguished from cholecystectomy in patients suffering from symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Therefore, randomised trials only including patients with acute cholecystitis were excluded from this review. Randomised trials including both symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis were included in the review only if the large majority (more than half) of the included patients were operated on because of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any kind of small-incision cholecystectomy was assessed versus any kind of open cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>The following classifications of the surgical procedures (based on intention-to-treat) were used:<BR/>Only if the words 'small-incision', 'minimal access', 'minilaparotomy', or similar as intended terms were mentioned in the primary classification of the procedure, the surgical intervention was classified as a 'small-incision' cholecystectomy (ie, length of incision of less than 8 cm). The length of incision up to 8 cm was chosen arbitrary as in literature most authors used this as a cut-off point between small-incision and (conversion to) open cholecystectomy. </P>
<P>In all other cases the surgical intervention was classified as 'open cholecystectomy'; this traditional procedure can be carried out through a larger subcostal or transverse incision or a median laparotomy. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measures are mortality, complication proportions (intra-operative, severe, bile duct injuries, and total complications; except minor complications), and relief of symptoms (pain relief). Although relief of symptoms is the aim of cholecystectomy, some patients continue to suffer from their complaints and have persistent pain. Most important in obtaining a high proportion of patients with relief of symptoms is adequate decision making in setting the indication to operate or not. However, it cannot be ruled out that some of this persistent pain should be attributed to the way of incision for cholecystectomy. Therefore it is of interest to include pain relief as a primary outcome.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures are all other outcomes assessed in comparing the two operative techniques. We assessed the following secondary outcomes: operative time, hospital stay, convalescence, analgesic use, postoperative pain (visual analogue scale), pulmonary outcome (pulmonary function tests by flow-volume curves), and cost-effectiveness if data were available.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:34:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases: <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(6 April 2004)<I>, </I>the<I> Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), </I>the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, </I>all in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2004), <I>The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE)</I> (1966 to January 2004), <I>The Intelligent Gateway to Biomedical &amp; Pharmacological Information (EMBASE)</I> (1980 to January 2004), <I>ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science)</I> (1988 to January 2004), and <I>CINAHL </I>(1982 to January 2004). The search strategies used are provided in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Our aim was to perform a maximal sensitive search in order to conduct a more complete review. As describing an operation of the gallbladder in medical terms without the word cholecystectomy is impossible, a maximal sensitive search with the term cholecystectomy was used. For our <I>MEDLINE</I> search, a more sophisticated strategy, advised by the Dutch Cochrane Centre and listed in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> was used (with help from Geert van der Heijden, Julius Center, Utrecht).</P>
<P>Additional relevant trials were looked for by cross reference checking of identified randomised trials. Finally all authors of included trials were requested by letter for additional information on any published, unpublished, or ongoing trials.</P>
<P>Furthermore, during data extraction it turned out that in a large number of trials essential data and information on methods were missing. To improve the quality of the analysis, individual trialists were contacted and asked for missing data.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:43:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The review was conducted according to the present protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2004</LINK>) and the recommendations by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). All identified trials were listed in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table and an evaluation whether the trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria was made. Excluded trials and the reasons for exclusion were listed as well (table with 'Characteristics of excluded studies').</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality </B>
<BR/>Inadequate methodological quality in randomised clinical trials carries the risk of overestimating intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Methodological quality, study design, and reporting quality have been recognised as criteria which can restrict bias in the comparisons of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Therefore the methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials was assessed using the following components.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice was considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. These studies are known as quasi-randomised and were excluded from the present review.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, or sealed envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described (at least) as blind to participants or assessors and the method of blinding was described. We are well aware that it is very difficult to properly blind trials comparing surgical treatments.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as (double) blind, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not blinded.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow-up<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Extraction of data</B>
<BR/>Inclusion and exclusion criteria used in each trial.</P>
<P>The following data on the randomisation procedure have been extracted:<BR/>1. Number of randomised patients.<BR/>2. Number of patients not randomised and reasons for non-randomisation.<BR/>3. Exclusion after randomisation.<BR/>4. Drop-outs.<BR/>5. 'Intention-to-treat' analysis.</P>
<P>Also information on sample size, single- or multicentre study design, assessment of primary and secondary outcome measures, use of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical experience, and intra-operative cholangiography was registered (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>General descriptive data (like sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) classification) are supposed to be equally divided due to randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Assmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assmann 2000</LINK>). These data are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> as far as available. Outcome data on mortality, complications, health-related quality-of-life, pulmonary function, pain, duration of operation, hospital stay, and convalescence were extracted according to availability.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis<BR/>
</B>With adequate binary data available, a priori presentation in odds ratios was preferred, based on clinical considerations and statistical robustness of the odds ratio. From this, results could be presented in relative risk (ratio) (RR(R)) or numbers needed to treat (NNT) by recalculation. However, exploring the data showed that for many binary data the outcome was rare or zero in both arms. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) are not estimable in trials with zero events in both arms (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2004</LINK>). Binary outcomes with zero events in both arms can merely be presented in risk differences (RD). Although risk differences are statistically less robust and result in conservative estimates, they are simple measures, easy to understand, and useful for public communication.</P>
<P>For continuous data, authors generally present their results in medians with ranges due to suspicion of skewed data. However, for the analysis of data in a meta-analysis, means with their corresponding standard deviations (SD) are needed to calculate mean differences (MD) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Using means from all trials would ignore a non-Gaussian distribution. Therefore, skewness ratios (mean divided by the standard deviation) were calculated first (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, page 96). With a ratio larger than two, skewness is ruled out, whereas skewness is suggested when the ratio is between one and two and a ratio less than one indicates strong evidence of skewness. In situations where skewness could be ruled out, assumptions on equality of median to mean was made and used in the sensitivity analyses. For trials presenting confidence intervals or standard error of means, we performed a recalculation to a standard deviation (SD) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, page 90-91). In case no data on standard deviation was available, we calculated an average standard deviation from those observed in other studies and imputed this value for the standard deviation in the sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, page 92).</P>
<P>Results were considered according to the four different criteria of quality. The existence of an overall difference in outcome was clear when all four criteria showed significance. However, when the different quality criteria showed contradicting results, then an overall conclusion considering one outcome was not obvious and had to be made individually. In each individual component, results from high-quality trials subgroups were given more weight compared to analyses including all trials or low-quality trials subgroups. Results with confidence intervals that touched, but did not cross, the line of equivalence were considered not significant.<BR/>
<BR/>Apart from comparisons in the four individual quality criteria, we also performed a comparison with trials divided into low-bias risk trials (high methodological quality) and high-bias risk trials (low methodological quality). Only trials that were assessed as adequate regarding all the four methodological criteria were considered low-bias risk trials. All trials that were not assessed as adequate with regard to all the four methodological criteria were considered high-bias risk trials.</P>

<B>
<I>Bias detection</I>
</B>
<BR/>We have used funnel plots to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates were associated with study size. The presence of publication bias and other biases (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) varies with the magnitude of the treatment effect, the distribution of study size, and whether a one- or two-tailed test is used (<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) for pooling effect estimates were explored.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In case of no discrepancy (and no heterogeneity) the fixed-effect models were presented.</LI>
<LI>In case of discrepancy between the two models (ie, one giving a significant intervention effect and the other no significant intervention effect) both results were reported. Discrepancy will only occur when substantial heterogeneity is present.</LI>
<LI>Most weight was put on the results of the fixed-effect model if the meta-analysis included one or more large trials, provided that they had adequate methodology. (By large trials we refer to those that outnumber the rest of the included trials in terms of numbers of outcomes and participants (ie, more than half of all included events and participants)).</LI>
<LI>Otherwise, most weight was put on the results of the random-effects model as it incorporated heterogeneity. The reason for this was that the random-effects model increases the weight of small trials. Small trials however are more often than large trials conducted with unclear or inadequate methods (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>In situations of excessive heterogeneity we refrained from reporting a pooled estimate when inappropriate.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The main focus of looking at heterogeneity in meta-analysis is to discriminate true effect modifiers from other sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was calculated by the Cochrane Q test and quantified by measuring I<SUP>2 </SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). If excessive heterogeneity occurred, data were re-checked first and then adjusted. Extreme outliers were excluded (and tested in sensitivity analyses) when adequate reasons were available. If excessive heterogeneity still remained, depending on the specific research question, alternative methods were considered: subgroup analysis and meta-regression if appropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Subgroup analysis<BR/>
</I>
</B>Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the effects of the interventions according to the methodological quality of the trials (adequate compared to unclear/inadequate). Furthermore, causes of heterogeneity (defined as the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi-squared test with significance set at P-value &lt; 0.10 and measured by the quantities of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>)) were explored by comparing different groups of trials stratified to level of experience of the surgeon and other factors that may explain heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Sensitivity analyses were performed imputing medians and using average standard deviations for missing data. In case of outliers and borderline trials sensitivity analyses were performed as well. Subgroup analyses were performed testing the influence of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical experience and intra-operative cholangiography on operative time, complications and hospital stay. These subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed as far as data were available.</P>
<P>The statistical package (RevMan Analyses) was used (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). The statistical analyses were performed by FK and CL.</P>

<B>Searches and trial identification</B>
<BR/>For the search strategies used and the number of hits we refer to <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The search was conducted in <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (840 hits, 65 selected) and <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2004 with the following results: the<I> Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews </I>(33 hits, none were selected), the <I>Database of Abstracts of Reviews on Effects</I> (<I>DARE</I>) (17 hits, 5 selected), the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> <I>(CENTRAL)</I> (1343 hits, 146 selected), the <I>Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (</I>11 hits, 4 selected), and the<I> NHS Economic Evaluation Database (</I>43 hits, 6 selected).</P>
<P>The search further comprised the following databases: The National Library of Medicine (<I>MEDLINE</I>) (8354 hits, 347 selected), The Intelligent Gateway to Biomedical &amp; Pharmacological Information (<I>EMBASE</I>) (685 hits, 131 selected), ISI Web of Knowledge <I>(Web of Science)</I> (1163 hits, 148 selected), and <I>CINAHL </I>(740 hits, 9 selected).</P>
<P>Altogether, the search resulted in 13229 hits. The first selection process was performed based on the title of the publications. In each step of selection, we included the publication in case of any doubt. The total number of selections by title from this group of 13229 publications was 911 hits. After correction for duplicates, 586 remained.</P>
<P>The abstracts of these 586 publications were reviewed independently by two reviewers (FK and JJ) in order to evaluate whether the study should be included in the review. Differences between FK and JJ were discussed with CL. A total of 428 publications could be rejected based on their abstract. Initially, trials which did not clearly mention whether they were randomised clinical trials or not, were given the benefit of the doubt. If appropriate, they were excluded later on. Eventually, 158 publications were selected for further evaluation and these are all listed in this review with reasons for in- or exclusion.</P>
<P>A total of 150 publications were excluded (see table with 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). A total of eight publications describing seven trials including 571 patients were included (see table with 'Characteristics of included studies' and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Critical appraisal and data extraction of these seven trials were done by FK, JJ, and CL, separately. Any disagreements were solved in several consensus meetings.</P>
<P>As no language restrictions were used, one publication (<LINK REF="STD-Coelho-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Coelho 1992a</LINK>) was translated. Double publications of the trial results by the same research group are listed in the references of included studies, and are considered as one trial (eg, <LINK REF="STD-Wani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wani 2002</LINK>). After contacting individual trialists, no additional data or information were obtained.</P>
<P>
<B>Patient characteristics</B>
<BR/>All included trials used similar inclusion criteria, ie, patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis who were scheduled for elective cholecystectomy. The extensiveness in which exclusion criteria were described varied among the trials, but nearly all trials excluded acute cholecystitis. Trials with exclusively acute cholecystitis as inclusion criterion for cholecystectomy were excluded. Trials that included minorities of patients with acute cholecystitis next to patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis were included.</P>
<P>
<B>Trial designs<BR/>
</B>Only one trial used a three-arm design (<LINK REF="STD-Coelho-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coelho 1993</LINK>). All other trials used a two-arm parallel-group design.</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical interventions<BR/>
</B>Some trials using the small-incision technique did not mention the size of the incision. We classified these trials as a small-incision cholecystectomy and not an open cholecystectomy, based on how the author labelled the operation procedure. Two trials performed small-incision cholecystectomy by a 5 cm midline incision, the others by a transverse incision in the right hypochondrium, some with muscle splitting, others by transsection of the rectus or oblique muscles. Open cholecystectomy was normally performed by a subcostal or transverse incision, sometimes by midline laparotomy.</P>
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis administered at induction of anaesthesia was explicitly mentioned in some trials. In others the explicit omission of antibiotic prophylaxis was mentioned, but most trials did not report on its use. Information on surgical experience (one or a few highly experienced surgeons performing all operations or also involving registrars) and intra-operative cholangiography (attempted in all or only in selected patients) was recorded as well.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures<BR/>
</B>A problem considering relief of symptoms and pain is how this outcome is defined and measured. Apart from differences in measurement, very few trials reported on this outcome. Therefore, we were unable to report results considering relief of symptoms and pain. Nearly all trials reported on complications, operative time, and hospital stay. Trials did not clearly mention mortality. Because of the wide range of the types of complications described, we classified (subcategorised) all complications into four subcategories (intra-operative, minor, severe, or bile duct injury) in addition to a total complication proportion (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Each complication was classified twice: once in one of the four subcategories (intra-operative, minor, severe, or bile duct injury) and once again in the total complication proportion. Consequently, all bile duct complications were registered separately from all other complications (and not counted in the severe and minor subcategories). Likewise, all intra-operative complications (except from the bile duct injuries) were categorised separately from other minor and severe complications.</P>
<P>Pain scores and analgesic use as well as health-related quality of life were frequently examined outcomes, but due to the great variation in the way these were measured and reported, it appeared impossible to pool results. Considering pulmonary function there is some limited data available from randomised trials. However, considering the inconsistency in the type of effect measure reported, as well as the difference in moments in time the outcome was measured, and the statistical problems that arise in pooling these results, we decided to refrain from reporting these results.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:19:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We evaluated the internal validity of the trials by considering the four quality components, resulting in the following number of high-quality (ie, adequate) trials. Information that was not mentioned in a trial was scored 'unclear'. When necessary information about randomisation, blinding procedure, or follow-up was unclear or missing, the authors were contacted to obtain specific additional information on these issues. Trials of which no response was received, remained classified as 'unclear' trials.</P>
<P>Of the seven included trials we assessed the quality as adequate as follows: generation of allocation sequence one trial (14.3%), allocation concealment two trials (28.6%), blinding no trials (0%), and follow-up one trial (14.3%) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A comparison dividing trials into low-bias risk trials (adequate methodological quality in all four criteria) versus high-bias risk trials could not be performed as there was no low-bias risk trial present.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 14:19:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We conducted five analyses: four comparisons based on the four methodological quality components including the subgroups high- and low-quality trials, and a fifth comparison containing sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Background data of all trials on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) classification are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> as far as data were available.</P>
<P>We identified a total of seven randomised trials comparing small-incision versus open cholecystectomy. A total of 292 and 279 patients were included in the small-incision and open groups, respectively. Data were presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> together with data on antibiotic prophylaxis, performance of cholangiography, and experience of the surgeon.</P>
<P>In the analyses, there were no significant differences in mortality, intra-operative complications, severe complications, bile duct injuries, and operative time considering all trials, neither in the subgroups high-quality and low-quality trials, nor between the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. As 'concealment of allocation' is regarded as the most important component of methodological quality, all subgroup results considering this aspect (except for the fore-mentioned results that were not significantly different) were presented in additional <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed imputing medians and standard deviations for missing data (operative time and hospital stay) and omitting one outlier in total complications. Other subgroup and sensitivity analyses were considered inappropriate as data were missing.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Mortality</I>
</B>
<BR/>Mortality was not explicitly mentioned in all seven trials, therefore there were no results for calculating a pooled estimate.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Intra-operative complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>In all seven trials complications were explicitly reported, of which zero intra-operative complications. Consequently, there was no significant difference between the small-incision and open technique.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Minor complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>The minor complication proportions were 8.6% and 6.8% in the small-incision and open groups, respectively. In analysis of all trials there was no significant difference in minor complications (risk difference all trials 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05). As heterogeneity was present, the random-effects method has been applied. In the high-quality subgroup in the 'concealment of allocation' comparison only (including two trials) a significant difference is present. In the other subgroups there were no significant differences.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Severe complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>The severe complication proportions were 1.4% and 2.5% in the small-incision and open group, respectively. There were no significant differences between the small-incision and open technique in all four methodological comparisons in all subgroups. As there was no heterogeneity, the fixed-effect method has been used (risk difference all trials -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Bile duct injury</I>
</B>
<BR/>In all seven trials no bile duct injuries were reported. Consequently, there was no significant difference between the small-incision and open technique.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Total complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>In a funnel plot using total complication proportions we did not find indication of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The total complication proportions were 9.9% and 9.3% in the small-incision and open group, respectively (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Reoperation proportions are 0.7% and 0% respectively. We have found no significant difference in analysis of all trials (risk difference all trials, random-effects 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.07). Only in the high-quality trials subgroups in the 'allocation concealment' and 'follow-up' comparisons, applying the random-effects model, a significant difference favouring the open group has been found (caused by one trial only). Performing a sensitivity analysis (15-3) by omitting the outlier (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 1997a</LINK>) led to a reduction of heterogeneity (22%) and showed no significant difference (risk difference, fixed-effect -0.04, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.01).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Operative time</I>
</B>
<BR/>There were no significant differences between the small-incision and open technique in all four methodological comparisons considering operative time. As only little heterogeneity was present, the fixed-effect method was presented (WMD all trials, 1.94 minutes, 95% CI -1.37 to 5.25).</P>
<P>All available data were shown in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. In a sensitivity analysis (15-1) including the assumptions on standard deviations and medians considering skewness, there was no significant difference. As heterogeneity was present, the random-effects method was used (WMD -2.98 minutes, 95% CI -7.86 to 1.90).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Hospital stay</I>
</B>
<BR/>There was a significantly shorter hospital stay favouring the small-incision technique. As severe heterogeneity was present, the random-effects method was presented (WMD all trials, random-effects -2.78 days, 95% CI -4.94 to -0.62). However, this concerns the data of only two trials.</P>
<P>All available data were presented in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.<B> </B>In a sensitivity analysis (15-2) including the assumptions on standard deviations and medians considering skewness, there was a significant shorter hospital stay in the small-incision group (WMD, random-effects -1.97 days, 95% CI -2.56 to -1.39).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:43:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The present systematic review contains three major findings. First, the comparison of the clinical outcome of small-incision cholecystectomy with open cholecystectomy has been conducted in seven randomised clinical trials, including only 571 patients, and no trial could be classified as low-bias risk trial (adequate in all four methodological criteria). Secondly, the total numbers of patients with complications were not significantly different for the two procedures. Thirdly, hospital stay was shorter for small-incision cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>Considering the bias risks as well as the limited data on outcomes in the included trials, there are several questions that remain unanswered like pulmonary consequences after surgery, cost aspects, and more detailed questions on convalescence. High-quality trials are more likely to estimate the 'true' effects of the interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>). Remembering this linkage between unclear / inadequate methodological quality to significant overestimation of beneficial effects and underreporting of adverse effects, the question is whether improvement in methodological quality of randomised trials will alter results.</P>
<P>No trial reported on mortality. There was no significant difference in complication proportions. All trials reported on total complications: 9.9% (small-incision cholecystectomy) and 9.3% (open cholecystectomy). Intra-operative, severe, and bile duct injury complications were not significantly different applying both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models. However, in subgroup analyses on 'allocation concealment' and 'follow-up' as methodological quality aspect, total complications differed in the high-quality group in favour of the open cholecystectomy group, both in the fixed-effect and the random-effects models. Both results are based on the outcome of one trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 1997a</LINK>). In the other two methodological quality components, however, there were no significant differences in the subgroups. Therefore, total complications cannot be regarded as significantly different for the small-incision group compared to the open group. In a sensitivity analysis the outlying trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 1997a</LINK>) was omitted from the pooled results, which did not result in a significantly different outcome. The methodological quality of the seven randomised trials comparing small-incision to open cholecystectomy was rather disappointing. Therefore total complication proportions (9.9% and 9.3%) must be interpreted with care. No clear indication of publication bias were found analysing total complication proportions (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in operative time. In all subgroup comparisons, no significant differences in operating time were found (fixed-effect and random-effects models). However, only three trials could be included in the analysis due to missing data. In the sensitivity analysis on operative time, with assumptions on values for missing standard deviations and means and checking for skewness (additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) again no significant difference was found. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the small-incision group in all four subgroup analyses after incorporating the severe heterogeneity in the random-effects model. In sensitivity analysis on hospital stay, using assumptions on values for missing data, and checking for skewness (additional <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>), small-incision cholecystectomy had a shorter hospital stay. No data on convalescence were available.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We were unable to demonstrate significant differences between small-incision versus open cholecystectomy regarding primary outcomes. We observed a significantly shorter duration of hospital stay in patients being treated by small-incision cholecystectomy. Rationally, if expertise for the small-incision approach is available, the small-incision technique is preferable for these patients. Moreover, an intra-operative conversion to open cholecystectomy remains possible without restrictions.</P>
<P>We recommend that every surgical department is able to offer this kind of elective surgery for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials on implementation issues of minimally invasive open and laparoscopic techniques in general will dominate surgical research. Randomised comparisons should be made of both minimally invasive techniques as well as traditional open techniques, both regarding clinical and oncological outcome measures as well as cost differences.</P>
<P>In accordance with research in general, the overall quality of the randomised trials included in this systematic review varied, with the majority of trials having several methodological deficiencies. In line with conclusions from other systematic reviews, the quality of included trials needs to improve in order to limit bias. Reports can be improved importantly by adopting the CONSORT Statement while conducting and reporting trials (www.consort-statement.org).</P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>The protocol for this systematic review was first published in Issue 3, 1997 of The Cochrane Library. The reviewers, Dr T Jørgensen and H Laugesen have abandoned the preparation of the systematic review. This necessitated that an update of the protocol and preparation of the review be performed by a new team of reviewers. They are F Keus, JAF de Jong, HG Gooszen, and CJHM van Laarhoven. Due to the large number of identified trials it was considered wiser in terms of clarity and usability to produce three separate reviews. Thus this review is one of the three.</P>
