<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fatigue, or tiredness, is recognised as a side effect of cancer and its treatment. In the past people with cancer were encouraged to rest if they felt fatigued. It is important that individuals with cancer receive appropriate support and advice to help them cope with any side effects of the treatment or disease. Physical exercise has been suggested as helpful in reducing the fatigue that is associated with cancer. A number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of exercise both during and after treatment. The current review was carried out to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on fatigue related to cancer. Fifty-six studies, involving a total of 4068 participants, were included in this review. Results suggest that physical exercise such as aerobic walking and aerobic cycling can help to reduce fatigue both during and after treatment for cancer. The benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed specifically for people with breast cancer and prostate cancer.</P>

<P>Cancer-related fatigue is recognised as an important symptom associated with cancer and its treatment. A number of studies have investigated the effects of physical activity in reducing cancer-related fatigue. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(2008, Issue 1). The original review identified some benefits of physical activity on fatigue in cancer both during and after adjuvant treatment.

A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. In relation to diagnosis, we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast and prostate cancer but not for those with haematological malignancies. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance.<I>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a review previously published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2008, Issue 1) on exercise for the management of cancer-related fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Cramp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramp 2008</LINK>). As a result of improved therapy, people with cancer are surviving longer and having to deal with the long-term consequences of the disease and its therapy. Consequently there has been an increasing number of individuals who need supportive care to enhance their quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lucia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucia 2003</LINK>). This has led to an increasing recognition of the symptoms associated with cancer and cancer management with relief of these symptoms emerging as an important dimension of cancer patient care.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer-related fatigue is an abstract, multidimensional subjective experience, affecting 70% to 100% of the cancer patient population (<LINK REF="REF-Mock-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mock 2001b</LINK>). It has a profound effect on the whole person, physically, emotionally and mentally (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlberg 2003</LINK>), and can persist for months or even years following completion of treatment. It can have a phenomenal impact on a patient's life, interfering with daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Curt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curt 2000</LINK>) and may also potentially have devastating social and economic consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Fletchner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletchner 2002</LINK>). It can hinder a patient's chance of remission or even cure, owing to the effect it can have on the desire to continue with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In spite of the prevalence and impact of cancer-related fatigue there are limited data available with regards to the precise aetiology, pattern over time and exacerbating and relieving factors (<LINK REF="REF-Fletchner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletchner 2002</LINK>), thus complicating the development of effective management interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Dimeo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimeo 2002</LINK>). The aetiology of cancer-related fatigue remains to be fully established and a number of causes have been suggested, such as the effect of tumour and cancer treatment, comorbid medical conditions including anaemia, hypothyroidism, cytokines and sleep problems, psychological factors such as anxiety and depression, and loss of functional status (<LINK REF="REF-Lucia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mustian-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustian 2007</LINK>). The cause of cancer-related fatigue may also differ between individuals as well as according to the phase of the disease and the type of treatment received (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2012</LINK>) has developed guidelines for the management of cancer-related fatigue. Initially any treatable factors that may cause fatigue should be identified and treated. The panel identified several factors that are treatable namely: pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, anaemia, nutrition, activity level, medication side effects, alcohol/substance abuse and comorbidities. If the patient does not have any treatable contributing factors or cancer-related fatigue persists, then additional treatment is recommended depending on the patient's clinical status. This incorporates education and counselling, general strategies for the management of fatigue, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In line with these guidelines the role of non-pharmacological interventions in the management of cancer-related fatigue is supported by <LINK REF="REF-Mustian-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustian 2007</LINK> and colleagues who have identified psychosocial therapies, physical exercise and a range of other interventions as potentially beneficial. Activity enhancement is also recommended by the NCCN as one of the non-pharmacological interventions at all stages of the disease process: during active treatment, in disease-free patients on long-term follow-up and at the end of life (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physical dimension of cancer-related fatigue is likely to have an organic aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Dimeo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimeo 2001</LINK>). The effect of treatment and a reduction in physical activity can lead to a reduction in physical performance (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2012</LINK>). Thus, the patient requires an increased effort to accomplish normal everyday activities, which leads to the perception of fatigue. This is further exacerbated by impairment of skeletal muscle function intensified by a lack of activity (<LINK REF="REF-Lucia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucia 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Exercise has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing fatigue and improving the exercise tolerance of healthy individuals as well as those with long-term conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Mock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mock 2005</LINK>). It has been suggested that changes brought about by physical activity may counteract the negative effects the tumour and toxic therapy have on the capacity for physical performance (<LINK REF="REF-Dimeo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimeo 2002</LINK>). Activity could reduce cancer-related fatigue by improving functional capacity, resulting in a reduced effort and improvement in the perception of fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2012</LINK>). Rest, the preferred recommendation for cancer-related fatigue in the past, is likely to be counterproductive as inactivity leads to muscle wasting and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness, leading to increased fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Dimeo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimeo 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Winningham-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winningham 1992</LINK> developed a theoretical framework for cancer-related fatigue (Winningham's Psychobiological-Entropy model) which proposes that a balance between rest and activity can reduce fatigue, whereas an imbalance can lead to deterioration suggesting that too little or too much exercise may exacerbate it. More recently a biobehavioural model has been suggested to explain the benefits that exercise may have upon cancer-related fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Majid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Majid 2009</LINK>). The model encompasses biological, psycho-behavioral and functional variables that are implicated in the induction of cancer-related fatigue.</P>
<P>The benefit of exercise may not be limited to the improvement of the physical dimension of fatigue. It could also relieve the emotional and mental dimensions. Exercise has been demonstrated to improve mood and reduce anxiety and fear in patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dimeo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimeo 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two complementary Cochrane systematic reviews focusing on the treatment of cancer-related fatigue at all stages of cancer. These complementary reviews have examined the role of drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Minton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minton 2010</LINK>) and psychosocial interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Goedendorp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedendorp 2009</LINK>) in modifying cancer-related fatigue. However, there is currently no definitive stand on exercise for cancer-related fatigue from the American College of Sports Medicine, with minimal detail given on exercise prescription in those that do recommend it (<LINK REF="REF-Lucia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mustian-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustian 2007</LINK>). Furthermore there is limited information on specific groups of cancer patients where caution may be required (<LINK REF="REF-Mustian-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustian 2007</LINK>). This review update was conducted to analyse the increasing number of trials and where possible to identify the optimal exercise for reducing cancer-related fatigue.</P>

<P>To evaluate the effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment.</P>
<P>A secondary objective, subject to available data, was to explore the effect of exercise in different types of cancer populations.

<P>Included studies needed to evaluate and report the effect of physical exercise on cancer-related fatigue. The studies should compare exercise with no exercise, a usual care group (i.e. no specific exercise programme prescribed) or an alternative treatment or exercise regime for fatigue associated with cancer. The intervention could take place in any setting and be delivered to a group or individual participant. All types of physical exercise were considered for inclusion, including aerobic exercise, strength training and flexibility exercises. Studies that investigated an exercise programme accompanied by attempts to promote participant engagement were included. In contrast, studies that explored multi-dimensional programmes in which the effects of exercise alone could not be determined were excluded. Studies were also excluded if a specific exercise programme was not described and participants were only given advice or education about the potential benefits of exercise. </P>

<P>We retrieved all studies in which the abstract made reference to an exercise trial in a population of cancer participants in full.

<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table, computer random number generator); high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment for whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk of bias (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect the results. We assessed blinding specifically in relation to the fatigue outcome.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data). We assessed the completeness of fatigue outcome data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We assessed methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data, missing outcome data balanced across groups); high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups, intention-to-treat analysis not performed); unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias). We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified fatigue outcomes have been reported); high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified fatigue outcomes have been reported); unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<P>Fatigue outcomes were likely to be reported in different ways in the identified studies. It was therefore difficult to predict what data would be available to be combined. If the data were available, and it was appropriate to do so, we proposed that the studies would be combined in a meta-analysis. We proposed to calculate the mean difference in fatigue intensity between exercise and control groups including usual care and alternative treatment groups. Subgroup analysis would also be conducted if the data were available. Separate analysis would be implemented according to tumour type, for example breast cancer participants; treatment received, for example chemotherapy or radiotherapy; and the stage of treatment the participant was at when the exercise programme was administered, that is either during or after cancer treatment. If heterogeneity between studies was suspected, the possibility of utilising a random-effects model of meta-analysis would be considered. Further to this and if the information was available, we proposed to calculate the number of participants who experienced at least a 50% reduction in fatigue. This would be used to calculate the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for a 50% reduction in fatigue.</P>

<P>In the original review, following a comprehensive literature search including screening of titles and abstracts (where available), we retrieved 51 full-text references. From these, we excluded 23 publications and identified 28 (2083 participants) as appropriate for inclusion in the current review. In the updated search we retrieved a further 58 full-text references following screening of titles and abstracts (where available). From these publications, we excluded 23, a further seven were found to be linked to previous studies and we identified 28 (n = 1985 participants) as appropriate for inclusion in the updated review. The 28 studies from the original review and the 28 new studies provided a total of 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion in the review. In addition, through correspondence with study authors, we identified two protocols for appropriate studies; both studies were still in progress and not yet published and are therefore included in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.</P>

The intensity of exercise varied greatly across studies with comparison complicated by the method used to monitor intensity in each study. This included methods such as heart rate monitoring, predicted oxygen uptake, patient perceived effort using the Borg scale and self paced exercise intensity. The frequency and duration of the exercise sessions also varied greatly between studies with participants encouraged to exercise between two times per week and daily for 10 to 120 minutes per session. In some studies the frequency or duration, or both, was increased incrementally each week whereas in other studies the duration was based upon individual tolerance. The overall time spent exercising for each of the groups was rarely reported.</P>
<P>In the majority of studies (k = 34) the comparison arm was described as a 'no intervention' or 'usual care' control group although in three of the 34 studies the participants received a weekly phone call regarding their symptom experience (<LINK REF="STD-Windsor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2010a</LINK>). In a further 10 cases the comparison arm was a 'wait list' control (that is, the control group participants remained on a waiting list and were offered the intervention once the study was complete). Alternative comparison groups included relaxation training (<LINK REF="STD-Dimeo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dimeo 2004</LINK>), general stretching or range of movement exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Drouin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drouin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2008</LINK>), light weights and stretching (<LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2008</LINK>), Tai Chi (<LINK REF="STD-Galantino-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Galantino 2003</LINK>) and group psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003c</LINK>). In two studies the participants in the control group received usual care but were also encouraged to remain active (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coleman-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Coleman 2003a</LINK>) and in a further study the control arm patients were given written materials relating to general physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2009</LINK>). In addition to the 'usual care' comparison group <LINK REF="STD-Daley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 2007</LINK> also included a placebo group in which participants performed light intensity body conditioning exercises. No details were provided relating to the comparison group in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Burnham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burnham 2002</LINK>. In two studies both arms received an exercise intervention, the first of these compared physical activity with physical activity delivered alongside a cognitive behavioural therapy to reduce fatigue (<LINK REF="STD-van-Weert-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Weert 2010</LINK>); the second compared a group-based intervention to personal training (<LINK REF="STD-Santa-Mina-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Santa Mina 2012</LINK>).</P>

In some studies duration of the intervention varied between participants, being based upon the duration of cancer treatment. Stratification during randomisation was carried out in the majority of studies in attempt to account for this variation.</P>

<P>We initially assessed the included studies for quality using the Oxford Quality Score (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) and in the updated review we also assessed studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Following discussion there was 100% agreement in scores between the two review authors. The majority of studies scored two or three on the Oxford Quality Score. All studies lost two points due to the inability to conceal group allocation of study participants to the exercise intervention. It was also noted that observer blinding was rarely reported in the included studies. Studies that scored two lost a further point due to an incomplete description of drop-outs or an inadequate description of the method of randomisation. In general the Oxford Quality Score was higher in studies that were published more recently. However, it should also be noted that only five of the 56 studies were published prior to 2003. Oxford Quality Scores and 'Risk of bias' tables for each study are presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and a summary of the risk of bias is presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>

<P>A number of the included studies were limited by a small sample size with 24 studies recruiting fewer that 40 participants. Sample size ranged from 10 to 242 with a mean sample size of 69 participants and a median of 52.5. Thirty of the 56 studies either did not carry out or did not report a sample size calculation. The remaining 26 studies carried out a sample size calculation although only 10 of these recruited the required number of participants. Nine studies used fatigue as the basis of the sample size calculation with only four of the nine achieving their recruitment target.</P>
<P>Sixteen of the identified studies either provided no information regarding adherence to the prescribed intervention or did not report it in a meaningful way. The remaining 40 studies provided data on adherence to the exercise intervention with some of the studies also reporting exercise levels for the comparison group. Methods for reporting adherence varied between studies, for example, some studies reported the percentage of supervised sessions attended whereas others were based upon subjective reporting of exercise. Comparison between studies was complicated by the different methods used for reporting, however, for the studies that reported the percentage of supervised sessions attended adherence varied between 61% (<LINK REF="STD-Milne-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 2008</LINK>) and 98.4% (<LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003b</LINK>). A few of the studies monitored activity in the comparison group and acknowledged that the level of exercise may have resulted in some participants in the control group carrying out similar levels of activity to individuals in the intervention group. Three studies compared time spent exercising between the intervention and comparison group; all three reported that the intervention group performed exercise for a statistically longer period during the intervention period (<LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2007</LINK>). For analysis purposes all studies considered participants in the group to which they had been assigned, regardless of adherence, hence the estimated benefit of exercise did not take into consideration whether or not the participants adhered to the prescribed activity.</P>
<P>Only 11 of the 56 studies failed to provide adequate information regarding participants who withdrew or dropped out of the study. In the majority of cases participants who dropped out or withdrew were not included in the analysis although this was not entirely clear in all studies. Definition of intention-to-treat analysis varied between studies with some studies using this term to describe the inclusion of non-adherent participants in the analysis, whereas others used the term to describe the inclusion of participants who failed to complete the outcome measures or lost contact with the investigators, or both.</P>
<P>Follow-up assessment of long-term outcomes was poor with 35 of the 56 studies failing to assess outcomes beyond the end of the intervention period. From the remaining studies that did include a follow-up assessment, four did not present the follow-up data in the original publication (<LINK REF="STD-Headley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Headley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Culos_x002d_Reed-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Culos-Reed 2010</LINK>).

<P>The primary outcome was not identified in all studies, with the majority of studies employing multiple outcome measures. Fatigue reduction alone was the main purpose of the intervention in only eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dimeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dimeo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dimeo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dimeo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Heim 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuen-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Yuen 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adamsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Adamsen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2010a</LINK>). In the remaining studies fatigue was either one of two or more main outcomes, a secondary outcome or reported as a sub scale of a quality of life measure. In 11 of the studies improvement in quality of life was identified as the single main purpose of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chandwani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chandwani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2010</LINK>).

<P>Twenty-eight studies were identified for inclusion in the original review and an additional 28 in the updated review, providing 56 studies for inclusion (n = 4068 participants). For the purposes of meta-analysis, where data were not reported in full, we made an attempt to contact the corresponding author (n = 30). Twelve of the 30 authors subsequently provided post-test mean data +/- standard deviation (SD) for the fatigue outcome employed. The remaining authors either did not respond, could not be located or reported that the data were not available. In the original review we carried out separate meta-analyses on fatigue data using post-test means and change data. The two comparisons provided very similar results and we subsequently decided to base the remaining comparisons on the post-test means as the data were more readily available. For the purposes of the updated review all comparisons were based upon post-test means.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>This review provides evidence that exercise is beneficial in the management of cancer-related fatigue. Statistically significant improvements in fatigue were identified following an exercise programme carried out either during cancer therapy or following cancer therapy. Further to this, statistically significant beneficial effects were identified specific to breast cancer and prostate cancer populations but not for those with haematological malignancies. It remains to be determined whether the type of cancer treatment alters the beneficial effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue. Statistically beneficial effects were identified following aerobic training but not following resistance training or low-intensity mind-body interventions.</P>

In addition, moderate statistical heterogeneity was present for the total fatigue (P = 0.03; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 33.0%), breast cancer fatigue (P = 0.06; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 36.0%) and the aerobic exercise (P = 0.20; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 20.0%) meta-analyses. A high level of statistical heterogeneity was present in the meta-analyses of studies investigating exercise after cancer therapy (P &lt; 0.0002; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 72.0%) and in the prostate cancer population (P = 0.03; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59.0%). However, the meta-analysis of studies carried out during cancer therapy (P = 0.94; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), in haematological patients (P = 0.91; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), for resistance exercise (P = 0.91; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) and for mind-body exercise (P = 0.53; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) provided no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. The lack of statistical heterogeneity does not exclude heterogeneity, given the small numbers.</P>
<P>Despite a comprehensive search strategy all studies included were published in the English language. This may reflect selective publication of English language studies with statistically significant findings.</P>
<P>Data were not available for the purpose of meta-analysis for all studies retrieved and identified as suitable. The studies which have not reported the data in full tended to be those that have not identified a favourable outcome for exercise, therefore the results of the meta-analysis may have been biased in the direction of a positive outcome, making exercise appear more effective. Selective reporting of statistically significant outcomes may also have occurred.</P>
<P>For the purpose of inclusion in the review all studies recorded fatigue as an outcome, however, the primary purpose of the exercise interventions varied between studies. The exercise may therefore have been designed for an alternative purpose, resulting in a lack of beneficial effect for fatigue.</P>
<P>The results of the review should not be considered in isolation as there are a range of non-pharmacological interventions that may be considered beneficial in the management of cancer-related fatigue. Interventions that may be delivered in conjunction with an exercise programme include, but are not limited to, psychosocial therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goedendorp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedendorp 2009</LINK>), stress management, nutrition therapy and sleep therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Mustian-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustian 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the included studies</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the included studies was variable with the more recent studies generally being of better quality. It is acknowledged that blinding participants to an exercise intervention may not be a feasible option although methods to reduce this risk of bias should be carefully considered in future trials.</P>
<P>Few of the included studies provided information about people who refused participation in the trial. It is possible that the included participants differed statistically to those who refused participation, particularly in relation to their attitudes towards an exercise programme. It is possible that those who declined to participate would not have achieved the same benefits from an exercise programme as those who chose to participate. Some studies did indicate the main reasons for individuals refusing to participate which included a lack of interest in the study, a refusal or inability to travel, being too busy or having other commitments, a refusal to be randomised and not wanting to be reminded of their cancer.</P>
<P>Statistical power was limited by the small number of participants in several studies. Furthermore, in several studies, fatigue was not identified as the primary outcome, thus sample size calculations (where reported) were based upon a different outcome measure.</P>
<P>The majority of studies were carried out with breast cancer populations. Further research in this area needs to include participants with various cancer diagnoses or other specific cancer populations at various stages of disease, including those receiving palliative care.</P>
<P>In some studies the control groups received less attention from healthcare or research staff, or both, in comparison to the intervention groups. The additional attention may have resulted in a systematic bias (Hawthorne effect) in favour of the intervention.</P>
<P>Few studies included long-term follow-up measures and these were not always reported. Further to this a number of studies implemented short-term interventions (approximately three weeks) which may not have been long enough to produce any statistically significant effects in relation to fatigue.</P>
<P>According to the most recent recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>) adults should undertake moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity for at least 30 minutes on five days per week or vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity for at least 20 minutes on three days each week. The majority of exercise interventions reviewed did not reach these recommendations as exercise was only undertaken two to three times per week at moderate intensity. Twelve of the studies included an intervention that met these recommendations although the participants may have been advised to start at a lower level and progress to 30 minutes on five days per week (<LINK REF="STD-Mock-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mock 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Courneya-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Courneya 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dimeo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dimeo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drouin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Drouin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adamsen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Adamsen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mustian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mustian 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2009</LINK>). This step-wise progression is in line with the recommendations from the ACSM (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>). It should be noted that the ACSM guidelines were developed for healthy individuals and may need to be adapted for cancer survivors according to the stage of disease and adjuvant treatment. ACSM have developed guidelines for older adults which highlight the importance of combined aerobic, resistance and flexibility exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Chodzko_x002d_Zajko-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chodzko-Zajko 2009</LINK>). These guidelines may be more appropriate for cancer survivors but due to insufficient evidence the optimal exercise programme has not yet been established (<LINK REF="REF-Chodzko_x002d_Zajko-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chodzko-Zajko 2009</LINK>). This is in line with the ACSM Roundtable Consensus Statement that recognised the need to adapt exercise programmes for the individual cancer survivor according to health status, adjuvant treatment and anticipated disease trajectory (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2010</LINK>). The statement does, however, recommend that all cancer survivors should maintain and increase muscle mass (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2010</LINK>). The effect of resistance training upon fatigue is inconclusive as although there was a trend observed in favour of resistance training this failed to reach significance. In agreement with the current review the consensus group concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend alternative forms of exercise such as yoga and tai chi (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitz 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>A wide range of unidimensional and multidimensional outcome measures were used in the included studies which has prevented direct comparisons between studies. Data regarding fatigue were not always reported in full or adequately for the purposes of combining outcomes in a meta-analysis. We made attempts to contact authors where data were not available. It is recommended that multidimensional measures should be used to accurately assess fatigue to ensure that the effects of the intervention are captured in full. For example, an exercise intervention may have beneficial effects on mental and emotional fatigue levels but not physical fatigue levels. These effects would not be captured with a unidimensional tool.</P>
<P>The fatigue measures that were used do not have validated cut-off scores for mild/moderate/severe fatigue. In addition only one of the outcome measures used had validated minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) (FACT-F; <LINK REF="REF-Cella-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cella 2002</LINK>), hence it was not possible to determine the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) from the data obtained. Included studies did not provide estimates of effect size that could be pooled.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adherence and contamination</HEADING>
<P>Several studies indicated that participants completed exercise diaries although the results of these were frequently not reported. The accuracy of reporting in exercise diaries has also been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Montoye-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montoye 1996</LINK>). Group contamination has previously been reported in studies investigating exercise. This may occur when the control participants undertake exercise or the exercise group do not adhere to the programme. Further contamination may occur when participants do not undertake the exercise at the prescribed intensity or for the prescribed duration. Monitoring of exercise is more difficult when the prescribed programme is home-based or unsupervised, or both. It is possible that implementation of an exercise programme should be accompanied by a behavioural change intervention to ensure that participants are supported. Only one study monitored participants' self efficacy, which may be an important predictor of adherence to the exercise intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2005</LINK>). Adherence to an exercise programme may be lower during cancer treatment as a result of associated adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Oldervoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldervoll 2004</LINK>), hence patients may require additional support to remain active at this time. Recent research has indicated that providing cancer patients with supporting printed material regarding the exercise or with physical activity monitoring devices may increase levels of physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Vallance-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallance 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty studies provided overall evidence that aerobic exercise is beneficial in the management of fatigue both during and after cancer treatment and should therefore be considered as one component of a management strategy for fatigue that may include a range of other interventions and education. These findings related specifically to those with solid tumours.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-24 09:19:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further work is necessary to determine the most effective parameters of exercise for fatigue management including multi-modal exercise (combined aerobic and resistance), frequency and duration of each exercise session, and intensity of exercise. Future studies should also incorporate a long-term follow-up. Twenty eight of the included studies were carried out in breast cancer populations therefore future research needs to be undertaken with a broad range of diagnoses, including patients with advanced disease and those receiving palliative care.</P>
<P>Consensus is also needed on the most appropriate multi-dimensional outcome measure to use. Further work is required to determine cut-off scores and minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for each of the selected measures.</P>
<P>Future research also needs to consider issues of maximising adherence and promoting self efficacy to exercise as well as identifying the barriers and facilitators to exercise in people with a cancer diagnosis. Other limitations of the existing research that need to be addressed include concealment of group allocation and observer blinding. Trials also need to be adequately powered to detect a change in fatigue. It is likely that the large number of studies with small numbers of participants may be due to limited funding available for non-commercial trials. Funding agencies may therefore like to consider funding large studies to determine optimal exercise parameters for this patient group.</P>
