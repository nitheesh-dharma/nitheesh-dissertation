<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-14 15:49:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>There is not enough evidence to show the effects of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery rather than a policy of planned vaginal delivery for the birth of premature babies.</P>
<P>Caesarean section is an operation performed to deliver a baby through a cut in the abdomen and womb. Planned caesarean delivery for women thought to be in preterm labour may be protective for the baby, also preventing an intrapartum emergency surgery with its associated complications, but could also be traumatic for both the mother and her baby. More often than not, women thought to be in preterm labour deliver weeks later, often at term. There is, therefore, a real possibility that a policy of planned caesarean section may increase the number of babies born preterm.</P>
<P>We included six randomised studies (involving 122 pregnant women) but only four studies (involving 116 women) contributed to the analyses. Our review found that there is not enough reliable evidence to compare planned caesarean delivery with planned vaginal delivery. Sometimes a planned caesarean cannot happen because labour progresses too quickly and sometimes, even though vaginal delivery is planned, complications arising during labour may make a caesarean section necessary. The review found that not enough women have been recruited into trials and, therefore, the decision how best to deliver a preterm baby, either cephalic or breech presentation, remains opinion and current practice within a hospital, rather than being evidence-based.</P>
<P>All four trials were stopped early, due to difficulties with recruiting women. There were no data on serious maternal complications including admissions to intensive care unit. However, there were seven cases of major maternal postpartum complications in the group allocated to planned caesarean section (wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, endotoxic shock and puerperal sepsis) and none in the group randomised to vaginal delivery. Excess blood loss from the birth canal after childbirth (postpartum haemorrhage) was not clearly different between the two groups, nor was birth asphyxia or respiratory distress syndrome or injury to the baby at birth.</P>

<B>Infant</B>
</P>
<P>There were very little data of relevance to the three main (primary) outcomes considered in this review: There was no significant difference between planned immediate caesarean section and planned vaginal delivery with respect to birth injury to infant (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.62; one trial, 38 women) or birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women). The only cases of birth trauma were a laceration of the buttock in a baby who was delivered by caesarean section and mild bruising in another allocated to the group delivered vaginally.</P>
<P>The difference between the two groups with regard to perinatal deaths was not significant (0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.14; three trials, 89 women) and there were no data specifically relating to neonatal admission to special care and/or intensive care unit.</P>
<P>There was also no difference between the caesarean or vaginal delivery groups in terms of markers of possible birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.60; four trials, 115 women) and no difference in attempts at breastfeeding (RR 1.40, 95% 0.11 to 17.45; one trial, 12 women). There was also no difference in neonatal fitting/seizures (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.32; three trials, 77 women), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 82.01;one trial, 12 women) or respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.10; three trials, 103 women). There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to meconium aspiration. There was also no significant difference between the two groups for abnormal follow-up in childhood (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.22; one trial, 38 women) or delivery less than seven days after entry (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; two trials, 51 women).</P>
<P>
<B>Mother</B>
</P>
<P>There were no data reported on maternal admissions to intensive care. However, there were seven cases of major maternal postpartum complications in the group allocated to planned immediate caesarean section and none in the group randomised to vaginal delivery (RR 7.21, 95% CI 1.37 to 38.08; four trials, 116 women).</P>
<P>There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to maternal satisfaction (postnatal). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to postpartum haemorrhage. A number of non-prespecified secondary outcomes were also considered in the analyses. There was a significant advantage for women in the vaginal delivery group with respect to maternal puerperal pyrexia (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.53; three trials, 89 women) and other maternal infection (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.78; three trials, 103 women), but no significant differences in wound infection (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.18 to 7.70; three trials, 103 women), maternal stay more than 10 days (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.65; three trials, 78 women) or the need for blood transfusion (results not estimable).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-15 12:46:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>The optimal mode of delivery for women thought to be in preterm labour is controversial. Claims that planned preterm caesarean delivery reduces the chances of fetal or neonatal death and birth trauma have been met by counter claims that such a policy leads to risk of serious morbidity for both mother and baby.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Malloy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malloy 1991</LINK> found no evidence that caesarean section can be protective for preterm neonates, especially for very low birthweight infants (less than 1500 g). The same author published further evidence that, for intermediate or late low-risk preterm neonates (32 to 36 weeks), primary caesarean section may in fact increase risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity, such as pulmonary hypoplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis or sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Malloy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malloy 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Caesarean section is known to be associated with an increased risk of respiratory morbidity in neonates, because hormonal and physiological changes associated with labour are necessary for lung maturation in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gravenhorst-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravenhorst 1993</LINK> on the other hand, found a trend towards reduced neonatal mortality rate in preterm (before 32 weeks) or very low weight (less than 1500 g) babies with breech presentation born by caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery. There is also a question to what extent the data from the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>) may be applicable to preterm births. The Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>) showed a reduction in perinatal mortality from 13/1000 to 3/1000 (risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.81) and a reduction in serious neonatal morbidity from 3.8 to 1.4 per cent with planned caesarean section (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65). No differences were reported between the two groups regarding the health of the infant at three months follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2002</LINK>, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.23) and equal rates of death or neurodevelopmental delay (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2004</LINK>, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.30) were evidenced at follow-up two years after the trial.</P>
<P>In the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>) maternal complications were similar in both groups, but the data about possible excess maternal morbidity and mortality (or lack of it) for women who undergo planned caesarean section are quite complex. In the 2005 WHO global survey on maternal and perinatal health (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2007</LINK>), the risk for caesarean section compared to vaginal delivery was three to five times higher for maternal death, twice higher for hysterectomy, and again twice higher for being admitted to intensive care and hospital stay of more than seven days. Postnatal infection (pyrexia, endometritis, puerperal sepsis), thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and excessive blood loss are indeed higher after caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1985</LINK>). However, a lot of these complications may be a consequence of underlying causes that lead to the need for caesarean section, particularly when the procedure is carried out as an intrapartum emergency. Planned caesarean section may be, therefore, seen as a way of preventing an intrapartum emergency surgery and its associated complications.</P>
<P>Another problem, particularly for preterm caesarean sections, is that the lower segment (where the uterine incision is usually performed) may not have formed. Consequently, a vertical incision of the upper part of the uterus may be necessary. In this instance, more complications can occur, including heavier blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1990</LINK>), and the need to perform future deliveries by caesarean section, because of the lack of strength of the womb scar. Furthermore, caesarean section for first birth seems to be associated with an increased risk of placenta praevia and placental abruption in the second pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Yanq-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanq 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The concept of planned caesarean section for preterm birth implies that it is possible to diagnose preterm birth accurately and perform caesarean section very early in labour or just before labour starts. This is clearly not the case as, more often than not, women thought to be in preterm labour deliver weeks later, often at term. There is, therefore, a real possibility that a policy of planned caesarean section may increase the number of babies born preterm.</P>
<P>The risk associated with excess preterm births may be reduced with corticosteroids given before delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>) and magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review aims to address the issue of best mode of delivery for preterm births in singleton pregnancy. The mode of delivery in multiple pregnancies is addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Stock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stock 2012</LINK>).</P>

</OL>
<P>We acknowledge the ambiguity with the term "planned" caesarean section. A planned caesarean section normally means that it is scheduled before the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>). However, for the purposes of this review, we refer to the term "planned immediate caesarean section", meaning a caesarean section which is planned only after the labour has started. When a woman presents in preterm labour, the issue is whether to deliver immediately by caesarean section to prevent preterm vaginal birth, or to aim to deliver vaginally with recourse to caesarean section if problems develop (<LINK REF="STD-Penn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 1996</LINK>). Planned immediate caesarean section in the context of this review implies performing caesarean section as soon as the spontaneous preterm birth is thought to be inevitable. However, this decision to perform caesarean section may be delayed in order to give corticosteroids to the mother before birth of the baby.</P>

<P>A total of only 116 women were recruited to the four trials contributing to the analyses reported in this review.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review, data were included from a trial (<LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 1986</LINK>) that had recruited only two women. Both women were randomised to the same group (caesarean delivery). The data for those two women were added to the data for the four women recruited to a separate Australian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lumley-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lumley 1985</LINK>) which also stopped at a very early stage. In this version of the review because of the extreme paucity of data, and because the original data from these trials is not now available, these trials are not included in the analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">For the infant</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were very little data relating to the three main (primary) outcomes considered in this review. There was no significant difference between planned immediate caesarean section and planned vaginal delivery with respect to birth injury to infant (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.62; one trial, 38 women, (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>)) or birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women, (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> )). The only cases of birth trauma were a laceration of the buttock in a baby who was delivered electively by caesarean section (<LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1985</LINK>) and mild bruising in another allocated to the expectant group and delivered vaginally (<LINK REF="STD-Penn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The difference between the two groups with regard to perinatal deaths was not significant (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.14; three trials, 89 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>)) and there were no data specifically relating to neonatal admission to special care and/or intensive care unit.</P>
<P>There was no difference between the caesarean or vaginal delivery groups in hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (a condition of injury to the brain) (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 82.01; one trial, 12 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>)), in attempts at breastfeeding (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 17.45; one trial, 12 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>)) or in terms of markers of possible birth asphyxia, i.e. cord pH being below the normal range (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 143.89; two trials, 33 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was also no significant difference between the two groups for abnormal follow-up in childhood (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.22; one trial, 38 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>)), in neonatal fitting/seizures (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.32; three trials, 77 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>)), in low Apgar score at five minutes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.60; four trials, 115 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>)), respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.10; three trials, 103 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>)) or delivery less than seven days after entry (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; two trials, 51 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.02; Chi² = 1.66, df = 1 (P = 0.20); I² = 40% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to meconium aspiration (where the newborn inhales a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid, either in the uterus or just after delivery).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Non prespecified secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We have also included a number of non-prespecified outcomes: cord prolapse (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>); need for mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>); ventilation (days) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>); supplemental oxygen (days) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>); neonatal jaundice (<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>) - none of them showed important differences between the two groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For the mother</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were no data reported on maternal admissions admission to intensive care. However, there were significantly more cases of major maternal postpartum complications (wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, endotoxic shock and puerperal sepsis) in the group allocated to planned immediate caesarean section compared with the group randomised to vaginal delivery (RR 7.21, 95% CI 1.37 to 38.08; four trials, 116 women, (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The included studies did not report data on maternal satisfaction (postnatal) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to postpartum haemorrhage (excess blood loss from the birth canal after childbirth) (RR 3.69, 95% CI 0.16 to 83.27; four trials, 105 women (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>)).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Non prespecified secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A number of non-prespecified secondary outcomes were also considered in the analyses. There was a significant advantage for women in the vaginal delivery group with respect to maternal puerperal pyrexia (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.53; three trials, 89 women, (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>)) and other maternal infection (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.78, three trials, 103 women, (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>)), although only just significant, P = 0.05), but no significant differences in wound infection (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>), maternal stay more than 10 days (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>) or the need for blood transfusion (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of compliance with allocated intervention, 20% (9/46) of women allocated to elective caesarean section were actually delivered vaginally, usually because the delivery was too rapid to allow a caesarean to be performed. Twenty-one per cent (9/43) of women allocated to vaginal delivery were delivered by caesarean section, usually because of fetal distress.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-14 16:52:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>Only 116 women were recruited to the four trials contributing to the analyses reported in this review. All four trials were stopped early, due to difficulties with recruitment. Therefore, any firm conclusions regarding the relative merits of planned immediate caesarean section versus planned vaginal delivery should not be drawn from this review in order to guide current clinical practice.</P>
<P>The need for more 'intention-to-treat' data from properly controlled trials is essential.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-04-13 16:40:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>Eighteen of 89 babies (20%) were not delivered by the planned mode (<LINK REF="STD-Penn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlatnik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zlatnik 1993</LINK>). This reflects rapid progress of preterm labour and results in vaginal birth despite caesarean section being planned. On the other hand, problems developing during labour may require caesarean section despite aiming for vaginal birth. Any attempt to perform 'on treatment' analysis should be resisted, as it introduces considerable bias. The bias is likely to favour vaginal birth as quick, appropriately monitored preterm births tend to be uncomplicated, particularly for the mother, whilst intrapartum emergency caesarean sections when vaginal births were planned are likely to be particular risky for both mother and baby.</P>
<P>It is also noteworthy that the infants who fared worst in Zlatnik's study (as judged by cord blood pH and perinatal death) were those whose mothers were delivered too rapidly to be recruited to the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zlatnik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zlatnik 1993</LINK>). The problem was not due to vaginal delivery, but undiagnosed labour which was therefore not monitored.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-14 16:55:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>Given that very few women have been recruited to trials of planned immediate caesarean section versus planned vaginal delivery for preterm birth, and that the quality of the trials conducted is generally unclear, we recommend that firm conclusions regarding the relative merits of planned immediate caesarean section versus planned vaginal delivery should not be drawn from this evidence to guide practice for preterm births.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-24 15:21:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>Failure to successfully recruit to all trials carried out thus far highlights the challenges with recruitment in this area. We hope that this review will contribute further to the equipoise that, surely, must exist. We are confident that, with adequate resources and growing recognition about how important it is to base clinical decisions on sound evidence, well designed randomised trials are possible.</P>

</OL>
<P>We acknowledge the ambiguity with the term "planned" caesarean section. A planned caesarean section normally means that it is scheduled before the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>). However, for the purposes of this review, we refer to the term "planned immediate caesarean section", meaning a caesarean section which is planned only after the labour has started. When a woman presents in preterm labour, the issue is whether to deliver immediately by caesarean section to prevent preterm vaginal birth, or to aim to deliver vaginally with recourse to caesarean section if problems develop (<LINK REF="STD-Penn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 1996</LINK>). Planned immediate caesarean section in the context of this review implies performing caesarean section as soon as the spontaneous preterm birth is thought to be inevitable. However, this decision to perform caesarean section may be delayed in order to give corticosteroids to the mother before birth of the baby.'</P>
