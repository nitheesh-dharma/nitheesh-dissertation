<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-13 12:30:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Rupture of the Achilles tendon is common and said to be increasing. It typically occurs in males in their 30s and 40s who play sport intermittently. People present with severe pain in the tendon, at the back of the ankle. Signs include a palpable gap at the rupture site, and marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion (movement so toes point downwards). Options for management include non-surgical interventions (plaster of Paris, bracing or splinting) or surgical repair of the tendon. Following either method of treatment, the ankle may be immobilised for up to 12 weeks (in a cast, allowing no movement at the ankle and variable weight-bearing), or mobilised early (in a brace, allowing movement at the ankle and partial to full weight-bearing).</P>
<P>Twelve trials including 794 participants acute Achilles tendon rupture were included. The majority of participants were male, and the average ages of the study populations were between 36 to 41 years. Many of the trials had flawed methods that undermined the reliability of their results.</P>
<P>Open surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment (6 studies, 502 participants) was associated with a lower risk of rerupture, but a higher risk of other complications such as infection, adhesions and disturbed skin sensibility (numbness and tingling). There were insufficient and inconclusive data on function and sporting activities.</P>
<P>Percutaneous repair (involving stab incisions through which the repair suture is passed through without direct exposure of the tendon) compared with open repair (4 studies, 174 participants) was associated with a lower risk of infection. These figures should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved. Similarly, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different tendon repair techniques (3 studies, 141 participants).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-06-29 12:55:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Two review authors independently selected potentially eligible trials; trials were then assessed for quality using a 10-item scale. Where possible, data were pooled.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-16 09:08:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Twelve trials involving 844 participants were included. One trial tested two comparisons.</P>
<P>Quality assessment revealed a poor level of methodological rigour in many studies, particularly with regard to concealment of allocation and the lack of assessor blinding.</P>
<P>Open surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment (6 trials, 536 participants) was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of rerupture (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.77), but a higher risk of other complications including infection (RR 4.89, 95% CI 1.09 to 21.91), adhesions and disturbed skin sensibility (numbness). Functional status including sporting activity was variably and often incompletely reported, including frequent use of non standardised outcome measures, and the results were inconclusive.</P>
<P>Open surgical repair compared with percutaneous repair (4 trials, 174 participants) was associated with a higher risk of infection (RR 9.32, 95% CI 1.77 to 49.16). These figures should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved. Similarly, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different tendon repair techniques (3 trials, 147 participants).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-13 12:23:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Open surgical treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with non-surgical treatment, but produces significantly higher risks of other complications, including wound infection. The latter may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-16 09:14:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-07-16 09:13:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The Achilles tendon, formed by the merging of the tendons of gastrocnemius and soleus (the two largest calf muscles), is the thickest and strongest tendon in the human body. The tendon inserts into the back the foot just above the heel. Acute Achilles ruptures occur most commonly in males in their third and fourth decades who play sport intermittently; the left tendon is more commonly ruptured than the right (<LINK REF="REF-Hattrup-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hattrup 1985</LINK>). Achilles tendon rupture is associated with prolonged periods off work, and much longer abstinence from sporting activity (<LINK REF="REF-Cetti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cetti 1994</LINK>). The mechanisms of injury include sudden forced plantar flexion (equinus) of the foot (toes pointed down to the ground; e.g. during sporting activities), unexpected dorsiflexion of the foot (foot forced up towards the shin; e.g. during a fall down stairs), and violent dorsiflexion of a plantar flexed foot (foot initially positioned with the toes down towards the floor forced upwards towards the shin; e.g. a fall from a ladder) (<LINK REF="REF-Arner-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arner 1959</LINK>). The incidence is approximately 18 per 100,000 per year (in Finland) and is thought to be rising (<LINK REF="REF-Leppilahti-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leppilahti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maffulli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maffulli 1999</LINK>), possibly as a result of the increasing 'keep-fit' culture.</P>
<P>The underlying pathological mechanism is not fully understood, although it is generally accepted that ruptures occur in previously abnormal, but often asymptomatic tendons (<LINK REF="REF-Arner-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arner 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tallon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tallon 2001</LINK>). A number of aetiological theories have been proposed which include the adverse influence of oral and topical corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Mahler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newnham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newnham 1991</LINK>), fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) (<LINK REF="REF-Royer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royer 1994</LINK>), exercise-induced hyperthermia (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1994</LINK>) and mechanical abnormalities of the foot (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of an acute rupture can usually be made clinically. Ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-Maffulli-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maffulli 1990</LINK>) or magnetic resonance imaging (<LINK REF="REF-Deutsch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deutsch 1989</LINK>) may be used if confirmation is necessary.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-07-16 09:14:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Treatment can be broadly classified into surgical (open or percutaneous) and non-surgical (cast immobilisation or functional bracing). Generally, open surgical management has been used in athletes and young fit patients, percutaneous surgical in those who do not wish to have an open repair (e.g. for scar avoidance or cosmesis), and non-surgical in older or less active adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bossley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bossley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maffulli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maffulli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinelli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinelli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raisbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raisbeck 2000</LINK>). Different surgical techniques exist such as the six-strand repair, the less bulky two-strand repair (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1992</LINK>), augmentation of the primary repair with the use of a gastrocnemius flap as proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Silfverskiold-1941" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silfverskiold 1941</LINK> or with plantaris tendon (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional rehabilitation following Achilles tendon injury has involved prolonged protection of the tendon, usually in a plaster cast, followed by an extensive period of physiotherapy to regain lost muscle function and range of movement. Early mobilisation and weight-bearing has been introduced more recently to reduce complications of stiffness and weakness from muscle wasting and adhesions. Sceptics remain concerned about increased rerupture rates from early tendon loading.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-05-08 05:00:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Open surgery enables direct approximation (abutment) of disrupted tendon ends and an assessment of tendon length, but disrupts the blood supply to the tendon by damaging the paratenon (thin lining of a tendon which contains the blood vessels supplying the tendon). This is minimised by a percutaneous approach (minimal incisions with a suture passed blindly and tied) but there are concerns about the integrity of this repair and reports of increased sural nerve injury (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>). Surgical repair should minimise the rerupture rate (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>) but at the risk of complications (i.e. wound infection or nerve injury). Immobilisation in a plaster cast should allow the tendon to heal but at the cost of complications from immobilisation. As described above, functional brace treatment involving early mobilisation aims to avoid these complications but may increase the risk of a rerupture.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-29 13:32:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>There is lack of consensus on the best management of the acute Achilles tendon rupture, a relatively common and disabling injury in active people. Opinion is divided as to whether surgical or non surgical intervention is optimal, and which surgical methods (open or percutaneous) and repair techniques are best (<LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>). This review presents an update of the evidence for surgical interventions formerly presented in a Cochrane review that covered all interventions for these injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2005</LINK>). A separate review evaluating mobilisation strategies is in process.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>The 12 trials took place in one of nine countries: Denmark (2 trials), Finland (1 trial), Germany (1 trial), Italy (1 trial), The Netherlands (1 trial), New Zealand (1 trial), Sweden (2 trials), Turkey (2 trials) and the UK (1 trial). Trial publications range from 1981 (<LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>) to 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK>). Seven trials were multi-centre studies and five were single centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gigante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gigante 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 12 included trials involved 844 participants with acute Achilles tendon rupture. However, baseline data were only provided for 794 participants. Where described, the majority of participants were male. All participants were adults, and the median or mean ages of the study populations ranged from 36 to 41 years.</P>
<P>Seven studies reported the mechanism of injury, which was most commonly associated with sports participation. <LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK> reported 92/111 (82.9%) occurred during sport (badminton 58, soccer 10, gymnastics 10, handball 7, tennis 3, volleyball 3, dance 1). <LINK REF="STD-Gigante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gigante 2008</LINK> reported that all lesions were caused by indirect trauma (five a side soccer 35.0%, soccer 12.5%, volleyball and tennis 5.0%, skiing 2.5%, and other activities 15.0%). <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK> reported 52/66 (78.8%) ruptures occurred during sport (running 15, squash 15, soccer 8, netball 5, tennis 5, basketball 2, bowling 2). <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> reported the cause of the injury was sports, mainly ball sports, in 70/83 participants (84.3%). <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK> reported that 80/107 (74.8%) sustained an Achilles rupture whilst playing sport (most common were: 33 badminton, 15 soccer, 10 handball, 7 tennis, 15 other sports). <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK> reported that 49/60 (81.7%) sustained their injury participating in sport. <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK> reported that most ruptures occurred during sport but gave no details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The trials tested three comparisons: surgery versus non-surgical treatment; open versus percutaneous surgical repair; and different methods of surgical repair. These are described below. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>) with 43 participants tested open surgical repair versus percutaneous surgical repair versus non-surgical treatment and thus appears in two comparisons. In the following, the numbers of participants given are the numbers randomised.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Open surgical versus non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Six studies, involving 536 participants, compared open surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment. In four studies, surgical treatment involved end-to-end tendon suture plus paratenon repair, followed by six to nine weeks of immobilisation in either a cast (<LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>) or functional brace in equinus (plantar-flexed/foot down) (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>). Non-surgical treatment was with cast immobilisation for eight weeks: four weeks in equinus, four weeks in neutral (<LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>), semi-equinus (<LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>), or cast immobilisation for 10 days, followed by four weeks in an orthosis at 20 degrees in semi-equinus brought up to neutral for a further four weeks with periods of mobility out of the orthosis (<LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> reported on minimally invasive open repair versus non-surgical treatment with immediate weight bearing in 83 participants. The surgical group had a week in plaster followed by six weeks in tape bandage, and the non-surgical group had one week in plaster followed by six weeks in the Vacoped boot. <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK> reported on 28 participants randomised to open surgical repair versus non-surgical treatment; all participants were immobilised in a special boot with a 3 cm heel raise for four weeks followed by gradual reduction in heel size over the following four weeks. The 15 participants of the percutaneous group of <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK> are not included in this comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Open versus percutaneous surgical repair</HEADING>
<P>Four studies, involving 180 participants, compared open versus percutaneous surgical repair. <LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2009</LINK> compared percutaneous repair using the Achillon suture system (<LINK REF="REF-Assal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assal 2002</LINK>) versus an open Krakow end-to-end suture repair in 46 participants. Postoperative immobilisation was in a below knee cast for three weeks followed by a brace limiting dorsiflexion from three to six weeks, and then free weight bearing thereafter. <LINK REF="STD-Gigante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gigante 2008</LINK> compared percutaneous repair using the Tenolig kit (<LINK REF="REF-Delponte-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delponte 1992</LINK>) versus open repair using an open end-to-end Kessler type suture repair in 40 participants. The open group had an above knee plaster for 30 days, and the minimally invasive group had a dorsal splint for 15 days followed by an elasticated bandage for 15 days. <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK> compared open repair using a modified Kessler core suture (plus interrupted sutures) with percutaneous repair with a modified Ma and Griffith technique (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1977</LINK>) involving six or eight stab incisions in 66 participants. Postoperatively, participants were immobilised in a cast for 10 to 14 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK> compared open repair (single or double Kessler core suture) versus percutaneous repair (modified Ma and Griffith technique (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1977</LINK>)) in 28 participants. For this comparison, the non-surgical group of <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK> was excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Surgical techniques</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1992</LINK> compared two suture techniques in 57 participants: an open two-strand technique (Mason) with a continuous six-strand technique (CSSS); immobilisation was in a cast for seven weeks.</P>
<P>Two studies investigated augmented repair (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2007</LINK> compared plantaris augmented end-to-end Krakow suture repair versus simple end-to-end Krakow suture repair in 30 participants. Immobilisation was initially in a below knee cast in equinus, followed by conversion to a brace limiting dorsiflexion for eight weeks. Weight bearing was encouraged in the brace from four until eight weeks, and then with a heel raise until 12 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK> compared open surgical repair (Kessler type apposition) with or without an augmented repair (Silfverskiold type gastrocnemius fascial turndown) in 60 participants. Immobilisation for participants of both groups was in a brace allowing free active plantar flexion, with dorsiflexion limited to neutral for three weeks, and weight bearing limited for six weeks.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> respectively for the assessment criteria for judging trial methods and results of the assessment of the included trials for the individual criteria.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>This was assessed mainly on whether there was concealment of allocation (item 1 of quality assessment in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), and to a lesser degree on whether treatment and control groups were adequately described and well matched (item 3). We judged that allocation was concealed in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>). There was a high risk of selection bias in the two quasi-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>). Most of the remaining trials did not describe their method of randomisation. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gigante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gigante 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>) provided no or inadequate information on baseline characteristics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of performance bias was hampered by lack of information on surgeons' experience with the surgical techniques under investigation (item 4), with only <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> satisfying the assessment criteria. Eight trials provided comparable or identical care programmes other than the trialled interventions (item 5).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Detection / ascertainment bias</HEADING>
<P>Detection bias, assessed primarily on assessor blinding (item 7) was very likely given that none of the trials report using blinded assessors. Notably, outcomes were clearly defined (item 6) in all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>, which was reported only in a conference abstract.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>This was assessed by whether excluded or withdrawn participants were included in an intention-to-treat analysis (item 8), whether the follow up was adequate (item 9), and whether less than 5% were lost to follow up (item 10). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>). Most trials conducted adequate follow up (minimum 12 months), excluding <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2001</LINK> (6 months) and <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK> (mean 8 months).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open surgical versus non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>This was considered in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>) in a total of 536 participants. The percutaneous group of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK> are not included in this analysis. Surgery was performed by or was directed by specialist surgeons.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rerupture</HEADING>
<P>This was documented in all six studies. Pooled results showed significantly fewer reruptures in the surgically-treated group (12/240 (5.0%) versus 30/249 (12.0%), risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.77, P = 0.006; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Notably, <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK> reported that two reruptures in the surgical group and one rerupture in the non-surgical group were associated with significant trauma; the other two reruptures, one in each group, were attributed to non-compliance and were excluded from further analysis in this trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complications of treatment</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> presents a breakdown of the individual complications other than rerupture. Notable among these are scar adhesions, infections and sural nerve injuries or disturbed sensibility (e.g. numbness, hypersensitivity or tingling); all of which were significantly greater in the surgical treatment group. Separate data for superficial wound infection were not available in <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> but included in the tally for skin complications. Disregarding this, the overall wound infection rate was seven in the surgical group of which of six had deep wound infections, and none in the non-surgical group (RR 4.89, 95% CI 1.09 to 21.91, P = 0.04; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Pooled results of the all reported complications (other than rerupture) showed a greater incidence in the surgically treated group, but one which was not statistically significant when using the random-effects model (70/240 (29.2%) versus 20/249 (8.0%); RR 4.81, 95% CI 0.78 to 29.56; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). These results should be viewed with caution, because it is not clear whether some participants incurred more than complication and moreover these were a mixture of major and minor complications. There was also significant heterogeneity in these pooled results, in particular from the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> which had more complications (primarily skin-related conditions including fungal infection, pressure sores, blisters) in the non-surgical group that resolved upon removal of the functional brace.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Long term function (including sporting activity)</HEADING>
<P>Due to the variety of definitions of activity, the use of different scoring tools, and incomplete data recording, only limited pooling of results was possible.</P>
<P>Data for return to pre-injury level of sporting activity from five trials are tabulated in <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>. All differences between the two groups for return to the same level of previous sporting activity were not statistically significant in these trials, except for <LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK> which favoured the surgical treatment group. Pooled results, using the random-effects model, showed no difference between the two groups (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.39; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> used the Leppilhati functional assessment score, which is a validated assessment tool, and reported no differences between the groups: 26/32 (81.2%) participants in the surgical group, and 24/27 (88.9%) in the non-surgical group had good or excellent scores. <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK> used the musculoskeletal functional assessment index (MFAI), a 100-question validated outcome score for musculoskeletal injuries, and reported no differences between groups at all time intervals (<I>see </I>

However, this finding was reversed at three months and one year. Statistical significance was not reached at any time point. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK> assessed quality of life in the first eight weeks and at two years using visual analogue scales and found a highly statistically significant difference in favour of the surgical group at both follow-up times. <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK> reported that significantly more of the surgical group complained of stiffness of the ankle and increased tendon width than in the non-surgical group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-16 09:55:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Twelve randomised studies involving the treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures were included in this analysis. The quality assessment revealed a poor level of methodological rigour in many studies, particularly with lack of allocation concealment and blinded assessment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Open surgical versus non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>There was a consistent finding of significantly increased rerupture rate in the non-surgically treated participants. Summation of data gave a pooled incidence of 5.0 % in the surgically treated group and 12.0 % in the non-surgical group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). These figures should be interpreted with caution due to differences in the method and period of splintage used by the different studies. However, they support results from previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was also a consistent finding of increased complication rate (other than rerupture) in the surgically treated group, except for <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK>, who reported more skin problems associated with the functional brace regimen used in the non-surgical group. The most common complications in the surgical group were adhesions, altered sensation), and wound infection. Again, these findings support the findings of previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1997</LINK>). Notably, it cannot be confirmed if participants had more than one complication, and thus the pooled complication analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>No difference in function and return to sporting activities between the surgical and non-surgical groups was reported in four studies, using a variety of assessment techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nistor-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nistor 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cetti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cetti 1993</LINK> was the only study to report a significantly higher proportion of participants reaching their pre-injury level of activity following surgical management.</P>
<P>No statistically significant difference was reported in the duration of inpatient stay, although there was an expected trend for longer stay associated with surgery. Conflicting results were reported for the duration of time off work; therefore, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Type of work performed (e.g. manual versus office-based) plays an important role in determining a person's ability to return to employment; this was recorded in only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was marked non-uniformity in the reporting of participants' satisfaction as well as conflicting results between the studies. However the best assessment was made by <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK> used visual analogue scores and reported no differences between the groups at two, three and 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2001</LINK> used visual analogue scales: surgically treated participants had significantly better quality of life for up to two years post-rupture. Three studies reported no difference in power of plantar flexion at follow up. There were conflicting results reported for other objective measures of range of motion and calf atrophy.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2002</LINK> comparing open surgical and non-surgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon ruptures did not make a strong recommendation for surgery. <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2002</LINK> suggested that participants who are reluctant to undergo an operation may choose non-surgical treatment. Their meta-analysis included six studies, three of which have been omitted from the present meta-analysis based on inadequate reporting of results (<LINK REF="STD-Coombs-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coombs 1981</LINK>), early termination of control group because of high recurrence rate and no allocation concealment (personal communication with the author, <LINK REF="STD-Majewski-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Majewski 2000</LINK>), and inadequate randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Thermann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thermann 1995</LINK>). We included three extra studies that did fulfil our strict inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Metz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroeder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schroeder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twaddle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twaddle 2007</LINK>). Nevertheless, results reported by <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2002</LINK> are similar to ours: the rerupture rate was 4.3% for surgical participants and 11.7% for non-surgical participants (P = 0.005); and infection rates were higher in surgically treated participants (4.7% vs 0%, RR 4.6, P = 0.03).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Lo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1997</LINK> compiled two prospective trials and 17 case series in their comparison of surgical and non-surgical treatments. They were unable to recommend one treatment over the other based on the combined complication rates. They suggested that participants with poor healing potential be treated conservatively and that active participants be offered both conservative and surgical management.</P>
<P>In summary, non-surgically treated participants have over twice the risk of rerupture, but minimal risk of other complications from their treatment. Meanwhile, surgically treated participants are at risk of other complications, in particular infection, adhesions and nerve injury.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Open versus percutaneous surgical repair</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference in rerupture rates between the groups in the four small studies. However, there was a significantly higher rate of wound infection in the open surgical group. It should be noted that the rate of infection in the open group (18.2%) is significantly higher than in the open surgical group versus non-surgical studies (3.6%). There is no obvious explanation for this variation.</P>
<P>No definitive conclusions can be made regarding differences in activity levels or objective scores between the groups because of the limited number of participants involved, and non-standardised techniques of assessment.</P>
<P>In a previous review of prospective and retrospective studies regarding surgical and non-surgical management, <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2002</LINK> reported a lower wound complication rate in participants undergoing percutaneous repair. However, they also noted that those in the percutaneous group suffered relatively high complication rates (notably sural nerve injury), particularly if combined with early active mobilisation. Just one persistent sural nerve problem, which started at the time of the initial injury, was reported in the four trials of this comparison. This occurred in the percutaneous group.</P>
<P>In summary, the results on the small numbers of participants presented showed a tendency for a lower complication rate, notably wound infection, in the percutaneously treated group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Surgical techniques</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Two-strand versus six-strand open repair</HEADING>
<P>Only limited conclusions can be drawn from this single study involving 57 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1992</LINK>). However, the results suggest there is no advantage in using the more extensive 6-strand suture technique over the simpler 2-strand method.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Augmented versus simple repair</HEADING>
<P>Only limited conclusions can be drawn from the two trials testing augmented repair (<LINK REF="STD-Aktas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aktas 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Pajala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pajala 2009</LINK>). The results suggest there is no advantage to using a more extensive reconstruction involving a gastrocnemius turndown or plantaris reinforcement over the simpler Kessler type repair technique. All three deep infections requiring surgical intervention occurred in the augmented repair groups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-16 09:56:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>On the basis of the randomised studies reviewed, there is evidence that open surgical treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with non-surgical treatment, but has the drawback of a significantly higher risk of other complications, including wound infection. These complications appear to be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously, but this inference is based upon limited data from a small number of participants.</P>
<P>There is inadequate evidence to comment on different suture techniques, or the use of a more complex (augmented) reconstruction.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-16 10:17:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Further rigorously conducted randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes, full reporting of outcomes and blinding of assessors are required to establish the ideal surgical intervention and subsequent rehabilitation regimen. Such studies should be reported using the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>). Longer term follow up of functional outcome using standardised validated outcome measures is highly recommended. Increased transparency is needed where the same cohort of participants is reported on in later studies; this will facilitate meaningful data interpretation at meta-analysis. Avoidance of multiple publication and 'salami slicing' (splitting data) is imperative.</P>
<P>Also important is the maintenance of this review in the light of new evidence: we await the publication of the results of the four randomised controlled trials listed in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Keating-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keating 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Pimpalnerkar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pimpalnerkar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webb-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 2000;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Willits-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Willits 2009</LINK>).</P>

Treatment is either by plaster cast immobilisation for a period of 8 weeks or more, or by surgical repair of the tendon followed by a similar period of immobilisation. This study aims to establish which method enables the patient to return to everyday activity with the best functional result in the shortest time, and fewer complications. Those in favour of surgical treatment argue tht there is a lower re-rupture rate with an operative line of management compared with patients treated non-operatively (1.5% and 17% respectively). In addition, calf muscle strength is reported to be weaker (Inglis et al 1976; Jacobs et al 1978) and there is a risk of elongation of the Achilles tendon after conservative treatment (Nystrom and Holmlund 1983). The proponents of non-operative treatment reasons that it avoids an operation and wound complications, and that the results are as good as surgical treatment. The benefits of early mobilisation of repaired forearm flexor tendons has been shown experimentally by improved orientation of collagen fibrils (Peacock 1965), remodelling of the tendon (Viidik 1967) and increased tensile strength (Woo et al 1981). Recent reports of early mobilisation for treatment of acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon have shown promising results (Cetti 1988; Saleh et al 1992; Saw et al 1993). Minimal disruption of the tendon's blood supply by the use of a percutaneous technique might offer the benefits of a surgical repair but with a reduced risk of infection and wound complications (Lagergren and Lindholm 1959). Ma and Griffith (1977) achieved good results without widespread acceptance of this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Research results are not collected by the NRR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Search PubMed for Webb&amp;#160;J (author) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;middle&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project organisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This record is from a regional or national research programme data provider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start Date:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;01/07/1995&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;End Date:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;01/07/1997&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact person:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Jonathon Webb Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust&lt;br&gt;A&amp;amp;E Dept , John Radcliffe Hospital&lt;br&gt;Headington&lt;br&gt;Oxford&lt;br&gt;OX3 9DU&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-07-15 14:37:37 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="OTHER">
