<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-06 10:06:17 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B>
</P>
<P>Which pain-killers are effective at reducing the discomfort experienced with hysterosalpingography?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B>
</P>
<P>Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a test used in investigating infertility in women. HSG involves a dye being introduced into the uterus and the connecting tubes, which enables them to be visualised using an x-ray, allowing the clinician to assess how open the connecting tubes are. This can be a painful procedure. There is disagreement regarding the best form of pain relief during the procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>
</P>
<P>We identified 19 randomised controlled trials that compared a specific drug treatment to a placebo/no treatment. Four trials compared two different drug treatments to establish if one was better. All studies took place in a clinical setting. Age of participants ranged from 18 to 42 years. Studies took place in India, Australia, United Kingdom, United States of America, Turkey, Israel, Netherlands, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, Spain, Brazil, and Belgium (1272 women in total).</P>
<P>We included 15 of these trials in a meta-analysis. The remaining eight trials, while eligible for inclusion, did not have data in a format that could be entered into meta-analysis (seven compared a specific drug to a placebo/no treatment, one compared two different drug treatments). The evidence is current to April 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>:</P>
<P>Topical anaesthetic was associated with a mild reduction in the pain experienced during HSG (low quality evidence). However, it has no effect on the discomfort experienced by participants following the procedure (very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Locally injected anaesthetics, on the other hand, were not associated with any benefit. Only one study investigated this (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>One study directly compared locally injected anaesthetics to topical anaesthetics. This study found that topical anaesthesia was associated with improved pain relief during the procedure (moderate quality evidence)</P>
<P>No oral drug was found to be effective in reducing pain experienced during the procedure. This was true for both opioid (low quality evidence) and non-opioid (low quality evidence) analgesia. One trial however reported that tramadol may be of benefit in reducing the pain experienced more than 30 minutes after the procedure (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the combined results was mainly downgraded for two reasons: 1) studies having methods that may be at risk of bias/inaccuracy; 2) substantially different conclusions between studies that investigate the same drug.</P>
<P>The included studies did not report side effects in large enough numbers to make definitive conclusions regarding the side effects of particular drugs during the procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions:</B>
</P>
<P>Only topical anaesthetics and intravenous opioids were found to be of benefit in reducing pain during the procedure, though the quality of this evidence is low to moderate, and there is no evidence that these are effective at relieving pain following the procedure. There is insufficient evidence for other drug treatments in reducing pain during HSG. There was insufficient evidence to reach any conclusions regarding adverse effects.</P>

</P>
<P>There was evidence that intravenous opioids may improve pain relief during the procedure compared to no treatment (MD &#8722;3.53, 95% CI &#8722;4.29 to &#8722;2.77, 1 study, n = 62, moderate quality evidence)</P>
<P>No studies reported on the effect of intravenous opioid analgesia, when taken prior to the procedure, in reducing pain within 30 minutes and more than 30 minutes after the procedure</P>

<P>There was no evidence of effect for oral non-opioid analgesia in reducing pain during the procedure (MD &#8722;0.13, 95% CI &#8722;0.48 to 0.23, 3 studies, n = 133, I = 61%, low quality evidence), less than 30 minutes after the procedure (MD &#8722;0.30, 95% CI &#8722;1.03 to 0.43, 2 studies, n = 45, I = 97%, very low quality evidence), or more than 30 minutes after the procedure (MD &#8722;0.36, 95% CI &#8722;1.06 to 0.34, 3 studies, n = 133, I = 58%, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions regarding adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Topical anaesthesia versus placebo/no treatment</B>
</P>
<P>There was evidence that topical anaesthetics may reduce pain during the procedure (MD &#8722;0.63, 95% CI &#8722;1.06 to &#8722;0.19, 9 studies, n = 613, I = 66%, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of effect for topical anaesthesia, when applied prior to the procedure, in reducing pain less than 30 minutes after the procedure (MD 0.42, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.86, 5 studies, n = 373, I = 59%, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was evidence of effect for topical anaesthesia, when applied prior to the procedure, in reducing pain more than 30 minutes after the procedure (MD &#8722;1.38, 95% CI -3.44 to &#8722;0.68, 2 studies, n = 166, I = 92%, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions regarding adverse effects.</P>

<P>No studies were included into the analysis of the effect of locally injected anaesthesia, when injected prior to the procedure, in reducing pain more than 30 minutes after the procedure.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions regarding adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Any analgesic versus any other analgesic</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between the groups when oral non-opioid analgesia was compared to opioid analgesia for pain relief during the procedure (MD 1.10, 95% CI &#8722;0.26 to 2.46, 1 study, n = 91, low quality evidence); less than 30 minutes following the procedure (MD &#8722;0.30, 95% CI &#8722;1.00 to 0.40, 1 study, n = 91, low quality evidence); and more than 30 minutes following the procedure (MD &#8722;0.60, 95% CI &#8722;1.56 to 0.36, 1 study, n = 91, low quality evidence). Topical anaesthetics were found to be more effective than paracervical block for pain relief during HSG (MD &#8722;2.73, 95% CI &#8722;3.86 to &#8722;1.60, 1 study, n = 20, moderate quality evidence). This benefit did not extend to within 30 minutes following HSG (MD &#8722;1.03, 95% CI &#8722;2.52 to 0.46, 1 study, n = 20, low quality evidence); or 30 minutes or more after HSG (MD 0.31, 95% CI &#8722;0.87 to 1.49, 1 study, n = 20, low quality evidence).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-07 07:53:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topical anaesthetic applied before the procedure may be associated with effective pain relief during HSG, though the quality of this evidence is low. Intravenous opioids may also be effective in pain relief, though this must be weighed against their side effects and their effects on the recovery time. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy of other analgesics for HSG, or to reach any other conclusions regarding adverse effects.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-25 15:17:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Tubal diseases account for 14% of cases of subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1985</LINK>), and include tubal obstruction, peritubal adhesions secondary to infection, endometriosis and previous surgery. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a reliable indicator of tubal patency, with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommending HSG to screen for tubal occlusion in the absence of co-morbidities (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-guidelines-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE guidelines 2013</LINK>). While it is an integral part of the infertility workup, it can be very painful. This pain peaks at the time of instillation of the contrast media until 5 minutes after the procedure and then starts to decrease rapidly between 5 and 10 minutes after the procedure, so that at 30 minutes, most women classify it as a discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Owens-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1985</LINK>). The pain is due to several factors, including cervical instrumentation, uterine distension, and peritoneal irritation from contrast spill into the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, grasping the cervix with a tenaculum (a type of forceps with a hook), as well as distending the uterus, may release local prostaglandins. These can initiate uterine cramps, which result in delayed pain after HSG. Pain from the cervix and lower portion of the uterus is carried by the pelvic splanchnics (a nerve relating to the viscera), whereas pain sensation from the fundus and body of the uterus (uterine cramps) is conducted via the hypogastric (lower part of the abdomen) nerves to the lower thoracic (area of the chest) segments (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1985</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-14 13:18:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We have investigated the effect of any one type of pharmacological intervention for pain relief during HSG compared with another type or with a placebo.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-03 01:36:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pain experienced during and after HSG can have a negative impact on the woman&#8217;s ability to co-operate with the procedure, thus limiting the usefulness of the investigation, as well as negatively influencing the woman&#8217;s willingness to undertake similar diagnostic studies. Therefore, establishing the most effective analgesia to offer during this procedure is important to minimise these factors.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-24 18:17:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A survey of Obstetric and Gynaecology departments in the United Kingdom reported a wide variation of practice with regards to pain relief in HSG. There appears to be no consensus in terms of if analgesia is considered, which analgesic is used, and when this analgesic is to be administered (personal comm: Ahmad, 2006). This review aims to report the evidence available.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-12 11:21:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We used Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias to assess that risk for each study. We considered the domains of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. We assessed the following for each study: concealed randomisation; allocation concealment; technique of randomisation; time of randomisation (pre- or intra-operatively); number of randomised participants; number of participants not randomised, with explanation; participant exclusion; blinding of participants; blinding of observer; blinding of outcome assessment; documentation of drop-outs; standardisation of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and whether the intention-to-treat analysis was employed. Information was managed within a 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>Four review authors (GA, HO&#8217;F, AH and LB) independently performed all assessments of the risk of bias of trials and extracted data. All discrepancies were resolved by AW. Additional information on trial methodology and trial data was sought from the authors of trials which appear to meet the eligibility criteria but had aspects of methodology that were unclear, or where the data were in a form that was unsuitable for meta-analysis</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-08-07 03:23:11 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. adverse events), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). For continuous data, if all studies reported exactly the same outcomes we calculated mean difference (MD) between treatment groups. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales we planned to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
<P>Any validated pain scale was acceptable for inclusion of a trial into the review. If a study reported a mean pain score on two separate occasions within the same group, the earliest mean pain score was used. This was used instead of the peak mean pain score as pain peaks from the time of distension until five minutes after the procedure, so that at 30 minutes most women classify the pain as a discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Owens-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>When interpreting the results of the comparison of an intervention to a placebo, a negative MD indicates that an intervention is superior to a placebo and a positive MD indicates that a placebo is superior to an intervention, in terms of their ability to reduce levels of pain.</P>
<P>We analysed the data and compared them according to the timing of the pain. The three timing groups were: pain during the procedure; pain within the first 30 minutes of the procedure; and pain more than 30 minutes following the procedure.</P>

<P>The following were addressed.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Multiple observations for the same outcome - validated scores were given preference. In the meta-analysis, a VAS score was preferentially used if reported, as this was the one validated score consistently reported across the studies.</LI>
<LI>If there were multiple intervention groups, we would preferentially combine all relevant experimental intervention groups of the study into a single group, and combine all relevant control intervention groups into a single control group. This was the case for <LINK REF="STD-Stoop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stoop 2010</LINK>, where we combined the metal cannula and balloon cannula groups to form one intervention arm and one placebo arm. If this was not possible, we would instead split the &#8216;shared&#8217; group into two or more groups with smaller sample size, and include two or more (reasonably independent) comparisons.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hacivelioglu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hacivelioglu 2014</LINK> was also not included in the meta-analysis. This was because it was a four-armed trial comparing various forms of pain relief, with no control group. The differences between the forms of pain relief administered between the groups meant we could not justify combining groups to include into the meta-analysis. Furthermore, we decided not to include each pair-wise comparison separately, with shared intervention groups divided out approximately evenly among the comparisons. This is as each group would have needed to be divided by at least 3, which would leave a significant unit of analysis error that would substantially bias the meta-analysis. Therefore, we ultimately decided to exclude this study from the meta-analysis, but to analyse its data in a qualitative manner in the text.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Costello-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Costello 2002</LINK>, it was noted that in the group receiving the intervention (lignocaine), 6 of the 55 women (10.9%) did not take co-intervention (pre-HSG naproxen). However, in the placebo group, only 1 of the 55 women (1.8%) did not take the co-intervention (pre-HSG naproxen). The authors argue that there was no significant difference between groups, as the P value calculated was 0.113. However, this high P value can also be due to the very small numbers of participants in each group, and on direct comparison, a much larger proportion of participants in the intervention group did not take their naproxen when compared to the control group. This, we feel, could in part explain why subjects in the lignocaine group were found to experience more pain at 10 minutes when compared to placebo, and thus could have influenced the conclusions of this report.</P>

<P>On pooled analysis, we found a small benefit with using any form of pain relief versus placebo in reducing pain during HSG, though the quality of this evidence is weak.

<P>On subgroup analysis, we found that topical anaesthetic, when applied prior to HSG, is associated with reduced pain and discomfort during the procedure, though the quality of this evidence is low. Furthermore, on pooled analysis, topical anaesthetics did not improve pain relief during the period up to 30 minutes following the procedure, though the quality of this evidence is very low.</P>
<P>There is no evidence of a difference between oral non-opioid analgesia and placebo/no treatment, either during or following HSG, though the quality of evidence was deemed low.</P>
<P>Locally injected anaesthetic was shown to be of benefit, both during the procedure and within the first 30 minutes following the procedure, though the quality of the evidence was low.</P>
<P>Oral opioid analgesia was only investigated in one study, which found no evidence of a difference during the procedure, but improved pain relief after 30 minutes following the procedure. The quality of this evidence was deemed low. Intravenous opioid analgesia was found to be of benefit during the procedure, though this analysis was limited to one trial. Another trial, which did not report standard deviations, found no benefit with using intravenous opioids compared to placebo.</P>
<P>We found no evidence of a difference when non-opioid analgesia was compared to topical anaesthesia and opioid analgesia, though both comparisons were limited to one study, with the evidence deemed very low quality for both comparisons.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-07 07:14:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the studies included into the meta-analysis and review directly addressed the study question.</P>
<P>This review includes studies from multiple countries, including India, Australia, United Kingdom, United States of America, Turkey, Israel, Netherlands and Belgium. It is possible that the multitude of different settings may lead to differences between study methods in terms of the procedure work-up, and may lead to differences in participants' characteristics and expectations of the procedure. While this could account for a degree of heterogeneity in the analysis, it also improves the external validity of the results. However, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bello-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bello 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Mello-2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Mello 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chauhan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chauhan 2013</LINK>, this report included no other studies from developing countries. While this may reflect the relatively poor access to services and research funding in these countries, it also affects the applicability of our findings to these settings.</P>
<P>All studies recruited women attending for investigation of infertility, and all studies were carried out in the outpatient setting. While there was a variation in the mean age in reported studies (which ranged from 25 to 35 years old in the studies that reported the mean age data), this variation would not be more than would be expected in most clinical settings. Nonetheless, there is evidence that pain experienced during HSG may correlate to age, and thus the variation should be taken into account when interpreting the results.</P>
<P>Studies were inconsistent in their reporting of women's characteristics, with many failing to report factors such as previous pelvic pathology, weight, ethnicity or previous experience of HSG. Indeed, amongst the trials that reported consistent data, considerable variation was encountered between them. For instance, <LINK REF="STD-Karasahin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Karasahin 2009</LINK> report that 27% of their participants were nulliparous, while <LINK REF="STD-Kafali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kafali 2003</LINK> report that 92% of their participants were nulliparous. Therefore, while there may have been significant variation amongst studies, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to how this affects the external validity of this report.</P>
<P>The clinical interventions carried out in this review should be applicable to different settings. However, there are important logistical factors that can affect the external validity of the results. Specifically, a number of studies that investigated oral analgesia required the participant to take the analgesia at a pre-specified time point prior to the procedure (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Owens-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1985</LINK> required women to take aspirin 2 hours prior to HSG). As this is a participant-dependant factor, which relies on participant compliance, it is possible that strict adherence of this time-point outside the research setting may prove difficult. Concerning topical anaesthetics, many trials report a pre-specified amount being applied during the procedure. However, outside of the research setting, there may be more variation between operators in the amount of topical anaesthetic applied, as well as the differing concentrations available. This again can affect the external validity of the results.</P>
<P>Intravenous opioids have also been included in this review, as the studies did fulfil the criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Bello-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bello 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cengiz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cengiz 2006</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Cengiz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cengiz 2006</LINK> had the medication given by a trained anaesthesiologist, and had regular monitoring of observations and end tidal carbon dioxide throughout the procedure. This may not be possible in a number of outpatient gynaecology departments, and thus may affect the external validity of these results.</P>
<P>All included studies reported the outcome in terms of the VAS score. Studies have validated the VAS in a number of clinical settings, and there is strong evidence supporting the external validity of VAS. As the meta-analysis was based on these scores, this would enhance the applicability of the results to clinical practice.</P>
<P>Finally, certain subgroups investigated by the analysis were limited to only one study. Specifically, the meta-analysis for oral opioids versus oral non-opioids, topical anaesthetics versus paracervical block, locally injected anaesthetic versus placebo and intravenous opioids versus placebo were limited to one trial each. This may influence the external validity of these outcomes, as they have only been investigated in one setting.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-12 12:17:30 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>In the meta-analysis, three studies investigated non-opioid analgesics versus placebo for pain experienced during HSG (133 participants: low quality evidence) and at less than 30minutes following HSG (105 participants: very low quality evidence), while 4 studies investigated non-opioid analgesics versus placebo for pain experienced more than 30 minutes following HSG (193 participants: very low quality evidence). All three outcomes in this subgroup had the evidence downgraded because of their risk of bias assessment. Specifically all included studies were unclear on their allocation concealment, and two studies were unclear on their method of blinding. One study was also at high risk of random sequence generation bias.</P>
<P>We also downgraded the quality of evidence due to the significant heterogeneity seen in this subgroup. This was especially substantial for the outcome taken at less than 30 minutes following HSG. This may be because a number of different drugs, with different administration times, and with different mechanisms of action (such as paracetamol and NSAIDs) were pooled together as per the initial protocol. Indeed for analysis 1.3.3, most of the heterogeneity is due to <LINK REF="STD-Elson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elson 2000</LINK> which, unlike the other studies, used paracetamol rather than NSAIDs. There is evidence to suggest that pain during HSG is the result of an inflammatory process, involving prostaglandins, which are released following cervical instrumentation and uterine distension (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1985</LINK>). As such, paracetamol, which has no anti-inflammatory properties, may have less of an effect than NSAIDs, and may explain the inconsistency seen in our results (<LINK REF="STD-Elson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elson 2000</LINK>). Indeed the other two studies from <LINK REF="STD-Owens-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1985</LINK> used different NSAIDs (fenoprofen and aspirin), and the different modes of action between these two drugs may also help explain why one anti-inflammatory preparation was more effective</P>
<P>In total, nine studies in the meta-analysis investigated topical anaesthetics versus placebo for pain during HSG (613 participants: low quality evidence). The quality of evidence was downgraded as three trials showed unclear evidence of random sequence generation, four trials were unclear on the method of allocation concealment, and one trial was unclear on the method of blinding. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Karasahin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Karasahin 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Unlu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Unlu 2015</LINK> were deemed at high risk of bias due to inadequate blinding, and <LINK REF="STD-Costello-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Costello 2002</LINK> was deemed at high risk of bias due to differences between the treatment and the control groups.</P>
<P>Evidence was also downgraded, as we believe that the analysis showed a moderate level of heterogeneity. This was because the analysis had an I of 66%, a significant Chi P value (0.003), and evidence of a moderate amount of variation in the point estimate between different studies. This was despite the fact that, for most studies, there was fairly good overlap with the confidence intervals.</P>
<P>This heterogeneity was primarily due to <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 2004</LINK> which, if removed, resulted in an I = 0%. On analysing the study, there appears to be no specific cause of this heterogeneity, though it may in part be due to all topical anaesthetic interventions being grouped together as per the initial protocol. From analysing the studies, it became apparent that the location of application of topical anaesthesia varied between studies, with some studies applying it to the cervix (<LINK REF="STD-Kalantari-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kalantari 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karasahin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Karasahin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liberty-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Liberty 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unlu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Unlu 2015</LINK>), others applying it to the uterus (<LINK REF="STD-Costello-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Costello 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unlu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Unlu 2015</LINK>), and some studies applying it to both (<LINK REF="STD-Kafali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kafali 2003</LINK>).This may in part account for the level of heterogeneity seen on analysis. This is because, as per our protocol, the earliest pain score during the procedure was taken. For a lot of studies, this involved the beginning parts of the procedure, which involve the most cervical manipulation. Therefore, it would follow that topical application of the anaesthesia to the cervix would have more of an effect than topical application of the anaesthesia to the uterus, which is less involved in mediating pain during the early aspects of the procedure. Therefore, the variation seen may in part be down to variations in the application site of the anaesthesia, and does highlight one of the potential biases of this systematic review as a whole (see below in <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>). It should however be noted that analysing <LINK REF="STD-Costello-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Costello 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Unlu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Unlu 2015</LINK> alone still results in an I = 33%. This again may be in part due to the study authors taking pain scores at different time points during the procedure, as both <LINK REF="STD-Costello-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Costello 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Frishman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Frishman 2004</LINK>, unlike most of the other studies, do not specify at which point during the procedure the pain score was taken (only specifying that the pain score was taken "during the procedure").</P>
<P>Topical anaesthetic versus placebo for pain experienced less than 30 minutes following the procedure was investigated by five studies in the meta-analysis (373 participants: very low quality evidence). Evidence was downgraded as four trials were unclear on allocation concealment, four trials were unclear on selective reporting, and one trial was unclear on blinding. One trial was deemed at high risk of bias due to differences in pretreatment between control and intervention groups. Therefore, we decided to downgrade the evidence due to the unclear effect of bias. The analysis also showed evidence of substantial heterogeneity, with a large variation in the point estimate between studies, I = 59%, Chi P value = 0.05. We were unable to ascertain an obvious reason as to the cause of the heterogeneity, and we therefore downgraded the quality of evidence as a result.</P>
<P>Topical anaesthetic versus placebo for pain experienced more than 30 minutes following the procedure was only investigated by two studies in the meta-analysis (128 participants: low quality). Evidence was downgraded, as one trial was unclear in their methods for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. Furthermore a high level of heterogeneity was noted, with I = 92%, Chi test P = 0.00027, and poor confidence interval and point estimate overlap. No specific reason was identified for this heterogeneity, and thus the evidence was downgraded</P>
<P>Only one study in the meta-analysis investigated oral opioid analgesia versus placebo for pain experienced during HSG (128 women: moderate quality evidence); and at more than 30 minutes following HSG (128 women: moderate quality evidence). Quality of the evidence was downgraded, as both the allocation concealment and blinding of the one trial were unclear. Inconsistency could not be addressed, as there was only one trial.</P>
<P>Only one study in the meta-analysis investigated intravenous opioids versus placebo for pain experienced during HSG (62 participants: moderate quality evidence). The evidence was downgraded as the trial was at unclear risk of bias in the areas of performance, selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias.</P>
<P>Two studies investigated locally injected anaesthesia versus placebo/no treatment. We downgraded evidence as one trial investigating this outcome was at high risk of performance and detection bias, and was at unclear risk of allocation bias. The other trial was high risk of performance and detection bias, and unclear risk for selection and attrition bias. As there was a serious risk of overall bias, we downgraded the overall evidence to low quality.</P>
<P>Only one study in the meta-analysis investigated topical anaesthetic versus paracervical block for pain experienced during HSG (20 participants: moderate quality evidence); less than 30 minutes post HSG (20 participants: moderate quality evidence); and more than 30 minutes post HSG (20 participants: moderate quality evidence). Quality of the evidence was downgraded as this study had unclear sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. Inconsistency could not be addressed, as there was only one trial.</P>
<P>Only one study in the meta-analysis investigated oral opioid analgesia versus oral non-opioid analgesia for pain experienced during HSG (91 participants: very low quality evidence); less than 30 minutes post HSG (91 participants: very low quality evidence); and more than 30 minutes post HSG (91 participants: very low quality evidence). This trial was downgraded as it was deemed at high risk with regards to blinding. It was also deemed high risk due to the large numbers of participants in the treatment group who may not have received treatment (see 'Risk of bias' table). Furthermore, it was also considered to be at high risk of selective reporting, which led us to categorise the risk to quality as very serious. Inconsistency could not be addressed, as there was only one trial.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-08-04 04:39:52 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An important limitation to our study was that we had to pool the results of pain scores following HSG into either those taken between 5 and 29 minutes following HSG, or those more than 30 minutes post HSG, as the included studies were not consistent in the time points they measured. The rationale for picking these times is that pain during HSG peaks between the time of instillation of the contrast medium until 5 minutes after the procedure and then decreases rapidly thereafter, so that at 30 minutes most women classify it as a discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Owens-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1985</LINK>). Therefore, by splitting the results into these three distinct groups, we aimed to cover a broader spectrum of pain experienced by women undergoing HSG, and investigate if any analgesia showed particular benefit at any of these specific stages.</P>
<P>However, by pooling the analysis, we may have combined results that were taken at different time points, which increases the risk of heterogeneity in our results. Furthermore, by taking the earliest pain score in each of these three categories, we cannot discount the possibility that, in some studies, certain analgesics may have shown benefit at specific time points that were not included in the meta-analysis. A good example of this is in <LINK REF="STD-Unlu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Unlu 2015</LINK>, which only found benefit for topical anaesthetic during dye instillation, despite the fact that earlier pain scores during the procedure did not show any benefit. While we considered analysing different time points during the procedure, it was found that included trials were not consistent in their reporting of pain scores at different points during the procedure. Therefore, as per the initial review protocol, we included only the earliest pain scores in each of the categories, with the understanding that this may have introduced a level of bias in the review process.</P>
<P>Another of the inherent problems associated with our meta-analysis is that different authors use different methods of measuring pain, and measure pain at different time points. As such, in an attempt to standardise the results, we have focused our meta-analysis on papers that use validated numerical scores of pain (e.g. the VAS score), as they are easier to incorporate into an analysis, and are widely used in the literature. However, this means that we would not be able to include some results into the meta-analysis that use either a descriptive score, or non-validated scoring system. Arguably, this may lead to potential bias in the meta-analysis, as numerical scores of pain such as the VAS can be inappropriate in certain populations, such as the illiterate (<LINK REF="REF-Hawker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawker 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, it is also important to note that we have decided to present the results of the meta-analysis by using the random-effects model. The reason for this is because we argue that the fixed-effect model assumes that the studies included in the analysis are functionally identical. However, on analysis of the studies, we have found differences for many of the outcomes in terms of treatment administration times, treatment doses and measured outcome times. Furthermore, while the population characteristics were not detailed consistently across studies, the numerous different clinical settings in different countries meant that there were important differences between studies. Therefore, we decided to use the random-effects model, which can take into account these differences, as well as be more generalised to other clinical settings.</P>

<P>In summary, our meta-analysis has shown that, of the analgesics investigated, only topical anaesthetics demonstrated effective pain relief during HSG, though it is not effective at relieving pain following the procedure. Otherwise, there is insufficient evidence regarding the other forms of pharmacological pain relief in HSG.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-04 04:41:14 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further high quality, well-powered trials should be undertaken investigating the efficacy of potent NSAIDs and opioid analgesia during HSG. Research is also needed in investigating the effect of combining different analgesia classes on HSG-related pain. Usable data regarding the adverse effects of pain relief also need to be consistently reported across future studies. Likewise, high quality, well-powered trials should be undertaken to further establish the efficacy of topical anaesthesia, with differing doses of anaesthesia, as well as differing time periods of application prior to HSG.</P>

Furthermore, of the 40% of women in group B confirmed to have taken the naproxen, there was no mention of the approximate timeframe that the drug was reported to have been taken in, despite the fact that these data were stated as recorded in the methods. No mention of any drop-outs.</P>

<P>Quote: "Both groups were similar in...number of patients correctly taking their pre-HSG naproxen sodium tablets".</P>
<P>Comment: in the lignocaine group, 6 of the 55 participants (10.9%) did not take pre-HSG naproxen, while in the placebo group, only 1 of the 55 women (1.8%) did not take their pre-proceedure naproxen. The authors argue that there was no significant difference between groups, as the P value calculated was 0.113. However, this high P value can also be due to the very small numbers of participants in each group and, on direct comparison, a much larger proportion of participants in the intervention group did not take their naproxen when compared to the control group. This, we feel, could in part explain why subjects in the lignocaine group were found to experience more pain at 10 minutes when compared to placebo, and thus could have influenced the conclusions of this report.</P>
