<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is treatment involving a team of therapists from several different clinical professions helpful for people with long-term back pain?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Low back pain (LBP) is a condition that causes a great deal of pain and suffering across the world and also accounts for large costs to society due to healthcare spending and missed work. Previous research has shown that LBP that has persisted for several months or years is often associated with psychological and social problems. Multidisciplinary treatments target physical as well as psychological and social aspects of LBP and involve a team of healthcare providers with different professional backgrounds and training.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We collected all the published studies up to February 2014; there were 41 studies (with 6858 participants) that compared multidisciplinary treatment to other treatments. Most studies compared a multidisciplinary treatment to usual care (such as care by a general practitioner) or to treatments that only addressed physical factors (such as exercise or physiotherapy). All the people in the studies had LBP for more than three months and most had received some other sort of treatment previously.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary treatment results in larger improvements in pain and daily function than usual care or treatments aimed only at physical factors. The difference was not very large, about 1 point on a 10 point scale for pain, but this may be important for people whose symptoms have not responded to other treatments. There was also moderate evidence that multidisciplinary treatment doubled the likelihood that people were able to work in the next 6 to 12 months compared to treatments aimed at physical factors.</P>
<P>While these programs seem to be more effective than alternatives, the effects needs to be balanced with their costs in terms of money, resources and time. Multidisciplinary treatment programs are often quite intensive and expensive, so they are probably most appropriate for people with quite severe or complex problems.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:18:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for considerable personal suffering worldwide. Those with persistent disabling symptoms also contribute to substantial costs to society via healthcare expenditure and reduced work productivity. While there are many treatment options, none are universally endorsed. The idea that chronic LBP is a condition best understood with reference to an interaction of physical, psychological and social influences, the 'biopsychosocial model', has received increasing acceptance. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target factors from the different domains, administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:18:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the evidence on the effectiveness of MBR for patients with chronic LBP. The focus was on comparisons with usual care and with physical treatments measuring outcomes of pain, disability and work status, particularly in the long term.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:18:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases in January and March 2014 together with carrying out handsearches of the reference lists of included and related studies, forward citation tracking of included studies and screening of studies excluded in the previous version of this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-08-26 08:55:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies identified in the searches were screened independently by two review authors; disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included adults with non-specific LBP of longer than 12 weeks duration; the index intervention targeted at least two of physical, psychological and social or work-related factors; and the index intervention was delivered by clinicians from at least two different professional backgrounds.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 08:56:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors extracted and checked information to describe the included studies, assessed risk of bias and performed the analyses. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to describe the methodological quality. The primary outcomes were pain, disability and work status, divided into the short, medium and long term. Secondary outcomes were psychological functioning (for example depression, anxiety, catastrophising), healthcare service utilisation, quality of life and adverse events. We categorised the control interventions as usual care, physical treatment, surgery, or wait list for surgery in separate meta-analyses. The first two comparisons formed our primary focus. We performed meta-analyses using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE method. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of the methodological quality, and subgroup analyses to investigate the influence of baseline symptom severity and intervention intensity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-27 01:01:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From 6168 studies identified in the searches, 41 RCTs with a total of 6858 participants were included. Methodological quality ratings ranged from 1 to 9 out 12, and 13 of the 41 included studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Pooled estimates from 16 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR is more effective than usual care in reducing pain and disability, with standardised mean differences (SMDs) in the long term of 0.21 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.37) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.4) respectively. The range across all time points equated to approximately 0.5 to 1.4 units on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale for pain and 1.4 to 2.5 points on the Roland Morris disability scale (0 to 24). There was moderate to low quality evidence of no difference on work outcomes (odds ratio (OR) at long term 1.04, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.47). Pooled estimates from 19 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR was more effective than physical treatment for pain and disability with SMDs in the long term of 0.51 (95% CI -0.01 to 1.04) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.19) respectively. Across all time points this translated to approximately 0.6 to 1.2 units on the pain scale and 1.2 to 4.0 points on the Roland Morris scale. There was moderate to low quality evidence of an effect on work outcomes (OR at long term 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.53). There was insufficient evidence to assess whether MBR interventions were associated with more adverse events than usual care or physical interventions.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that the pooled estimates were unduly influenced by the results from low quality studies. Subgroup analyses were inconclusive regarding the influence of baseline symptom severity and intervention intensity.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-27 01:17:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with chronic LBP receiving MBR are likely to experience less pain and disability than those receiving usual care or a physical treatment. MBR also has a positive influence on work status compared to physical treatment. Effects are of a modest magnitude and should be balanced against the time and resource requirements of MBR programs. More intensive interventions were not responsible for effects that were substantially different to those of less intensive interventions. While we were not able to determine if symptom intensity at presentation influenced the likelihood of success, it seems appropriate that only those people with indicators of significant psychosocial impact are referred to MBR.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:18:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low back pain (LBP) and the associated disability are responsible for a significant personal burden globally. Recent epidemiological research suggests LBP is the leading cause of years lived with disability (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). There is also a substantial societal burden, with costs attributable to healthcare services and to loss of work productivity running into the billions of dollars annually in many western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Maetzal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzal 2002</LINK>). Lifetime prevalence rates are high, approaching 70% to 80% according to some studies, and a significant proportion of patients develop chronic symptoms lasting three months or more (<LINK REF="REF-Henschke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henschke 2008</LINK>). Chronic LBP results in ongoing personal suffering for the involved individuals and most of the substantial economic costs associated with the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Lambeek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambeek 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maetzal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzal 2002</LINK>). The focus of this review was on patients with chronic LBP.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:18:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the large volume of clinical research focused on identifying effective treatments for chronic LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Artus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Machado-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machado 2009</LINK>) optimal management remains a source of contention (<LINK REF="REF-Koes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 2010</LINK>). One treatment approach is founded on the conceptualisation of LBP as a biopsychosocial problem (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2004</LINK>). This approach is supported by the observation that LBP, particularly at the chronic stage, is characterised by a combination of physical, psychological and social dysfunctions (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2009</LINK>). Further, it appears that psychological and social factors may play a role in the development and maintenance of pain and disability (<LINK REF="REF-den-Hollander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">den Hollander 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholas 2011</LINK>). This has led to the design of interventions to address multiple factors, typically involving a combination of physical, psychological and educational components and often delivered by a team of clinicians with different skills (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeets-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeets 2006</LINK>). Recent decades have seen an increase in research into a multidisciplinary approach due to wider acceptance of the biopsychosocial model (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2011</LINK>), the ineffectiveness of monotherapies (<LINK REF="REF-Artus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artus 2010</LINK>), and promising reports from clinical practice. Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) may be delivered in multidisciplinary pain clinics, rehabilitation centres or outpatient settings.</P>
<P>Recent Cochrane reviews have addressed behavioural treatment for chronic LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Henschke-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henschke 2011</LINK>), physical conditioning programs for improving work outcomes in workers with back pain<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Schaafsma-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaafsma 2013</LINK>), and individual patient education for LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Engers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engers 2008</LINK>). These reviews generally report small effects that arise from single-discipline interventions in the population of interest. <LINK REF="REF-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karjalainen 2003</LINK> investigated the effects of multidisciplinary treatments on subacute back pain, however they identified only two studies that met their inclusion criteria. The previous version of this Cochrane review was published in 2001, with searches performed up to 1998. It has subsequently been withdrawn by The Cochrane Collaboration due to being out of date (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:18:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The theoretical basis of the intervention comes from the biopsychosocial model (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2004</LINK>). According to the theory, chronic LBP involves impairments of physical, psychological and social functioning, and effective treatment requires intervention that specifically addresses these problems. Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation includes elements aimed at improving back-related physical dysfunction as well as addressing psychological issues or targeting social or work-related behaviours, or both. There is some evidence from systematic reviews to suggest that these interventions may have a positive effect on work participation outcomes in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Norlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Geen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Geen 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-26 08:58:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although promising, it is notable that MBR often involves investment of substantial staffing and financial resources by the heathcare system. The indirect costs burden employers, insurance companies and patients as well. The value of MBR has often been questioned because data are lacking regarding its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Smeets-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeets 2009</LINK>). While two meta-analyses on the effectiveness of MBR have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Cutler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1992</LINK>), they were completed more than 20 years ago and are now clearly out of date. More recently performed reviews have not included a quantitative synthesis of the evidence. The most recent Cochrane review that directly assessed the effectiveness of MBR on patients with chronic LBP was published in 2001, but this review was withdrawn in 2006 because the literature search was out of date (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK>). Collection and synthesis of the evidence relevant to the effectiveness of MBR for chronic LBP was overdue.</P>

<P>RCTs that investigated male or female participants, or both, with non-specific chronic LBP and who were older than 18 years of age were included. Chronic LBP was defined as back pain that had persisted for 12 weeks or more. If a RCT recruited LBP patients with a mixed duration of symptoms (that is it also included patients with &lt; 12 weeks duration), it was included if data for the chronic LBP patients were presented separately or if greater than 75% of participants had symptoms for more than 12 weeks. Trials that recruited patients with spinal pain at any level were included if &gt; 75% of participants had LBP. Trials including participants with clearly diagnosed radiculopathy or only patients who had back surgery in the previous 12 months were excluded. Trials were also excluded if they included participants with specific LBP caused by infection, neoplasm, metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory articular conditions (for example ankylosing spondylitis), spinal stenosis or fracture. Diagnoses such as disc degeneration or bulging discs, facet joint dysfunction and sacroiliac joint pain were included in the review.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 08:59:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>MBR was defined as an intervention that involves a physical component (for example an exercise program) and at least one other element from the biopsychosocial model, that is psychological or social and occupational. The intervention program had to have been delivered by clinicians from different disciplines, that is a minimum of two healthcare professionals from different professional backgrounds had to be involved in the intervention delivery. The different components of the intervention had to be offered as an integrated program involving communication between the providers responsible for the different components. We expected clinicians would include physicians, psychologists, physiotherapists, social workers, occupational therapists and exercise therapists.</P>

We chose to align our conceptualisation of multidisciplinary treatment with a biopsychosocial model of LBP and included studies with interventions that addressed at least two parts of the model (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravenek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravenek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Geen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Geen 2007</LINK>). While there is some overlap (in terms of included studies) with the Cochrane review of behavioural treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Henschke-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henschke 2011</LINK>), the review of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Schaafsma-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaafsma 2013</LINK>), and the review of back schools (<LINK REF="REF-Heymans-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymans 2010</LINK>), we expected that the total set of included trials would be substantially different.</P>
<P>Any type of control intervention was included, but the following comparisons were evaluated separately. Comparisons 1 and 2 represent the main focus of this review.</P>

<LI>MBR versus usual care.</LI>
<LI>MBR versus physical treatment.</LI>
<LI>MBR versus surgery.</LI>

<P>Where there was more than one MBR program assessed against a non-MBR control in the same trial, the more intensive program was used in the comparison. Studies that compared different MBR programs with each other were included and described but between group differences were not synthesised.</P>

<P>Sixteen studies reported on the effect of a MBR intervention versus usual care. More details regarding the content of the interventions are provided in the individual study descriptions (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Between six and nine studies provided data for pain outcomes at each time point (total n = 740 to 879), six to nine studies for disability outcomes (total n = 722 to 939) and two to seven for work outcomes (total n = 373 to 1360).</P>
<P>For pain, point estimates for the pooled between group differences ranged from 0.21 to 0.60 (SMD) in the short, medium and long term (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>); in all cases the 95% CIs did not cross zero, indicating a statistically significant effect in favour of MBR over usual care. For disability, estimates ranged from 0.23 to 0.43 (SMD) and were all significant in favour of MBR (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>). The pooled effects on work outcomes ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 (OR) and were not statistically significant at any time point (<LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-15" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 15</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects on pain and disability translated to approximately 0.5 to 1.4 points on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) and 1.4 to 2.5 points on a 0 to 24 Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. The lower end of the estimate was reported for long-term outcomes and the upper end for short and medium-term outcomes.</P>
<P>The included studies provided low quality evidence that MBR was more effective than usual care on pain in the short and medium term, and moderate quality evidence for the effect in the long term. The quality of evidence for the effect on disability was moderate at all time points. The quality of evidence for no effect on work outcomes was low in the short and medium term and moderate in the long term. The quality of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias for all outcomes and further downgraded for inconsistency for some outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Pooled estimates should be considered in the light of significant statistical heterogeneity amongst the effect sizes of the included studies; in six (of the nine) instances the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was in excess of the 'moderate' threshold of 30%, in three instances it was above the 'substantial' threshold of 60%.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>In general, the pooled effect sizes from the high quality studies were of similar magnitude to those from all included studies, and this was the case regardless of how high quality was defined. However, few studies met the high quality criteria, which resulted in larger CIs around the estimates and meant that some estimates that were significant in the complete analysis were no longer significant in the sensitivity analysis. Overall, inclusion of low quality studies in the meta analyses did not appear to result in a bias towards overestimation of the effect of MBR versus usual care.</P>

<P>A second subgroup analysis was performed on intervention intensity. In most cases the effect estimates from high and low intensity interventions were quite similar and there was substantial overlap of CIs. There was no pattern of smaller or larger effects for either intervention category.

<P>Three studies reported on QoL (Short Form (SF)-36) outcomes in the short and medium term that could be used to calculate pooled effect sizes. Precision was low but these analyses suggested an effect on the SF-36 mental components subscale (MD in the short term of 15.25, in the medium term of 7.59) in favour of MBR (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>), but no effect on the physical components subscale (MD in the short term of 13.45, in the medium term of 7.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). Pooled estimates of effect on psychological outcomes showed a statistically significant effect in favour of MBR on catastrophising in the short term (SMD 0.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) and long term (SMD 0.40) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>) and an effect on fear avoidance at the long (SMD of 0.29) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>), but not the short term (SMD of 0.69) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). The only study that mentioned adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Lambeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lambeek 2010</LINK>) reported none in the MBR group, it was unclear whether adverse events in the usual care group were recorded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">MBR versus physical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Nineteen studies reported on the effect of an MBR intervention versus physical treatment; more details regarding the content of the interventions are provided in the individual study descriptions (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Between 9 and 12 studies provided data for the pain outcomes at each time point (total n = 531 to 1661), 8 to 13 studies for disability outcomes (total n = 511 to 1878) and 3 to 8 for work outcomes (total n = 221 to 1006).</P>
<P>For pain, pooled estimates were in favour of MBR and ranged from 0.28 to 0.51 (SMD) with a statistically significant effect in the short and medium term (<LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-17" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 17</LINK>) but not at long term (<LINK REF="FIG-18" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 18</LINK>). For disability, effects ranged from 0.21 to 0.68 (SMD) in favour of MBR; they were significant for the short and long term (<LINK REF="FIG-19" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 19</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-21" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 21</LINK>) but not for medium term (<LINK REF="FIG-20" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 20</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooled effect sizes on pain and disability in the short and long term were heavily influenced by one low risk of bias study that reported a very large effect, three to five times the size of the effects reported by the other studies (SMD 1.99 to 5.32) (<LINK REF="STD-Monticone-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Monticone 2013</LINK>). Inclusion of this study introduced substantial heterogeneity into the meta-analyses. Removal from the pooled analyses reduced the I<SUP>2</SUP> values substantially, from 81% to 92% to 0% to 49% for pain, and from 88% to 94% to 60% to 61% for disability. If this study was removed from the meta-analyses, the pooled effect estimates for pain ranged from 0.14 to 0.28 (SMD) and were statistically significant in the short and medium term but not long term, and for disability the estimates ranged from 0.18 to 0.21 (SMD) and they were statistically significant in the short but not medium or long term.</P>
<P>For work outcomes, the between group differences at short term were not significant (<LINK REF="FIG-22" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 22</LINK>) but there were significant ORs of 1.87 to 2.14 in favour of MBR for the medium and long term (<LINK REF="FIG-23" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 23</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-24" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 24</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects on pain and disability translated to approximately 0.6 to 1.2 points on a 0 to 10 NRS and 1.2 to 4.0 points on a 0 to 24 Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. The upper end of the estimates was reported for the outcomes at long term. Regarding work outcomes, the estimates indicated that people receiving a MBR intervention had approximately twice the odds of those receiving a purely physical treatment of being at work six and 12 months after the intervention.</P>
<P>The included studies provided low quality evidence that MBR was more effective than physical treatment on pain and disability in the short and long term, and moderate quality evidence for the effect in the medium term. For work outcomes, there was low quality evidence of no effect at short term, low quality evidence of a positive effect at medium term, and moderate quality evidence of an effect at long term (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Pooled estimates should be considered in the light of significant statistical heterogeneity amongst the effect sizes of the included studies. For all six pain and disability comparisons the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was in excess of the 'moderate' threshold of 30%, and in four instances it was above the 'substantial' threshold of 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Removal of the outlier study from the analyses generally reduced inconsistency from substantial to moderate levels. Statistical heterogeneity was minor for work outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>For pain and disability outcomes the effect sizes for the short and long-term analyses from the high quality studies were comparable to those from the complete analyses. In many cases, however, the estimate was no longer statistically significant, likely because of the reduced precision due to fewer included studies. For pain and disability in the medium term, the estimates were substantially lower for the first sensitivity analysis but comparable for the second as compared to the complete analyses. In all cases, both the sensitivity analyses and the complete analysis effect estimates were non-significant. For work outcomes at short and medium term, sensitivity analyses had only one or two studies included, making interpretation difficult. For long-term work outcomes, estimates from the high quality studies were very similar to those from the complete analyses. Overall, inclusion of low quality studies in the meta-analysis did not appear to result in a bias towards overestimation of the effect of MBR versus physical treatment.</P>

<P>The participants in two studies were categorised as having high baseline symptom intensity according to our criteria. One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Monticone-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Monticone 2013</LINK>) reported a very large effect in favour of MBR, three to five times the size of the effects reported by other studies in the comparison. Due to the influence of this study, the estimates of effect for high baseline symptom intensity were substantially larger than those for low intensity. Given these circumstances, the influence of baseline symptom intensity on the effect of MBR versus physical rehabilitation was unclear.</P>
<P>The low intensity interventions had substantially larger effect estimates for pain and disability at all time points, although only one estimate (for pain at short term) was statistically significant; there was substantial overlap of CIs around the estimates for the two intervention types. No low intensity intervention studies reported work outcomes, hence the influence of this variable could not be assessed. The influence of intervention intensity on the effect of MBR versus physical rehabilitation was unclear (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.12</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.14</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.16</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.18</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-27 01:14:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We set out to conduct an updated review on the impact of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on people with chronic low back pain (LBP). We found 31 recently published randomised clinical trials which added to the 10 included in the previous review to form a substantial evidence base, with data on close to 7000 people. Overall we found that when compared with usual care, MBR decreased pain and disability to a moderate degree but had little to no effect on work outcomes. When compared with physical rehabilitation, MBR showed moderate effects on pain, disability and work outcomes. Although the quality of the evidence was moderate or low depending on the comparison, the overall size of the effects of MBR was quite consistent. They translate to an average difference in pain of about 1 to 2 points on a 10-point scale, and an average difference in disability of 2 to 4 points on the 24-point Roland Morris questionnaire. The improvement of work outcomes with MBR when compared to physical rehabilitation translates to about double the odds of being at work 12 months later. It would seem unlikely that conducting further RCTs will substantially change our view of the mean effect that can be expected from MBR programs.</P>
<P>Several factors need to be taken into account when interpreting our findings to formulate recommendations regarding clinical implementation. The resources and costs associated with delivering MBR programs should be considered and weighed against those of usual care or physical training regimens. For example, MBR in 15 of the included studies required more than 100 face-to-face hours of training. Cost-effectiveness data were not extracted as part of this review. The proportion of people that experienced a clinically relevant improvement was not typically reported in the RCTs and did not form a part of this review; as such we cannot be sure the extent to which the between group difference reflects an important change on behalf of the participants. On the other hand, the people referred to these programs had long-standing symptoms which had not responded to previous treatments. As a longer duration of symptoms is an indicator of poor prognosis, a modest improvement in symptom severity compared to another treatment may be significant for this population.</P>
<P>For our main comparisons, pooled effects do not appear to have been overestimated due to inclusion of low quality studies. The influence of baseline symptom intensity on the effectiveness of MBR is unclear because the subgroup analyses were hampered by the small numbers of studies that included samples with symptom intensity that met our a priori threshold. Samples recruited to the included studies typically reported moderate levels of pain intensity (4 to 6 points on the NRS) and disability (8 to 12 points on the Roland Morris Questionnaire). When we divided the included studies according to the hours of face-to-face intervention we did not find a consistent pattern in favour of either high or low intensity interventions.</P>
<P>The inconsistent nature of data collection and reporting made drawing conclusions regarding the secondary outcomes of quality of life, healthcare utilisation and adverse events difficult. Comparable estimates for these outcomes were reported by too few studies to estimate the effect of MBR. MBR did not appear to have any additional significant effect on symptoms of depression compared to physical rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Only two and four RCTs, respectively, were included in comparisons of MBR with surgery or waiting list controls. From each comparison a pooled estimate was generated for pain and disability at one time point. There was low quality evidence of no significant difference between MBR and surgery. The effects in favour of MBR versus waiting list controls were of moderate size, but the quality of the evidence was very low to low. While 12 studies included a comparison of one MBR intervention versus another, we did not perform a synthesis of these data. Synthesis was not undertaken as it does not directly inform decisions as to whether MBR or some other intervention should be administered in this patient group.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:04:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Work outcomes and healthcare utilisation are key considerations for assessing the effects of MBR in this population, since they are primary determinants of the societal burden of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Maetzal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzal 2002</LINK>). Many of the included studies did not report these outcomes, and when reported they were measured in different ways. The lack of standardisation of measurement in these areas makes quantitative synthesis of the body of evidence problematic. For example, in the MBR versus physical treatment comparison 13 of the 19 studies reported a work-related outcome measure yet only three, three and eight studies (short, medium, long term) could be included in the meta-analyses. The fact that these data were not reported in a comparable manner limits our ability to estimate the true effect of MBR for this critical outcome.</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis that investigated the influence of high baseline symptom intensity proved inconclusive, largely because so few studies recruited a sample with high enough intensity. The threshold we chose to indicate high intensity (greater than 60% of the maximum possible score on a pain and a disability measure) is admittedly arbitrary, but it is surprising that only three of the 41 included studies met this criterion. While there is evidence that higher symptom severity at presentation is a prognostic indicator of poor outcome following MBR (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Hulst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Hulst 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Hooff-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Hooff 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verkerk-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verkerk 2013</LINK>), direct evidence that it is a modifier of the effect of MBR is lacking. It could be argued that only those with severe physical symptoms and psychological dysfunction are likely to require, and therefore preferentially benefit from, a comprehensive MBR program. Matching of a more comprehensive and complex intervention with more clinically complex patients makes intuitive sense, and this is supported by recent evidence from the primary care setting (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2011</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:04:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only 32% of the included studies met our threshold for low risk of bias (fulfilling at least six items from the CBRG risk of bias tool) and not surprisingly all meta-analyses included studies with high risk of bias. We applied a stringent rule that inclusion of any (one or more) studies at high risk of bias in a meta-analysis meant downgrading the quality of the evidence by one level within the GRADE system. Such decisions involve a degree of subjective judgement and a more relaxed interpretation of the risk of bias may have resulted in the conclusion that the quality of the evidence in support of the effectiveness of MBR was stronger. To explore this issue we conducted sensitivity analyses. Although not conclusive, the sensitivity analyses did not indicate that inclusion of lower quality studies resulted in overestimation of the effect. This, along with the consistency of the size of the pooled effects on pain and disability, gives confidence that the reported estimates for the primary outcomes are robust. Quality of evidence was also commonly downgraded for inconsistency, this was particularly evident when one outlying study was included in the meta analyses. Exclusion of this study resulted in more consistent and precise pooled estimates for pain and disability across the time points in the MBR versus physical treatment comparison, and provides further evidence that the estimates are robust.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:05:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes MBR. The authors have chosen a definition based on their interpretation of the biopsychosocial model and reflective of the different expertise within the various clinical professions. Presumably it is possible that selection of a different definition could result in inclusion of different studies and hence different effect estimates.</P>
<P>The MBR interventions evaluated in the included studies differed from each other in a number of ways. There were differences in the number of face-to-face sessions and the intensity of the treatment; differences in the settings; differences in the balance of the interventions in terms of focus on physical, psychological and social factors; and differences in the backgrounds of the clinicians that administered the interventions. This clinical heterogeneity is likely due to varying conceptualisations of MBR and also to uncertainty regarding the pathological cause of non-specific LBP. Further heterogeneity is also introduced by differences in the control interventions. By using a random-effects model for generating the pooled estimates and incorporating the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic into the evidence quality assessment we have attempted to account for this heterogeneity.</P>
<P>While most studies measured pain intensity in a similar manner, there was great variability in the measures used for other domains. Despite the efforts of initiatives such as COMET (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2012</LINK>) and IMMPACT (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2005</LINK>), the findings indicate that there is little consensus on the choice of measurement instruments. This renders meaningful synthesis of the body of evidence difficult and may also introduce bias as decisions must be made regarding which outcome measures should be included in the pooled effect estimates. In addition, the lack of a core outcome measurement set increases the chances of selective reporting of results of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2012</LINK>). Only one study in this review met the criterion for absence of reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Tavafian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tavafian 2011</LINK>). It is to be hoped that current efforts to increase the registration of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2012</LINK>) and publication of detailed protocols will improve this situation in the future.</P>
<P>The influence of publication bias on the results is difficult to assess due to the number of studies contributing to each pooled estimate. Only three estimates included the minimum 10 studies recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration for formal assessment of publication bias. The funnel plots for these estimates indicate the possibility of small study bias, a possibility also reported in the review conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Norlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norlund 2009</LINK>.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK> reviewed the literature up to 1998 and found that intensive MBR programs had important effects on disability outcomes and small effects on pain. Evidence regarding work outcomes was equivocal. A 'levels of evidence' synthesis performed by <LINK REF="REF-van-Geen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Geen 2007</LINK> reported positive effects on work participation but not on pain or disability; their study performed searches up until 2003 and included 10 studies, of which seven are in the current review. <LINK REF="REF-Ravenek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravenek 2010</LINK> included 12 studies from 1998 onwards, of which seven were common to this review, and the authors reported conflicting evidence from low quality studies on work outcomes, no effect on pain, and no effect on function. <LINK REF="REF-Norlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norlund 2009</LINK> conducted a systematic review of studies involving people with subacute or chronic LBP and included three studies with chronic LBP, all are in this review. Their meta-analysis showed no effect on return to work for MBR interventions in the chronic LBP studies. It is somewhat surprising that the present review showed no impact of MBR on work outcomes when compared to usual care but a moderate impact when compared to physical treatment. One possibility is that studies comparing MBR to usual care included populations with less severe occupational impairment (thus harder to show an impact). Another possibility is that physical treatment when not paired with concomitant psychological or social interventions may promote a sick role and interfere with attainment of occupational goals.</P>
<P>Few included studies involved an explicitly designed and focused workplace intervention, an issue also identified by <LINK REF="REF-Ravenek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravenek 2010</LINK>. They also observed that occupational therapists were rarely involved in multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions despite the fact that improvement of work-related outcomes is an often stated goal. They and others (<LINK REF="STD-Ektor_x002d_Andersen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ektor-Andersen 2008</LINK>) also pointed out the need for a greater degree of cooperation between workers, employers and insurers to facilitate these outcomes.</P>
<P>No clear conclusions can be drawn regarding whether the intensity of the intervention had an influence on the size of the treatment effect. While the previous version of this review suggested that this factor may be important, a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Waterschoot-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterschoot 2014</LINK>) was inconclusive and found that dose factors could not be disentangled from content factors when determining their influence on the effect size. Individual RCTs conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Rose-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Skouen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Skouen 2002</LINK> reported no substantial differences in effect between multidisciplinary programs of differing intensity. At this point in time it is unclear how much face-to-face time is optimal for MBR interventions. This is a critical question given the role of face-to-face time in driving the cost of MBR.</P>

<P>Choosing an MBR intervention over usual care or a physical treatment program for chronic low back pain is likely to result in a positive effect on pain and disability outcomes. It is also likely that MBR will have a beneficial effect on work outcomes compared to physical treatment. However, given the moderate size of these effects and the potentially high cost of an intensive intervention, in terms of both the monetary and time burden, the decision to refer to MBR requires some consideration. While our subgroup analyses were inconclusive regarding the influence of higher or lower symptom intensity at baseline, it would appear there is little to gain by referring those without substantial physical and psychosocial impacts of their condition to such an intervention. Clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Dagenais-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagenais 2010</LINK>) commonly recommend assessment and treatment of physical and psychosocial factors and referral to appropriately trained clinicians for management of these factors where present. This recommendation would seem more appropriate than a recommendation of MBR simply based on chronicity of symptoms.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-26 09:05:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence regarding the primary outcomes is at best moderate, although consistent in terms of effect size. Despite this, the volume of evidence is substantial and conducting further, similar studies is unlikely to greatly change the estimate of the effectiveness of MBR versus usual care or physical treatment. This being the case, it is important to consider whether the effect is clinically worthwhile. The ideal methods for determining whether an effect is clinically worthwhile are far from settled (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2012</LINK>) but the point has been made that such an estimation needs to take the cost of the intervention into account. In this case costs include not only those of the intervention in terms of time, inconvenience and money but also costs of other healthcare utilisation (for example medications, visits to healthcare providers) and costs of productivity losses due to low back pain, as compared to those associated with other options.</P>
<P>The results of this review could be said to mirror those of others in the low back pain field in that small effects are observed between the index and control interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hayden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henschke-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henschke 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubinstein-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubinstein 2011</LINK>). This situation is largely due to the fact that the pathology underlying non-specific low back pain is, at best, unclear. Given that this is the case, it is unsurprising that the mechanism of effect of the different intervention options is also unknown. Studies that investigate the mechanism of effect of different treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Mansell-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansell 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeets-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeets 2006</LINK>) and investigate the effectiveness of treatments in subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hancock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2010</LINK>) of patients have the potential to improve our understanding of the condition.</P>
<P>Recent studies that have conducted cost-effectiveness analyses of MBR for chronic pain have produced conflicting results. <LINK REF="STD-Lambeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lambeek 2010</LINK> found that their MBR program was cost-effective compared to usual care in the Netherlands; <LINK REF="REF-Smeets-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeets 2009</LINK> reported that while graded activity plus problem solving was cost-effective compared to a physical program, the combination of graded activity, problem solving and physical therapy was not cost-effective compared to physical therapy only. Interpretation of cost-effectiveness studies requires some sophistication, not least of all consideration of to whom the costs and benefits are apportioned. Substantial benefits may be evident at a societal level despite a modest mean clinical effect at an individual level, but the issue is complicated by the question of whether the costs are borne by the state, by insurers, or by the individual. Most of the societal costs associated with back pain are indirect costs, primarily work productivity losses (<LINK REF="REF-Lambeek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambeek 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maetzal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzal 2002</LINK>). Of interest then is whether research should focus on improving our capacity to identify those people at greatest risk of work disability (prognostic studies) and treat them distinctly from those whose back pain typically does not result in work absences or reduced productivity. Further, incorporation into MBR of treatment modalities that specifically focus on re-integration to the work place would be of value. It is recognised that in order to do so communication and collaboration barriers between employers, the healthcare system and insurance companies must be addressed.</P>

<P>Small changes were made to the inclusion criteria between this review and the previous version. This involved clarifying that interventions must be delivered by a truly multidisciplinary team of practitioners with different clinical backgrounds relevant to the portion of the intervention they delivered. The sensitivity and subgroup analyses described in the 'Methods' section were devised after publication of the previous version of the review but before commencement of searches for this review.</P>
