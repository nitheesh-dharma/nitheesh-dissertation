<TITLE>Informing consumers about how well birth control works</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-13 14:51:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>To make a good choice for family planning, people have to know how well different methods work. The pros and cons of the methods are important. People may choose birth control based on how well the method prevents pregnancy. Consumers also need to know what affects the usefulness of the birth control method.</P>
<P>Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials of ways to inform people about how well family planning methods prevent pregnancy. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. The new program could be compared to the usual practice or to another program or means of informing people.</P>
<P>We found seven trials with a total of 4526 women. Two had several sessions for participants. One of those looked at the choice of birth control method. Women in the test program more often chose to be sterilized or to use modern birth control than women with the usual counseling. In the other study, the groups had different sessions on family planning. Both groups increased their birth control use. However, the groups were similar at six months in using methods that work well to prevent pregnancy. Five trials had a single session for each group. In one, women learned more from a slide-and-sound format than from having a doctor talk to them. Another trial found that effectiveness categories were better than pregnancy numbers for comparing the methods. Still another study provided structured counseling using a flipchart on family planning methods. The groups were similar in choice of birth control and in numbers who still used their chosen method at three months. The last study used videos to inform couples about family planning. The groups were mostly similar in birth control use after the videos. But those who watched videos on motivation and on family planning did not choose pills or an injectable method as often as those who watched only the family planning video.</P>
<P>The studies had different types of participants and programs. We cannot say overall what would help consumers choose their method of birth control. Ways to inform women about family planning options should be tested in clinics. Trials should look at the choice of birth control method, along with how much consumers remember later.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness is crucial to making an informed choice. The consumer has to comprehend the pros and cons of the contraceptive methods being considered. Choice may be influenced by understanding the likelihood of pregnancy with each method and factors that influence effectiveness. </P>

<P>To review all randomized controlled trials comparing strategies for communicating to consumers the effectiveness of contraceptives in preventing pregnancy. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-13 14:48:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Through February 2013, we searched the computerized databases of MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO and CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. Previous searches also included EMBASE. We also examined references lists of relevant articles. For the initial review, we wrote to known investigators for information about other published or unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-15 18:46:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials that compared methods for communicating contraceptive effectiveness to consumers. The comparison could be usual practice or an alternative to the experimental intervention.</P>
<P>Outcome measures were knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness, attitude about contraception or toward any particular contraceptive, and choice or use of contraceptive method.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-09 18:44:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>For the initial review, two authors independently extracted the data. One author entered the data into RevMan, and a second author verified accuracy. For the update, an author and a research associate extracted, entered, and checked the data.</P>
<P>For dichotomous variables, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-13 15:00:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Seven trials met the inclusion criteria and had a total of 4526 women. Five were multi-site studies. Four trials were conducted in the USA, while Nigeria and Zambia were represented by one study each, and one trial was done in both Jamaica and India.</P>
<P>Two trials provided multiple sessions for participants. In one study that examined contraceptive choice, women in the expanded program were more likely to choose sterilization (OR 4.26; 95% CI 2.46 to 7.37) or use a modern contraceptive method (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.82 to 3.03), i.e., sterilization, pills, injectable, intrauterine device or barrier method. For the other study, the groups received educational interventions with differing format and intensity. Both groups reportedly had increases in contraceptive use, but they did not differ significantly by six months in consistent use of an effective contraceptive, i.e., sterilization, IUD, injectable, implant, and consistent use of oral contraceptives, diaphragm, or male condoms.</P>
<P>Five trials provided one session and focused on testing educational material or media. In one study, knowledge gain favored a slide-and-sound presentation versus a physician's oral presentation (MD -19.00; 95% CI -27.52 to -10.48). In another trial, a table with contraceptive effectiveness categories led to more correct answers than a table based on pregnancy numbers [ORs were 2.42 (95% CI 1.43 to 4.12) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.97)] or a table with effectiveness categories and pregnancy numbers [ORs were 2.58 (95% CI 1.5 to 4.42) and 2.03 (95% CI 1.13 to 3.64)]. Still another trial provided structured counseling with a flipchart on contraceptive methods. The intervention and usual-care groups did not differ significantly in choice of contraceptive method (by effectiveness category) or in continuation of the chosen method at three months. Lastly, a study with couples used videos to communicate contraceptive information (control, motivational, contraceptive methods, and both motivational and methods videos). The analyses showed no significant difference between the groups in the types of contraceptives chosen.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-13 14:50:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>These trials varied greatly in the types of participants and interventions to communicate contraceptive effectiveness. Therefore, we cannot say overall what would help consumers choose an appropriate contraceptive method. For presenting pregnancy risk data, one trial showed that effectiveness categories were better than pregnancy numbers. In another trial, audiovisual aids worked better than the usual oral presentation. Strategies should be tested in clinical settings and measured for their effect on contraceptive choice. More detailed reporting of intervention content would help in interpreting results. Reports could also include whether the instruments used to assess knowledge or attitudes were tested for validity or reliability. Follow-up should be incorporated to assess retention of knowledge over time. The overall quality of evidence was considered to be low for this review, given that five of the seven studies provided low or very low quality evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-09 18:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness is crucial to making an informed choice. The consumer has to comprehend the pros and cons of the contraceptive methods being considered. Choice may be influenced by understanding the likelihood of pregnancy with each method and factors that influence effectiveness, as well as the program's emphasis. A study promoting long-acting methods showed that 56% of the women chose intrauterine contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Secura-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Secura 2010</LINK>). The next most frequent choices were oral contraceptives (12%), the vaginal ring (12%) and a subdermal implant (11%). Intervention studies have found that most women cited method effectiveness as the most important reason for choosing a contraceptive (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2006</LINK>). A study of hormonal method preferences found that women chose the vaginal ring most often, and the main reasons were convenience and the low likelihood of error (<LINK REF="REF-Lete-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lete 2007</LINK>). The pill was second in frequency and was generally chosen for its effectiveness. In earlier studies of preferences for contraceptive characteristics, women identified effectiveness as the most important factor in choosing a contraceptive method (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grady-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 1999</LINK>). Researchers often take the concept of risk for granted, while health care consumers and providers may not understand enough about probability theory to interpret the available information, as it is often presented numerically (<LINK REF="REF-ARHP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARHP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahajan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahajan 2007</LINK>). Strategies for communicating information about contraceptive effectiveness and risks should be developed and tested formally. For example, the assumption that people understand fractions better than rates impedes communication about risk of chromosomal abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Vliet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Vliet 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Theories and models of education, communication, or behavioral change can help explain how an intervention works. Many health education interventions have no identified theoretical premise (<LINK REF="REF-Bellg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borrelli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrelli 2005</LINK>). To many professionals, the lack of any theory or principles guiding an educational or psychological intervention is similar to not having a physiologic basis for a medical intervention. <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK> reviewed decision aids for making health care choices. The authors discussed the need for learning what types of aids work better with certain groups of people (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>), but they did not address any theoretical basis. <LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK> abstracted the theoretical basis for interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents. Not all the strategies identified included contraceptive effectiveness since they were focused on adolescents.</P>
<P>Since published reports often have insufficient information on the intervention to assess its relevance, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2007</LINK> suggested that CONSORT guidelines be expanded to include more intervention information. Even if an intervention has a reasonable premise, it must be implemented with fidelity to the design to be useful. <LINK REF="REF-Borrelli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrelli 2011</LINK> developed a tool to assess the fidelity of health behavior interventions in clinical trials. The framework was intended for assessing current trials and can be useful in reviewing educational interventions. Domains of treatment fidelity include having a curriculum or treatment manual, specifying training of providers, assessing delivery of intervention, and assessing participants' receipt of treatment and ability to use the treatment skills.</P>
<P>This review focuses on randomized controlled trials of ways to communicate contraceptive effectiveness or pregnancy risk to consumers or potential users of the contraceptive methods. <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2011</LINK> examined interventions with an explicit theoretical basis for improving contraceptive use. Outcomes for the current review include attitudes toward a particular contraceptive method and knowledge about its effectiveness as well as contraceptive use. Others reviews focused more on contraceptive use than choice. <LINK REF="REF-Halpern-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 2011</LINK> studied interventions to improve adherence to hormonal contraceptive regimens. <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2012</LINK> reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of educational interventions to increase contraceptive use among postpartum women.</P>

<P>For the initial review, we looked for a theoretical base for the interventions. We had extracted data on constructs and identified implied theory or models. However, none of the original five trials had an explicit theoretical base. The studies employed a variety of guiding principles or concepts, which may have their basis in behavioral theories or models. Since they were not explicit, we removed this table for the 2012 update.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-09 18:19:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were examined for methodological quality, according to recommended principles (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Factors considered were study design, randomization method, allocation concealment, blinding, and losses to follow-up and early discontinuation. Adequate methods for allocation concealment include a centralized telephone system and the use of sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). High losses to follow-up threaten validity (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2011</LINK>). Limitations in design were presented in <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>, and were considered in interpreting the results.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-09-04 20:38:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. RevMan uses the inverse variance approach (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The measures could include mean scores for the assessment of knowledge or change in the mean scores. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated using a fixed-effect model. An example would be the proportion of women who chose a specific contraceptive method. Fixed effect and random effects give the same result if no heterogeneity exists, as when a comparison includes only one study.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-02-13 14:54:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Following GRADE principles, we assessed the quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>). When a meta-analysis is not viable due to varied interventions, a summary of findings table is not feasible. Therefore, we did not conduct a formal GRADE assessment, i.e., an evidence profile and summary of findings table (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the differences across studies, we first summarized characteristics of the interventions and the outcome assessments. We assessed the quality of evidence for this review based on the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> and the characteristics summary; we then summarized the evidence quality results. Quality could be high, moderate, low, or very low. RCTs were considered to be high quality then downgraded for each of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>allocation: no information on randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment, or no concealment;</LI>
<LI>outcome measure: no assessment of contraceptive method choice or use, or did not have independent assessment or record linkage;</LI>
<LI>follow-up length: outcome measured during or immediately after intervention</LI>
<LI>loss to follow-up greater than 20%.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We did not downgrade on the basis of blinding. Due to the differences between interventions, blinding of investigators and participants to assignment was difficult, although blinding of outcome assessors was more feasible.</P>

<P>Within studies, some methods of communicating contraceptive effectiveness appeared to work better than others. However, since the interventions differed across trials, we cannot determine the most useful approach. Two trials had multiple sessions for participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Omu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Omu 1989</LINK>, women in the enhanced intervention group were more likely to choose a more effective contraceptive method than women in the standard counseling group (<LINK REF="STD-Omu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Omu 1989</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2007</LINK>, the groups received educational interventions of differing intensity. Both reportedly had increased contraceptive use, but use did not differ significantly between the groups.</P>
<P>The dominant delivery mode was a single information session. Five studies tested approaches to communicating contraceptive information in one session. Three trials had no follow-up, so we do not know if the knowledge was retained or whether the intervention affected contraceptive choice. In <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 1984</LINK>, a slide-and-sound presentation resulted in more knowledge gain than the traditional oral presentation by a physician. Satisfaction was similar regardless of the medium used for communicating. In <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>, understanding of contraceptive effectiveness was better with a table focused on effectiveness categories than one with pregnancy numbers, and more women preferred the categories table. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2006</LINK>, comprehension was similar regardless of the type of chart viewed. More women in the group with the effectiveness categories chart liked their chart compared to women with an effectiveness chart stratified by typical or correct use. The other two trials had some follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Langston-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Langston 2010</LINK> provided structured counseling with a flipchart on contraceptive methods. The intervention and usual-care groups did not differ significantly in choice of contraceptive method (by effectiveness category) or in continuation of the chosen method at three months. <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2011</LINK> used videos to communicate contraceptive information to couples. The analyses showed no significant differences in the types of contraceptives chosen. The report only had baseline data; manuscripts are reportedly in progress with pregnancy and contraceptive use data.</P>
<P>Many of the trials focused on testing educational tools, and none had an explicit theoretical base. However, <LINK REF="STD-Omu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Omu 1989</LINK> mentioned perceived benefits from the Health Belief Model (<LINK REF="REF-Janz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janz 2002</LINK>). The intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2007</LINK> specifically addressed the constructs of positive expectations, norms, and self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in one's ability to perform a certain behavior). These concepts are elements of Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Baranowski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baranowski 2002</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2011</LINK>, one study arm received a motivational video. The report did not mention what motivational principles were used, e.g., the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills Model (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1992</LINK>). The limited use of theory or models in these trials contrasts with the extensive use in HIV research (<LINK REF="REF-Albarrac_x00ed_n-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albarracn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fishbein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishbein 2000</LINK>). Behavioral science has also been incorporated more formally into interventions for preventing sexually transmitted diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Aral-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aral 2007</LINK>). More intentional use of theory may help expand the knowledge base of what works in contraceptive counseling.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-09 17:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the limited number of studies, not all regions and settings were represented. Four trials were conducted in the USA, while Nigeria and Zambia were represented by one study each, and one trial was done in both Jamaica and India. Four studies took place in clinical settings, while three provided the intervention in the community.</P>
<P>We cannot meaningfully compare the varied types of interventions, outcome measures, and assessment timeframes (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Interventions included providing structured counseling in a post-abortion setting, showing charts of contraceptive methods to women in a shopping center, and conducting multiple risk-reduction sessions with HIV serodiscordant or concordant couples. Most of the reports did not provide specifics about how contraceptive effectiveness was presented, e.g., categories of relative effectiveness or tables of specific numbers. Outcomes ranged from understanding a chart the woman was viewing to consistent use of an effective contraceptive method. Further, some studies had follow-up of three to six months while others assessed outcomes immediately after the intervention.</P>

<P>The quality of evidence is based on the evidence from the included studies. The assessment addresses the utility of the evidence for this review as well as design features. The overall quality is considered to be low (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), given that five of the seven studies provided low or very low quality evidence for this review. Of the remaining two trials, the evidence was considered high quality from one and moderate quality from the other. The primary differences for the higher-quality studies included assessing contraceptive uptake or use as well as measuring the outcome during follow-up.</P>
<P>None of the studies mentioned whether the instruments used to assess knowledge or attitudes had been tested for validity or reliability. The interventions in four trials appeared to be primarily method-driven, as the studies tested tools or media to communicate contraceptive information (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langston-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Langston 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Health care providers routinely communicate contraceptive information to their patients. Due to the many types of interventions here, we cannot say overall what would best help consumers choose an appropriate contraceptive method. For presenting pregnancy risk data, one trial found that categories of method effectiveness were better, or more preferred, than numbers of pregnancies. Another trial indicated that audiovisual aids worked better than the usual oral presentation by a physician. One trial showed that an enhanced counseling program led to more women choosing sterilization, which was emphasized, or a modern method of contraception.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-09 17:48:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These trials varied greatly in the types of participants and interventions to communicate contraceptive effectiveness. More detailed reporting of intervention content would help in interpreting results. Reporting should include whether the instruments used to assess knowledge or attitudes were tested for validity or reliability. Strategies for communicating information should be tested in clinical settings and measured for their effect on contraceptive choice. Follow-up should be incorporated to assess retention of knowledge over time.</P>
