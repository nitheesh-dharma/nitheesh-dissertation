<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 12:39:50 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral candidiasis (thrush) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurs commonly and recurs frequently, often presenting as an initial manifestation of the disease. Interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV-associated oral thrush form an integral component of maintaining the quality of life for affected individuals. This review evaluated the effects of interventions in preventing or treating oral thrush in children and adults with HIV infection. Thirty three trials (n=3445) were included. Twenty two trials investigated treatment and eleven trials investigate prevention. There was no difference with regard to clinical cure between fluconazole compared to ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole and posaconazole. Fluconazole, gentian violet and ketoconazole were superior to nystatin. Compared to placebo and no treatment, fluconazole was effective in preventing clinical episodes from occurring. Continuous fluconazole was better than intermittent treatment. Insufficient evidence was found to come to any conclusion about the effectiveness of clotrimazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole or chlorhexidine with regard to OC prophylaxis.</P>

<P>Oral candidiasis (OC) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurs commonly and recurs frequently, often presenting as an initial manifestation of the disease. Left untreated, these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV-associated oral candidal lesions form an integral component of maintaining the quality of life for affected individuals.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of any intervention in preventing or treating OC in children and adults with HIV infection.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-06 17:01:55 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>The search strategy was based on that of the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group. The following electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1982 to 2005: Medline, AIDSearch, EMBASE and CINAHL. The <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I>, <I>Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness,</I> and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were also searched through May 2005. The abstracts of relevant conferences, including the International Conferences on AIDS and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, as indexed by AIDSLINE, were also reviewed. The strategy was iterative, in that references of included studies were searched for additional references. All languages were included.</P>
<P>The updated database search was done for the period 2005 up to 2009. The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I>, <I>Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectivenes</I>s and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library. </I>AIDSearch was not searched for the updated search as it ceased publication during 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-09-28 01:28:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth D Pienaar">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered, irrespective of whether the control group received a placebo. Participants were HIV positive adults and children.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional data where necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:57:13 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the first publication of the review in 2006, forty studies were retrieved. Twenty eight trials (n=3225) met inclusion criteria. During the update search for the review a, further six studies were identified. Of these, five met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The review now includes 33 studies (n=3445): 22 assessing treatment and 11 assessing prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Six studies were done in developing countries, 16 in the United States of America and the remainder in Europe. 
</P>
<P>Treatment<BR/>Treatment was assessed in the majority of trials looking at both clinical and mycological cures. In the majority of comparisons there was only one trial. Compared to nystatin, fluconazole favoured clinical cure in adults (1 RCT; n=167; RR 1.69; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.23). There was no difference with regard to clinical cure between fluconazole compared to ketoconazole (2 RCTs; n=83; RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.66), itraconazole (2 RCTs; n=434; RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16), clotrimazole (2 RCTs; n=358; RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.42) or posaconazole (1 RCT; n=366; RR1.32; 95% CI 0.36 to 4.83). Two trials compared different dosages of fluconazole with no difference in clinical cure. When compared with clotrimazole, both fluconazole (2 RCTs; n=358; RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.87) and itraconazole (1 RCT; n=123; RR 2.20; 95% CI 1.43 to3.39) proved to be better for mycological cure. Both gentian violet (1 RCT; n=96; RR 5.28; 95% CI 1.23 to 22.55) and ketoconazole (1 RCT; n=92; RR 5.22; 95% CI 1.21 to 22.53) were superior to nystatin in bringing about clinical cure. A single trial compared gentian violet with lemon juice and lemon grass with no significant difference in clinical cure between the groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Prevention<BR/>Successful prevention was defined as the prevention of a relapse while receiving prophylaxis. Fluconazole was compared with placebo in five studies (5 RCTs; n=599; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.74) and with no treatment in another (1 RCT; n=65; RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.34). In both instances the prevention of clinical episodes was favoured by fluconazole. Comparing continuous fluconazole treatment with intermittent treatment (2 RCTs; n=891; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.83), there was no significant difference between the two treatment arms. Chlorhexidine was compared with normal saline in a single study with no significant difference between the treatment arms.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 09:57:18 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five new studies were added to the review, but their results do not alter the final conclusion of the review.</P>
<P>Implications for practice<BR/>Due to there being only one study in children, it is not possible to make recommendations for treatment or prevention of OC in children. Amongst adults, there were few studies per comparison. Due to insufficient evidence, no conclusion could be made about the effectiveness of clotrimazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole with regard to OC prophylaxis. In comparison to placebo, fluconazole is an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop, as well as the cost of prophylaxis, might impact the feasibility of implementation. No studies were found comparing fluconazole with other interventions. The direction of findings suggests that ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and clotrimazole improved the treatment outcomes.</P>
<P>Implications for research<BR/>It is encouraging that low-cost alternatives are being tested, but more research needs to be on in this area and on interventions like gentian violet and other less expensive anti-fungal drugs to treat OC. More well-designed treatment trials with larger samples are needed to allow for sufficient power to detect differences in not only clinical, but also mycological, response and relapse rates. There is also a strong need for more research to be done on the treatment and prevention of OC in children as it is reported that OC is the most frequent fungal infection in children and adolescents who are HIV positive. More research on the effectiveness of less expensive interventions also needs to be done in resource-poor settings. Currently few trials report outcomes related to quality of life, nutrition, or survival. Future researchers should consider measuring these when planning trials. Development of resistance remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area. It is recommended that trials be more standardised and conform more closely to CONSORT.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 12:42:18 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral candidiasis (OC) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurs commonly and recurs frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Arribas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arribas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenspan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenspan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gennaro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gennaro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reznik-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reznik 2005</LINK>), often presenting as an initial manifestation of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Coogan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coogan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nittayananta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nittayananta 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rachanis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachanis 2001</LINK>). Though <I>Candida albicans</I> is most commonly implicated, other organisms have also been identified. If left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV-associated oral candidal lesions form an integral component of maintaining the quality of life for affected individuals. For brevity's sake, the term oral HIV lesions will be used for oropharyngeal infections associated with HIV/AIDS infection.</P>
<P>The spectrum of oral HIV lesions seen include those of fungal, viral, bacterial and neoplastic origin. This review deals with oral candidiasis, the most common oral HIV lesion seen in both children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Gomez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Gomez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>). Four forms occur (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>) - pseudomembranous candidiasis, erythematous candidiasis, angular chelitis and mixed candidal lesions. OC has been found to occur more commonly in those with advancing HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984</LINK>), often requiring more aggressive forms of treatment. The presence of OC, which can be painful, may lead to a reduction in food intake (<LINK REF="REF-Oude-Lashof-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oude Lashof 2004</LINK>), or a reduction in the correct kinds of food, with subsequent malnutrition, which may compromise an already ill patient even more. Additionally, OC has been found to lead to the loss of taste and smell in HIV-infected patients and can subsequently impair the intake of food and contribute to wasting (<LINK REF="REF-Heald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heald 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paillaud-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paillaud 2004</LINK>). Xerostomia, a reduction in the flow of saliva, is a common occurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Arendorf-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arendorf 1998</LINK>). It may occur as a result of the disease process or secondary to medications used. Not only does this condition render the normal protective components of saliva less effective, but it also interferes with the solubility of topical antifungals. It has also been found that concomitant drug therapy with antibiotics may influence the colonization and proliferation of the yeast within the oral cavity.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-05-12 01:28:06 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth D Pienaar">
<P>The treatment of mucosal fungal infections is dominated by the azole compounds, which can be used either topically or systemically. The antifungal agents for the treatment of OC in adults, together with their recommended dosages, are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Similarly the antifungal agents for the treatment of OC in children are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, together with their dosages, as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Gomez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Gomez 1999</LINK>. Mucosal diseases do however have the propensity for some patients to suffer from repeated relapses (<LINK REF="REF-Rex-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 2000</LINK>). The suppression of OC is possible with the use of topical agents such as clotrimazole or nystatin, or with systemic agents such as ketoconazole or fluconazole (<LINK REF="REF-Gallant-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallant 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pankhurst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pankhurst 2005</LINK>). The routine use of prophylactic treatment in patients with OC may lead to the development of resistance, especially to the azole antifungal agents like fluconazole. Resistance has been found to develop in patients with advanced HIV disease or after repeated or long-term therapy for OC (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1998</LINK>). There is however an overall lack of data on resistance following antifungal usage (<LINK REF="REF-Patton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 12:43:56 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While antifungals are available as either topical or systemic agents, the choice of treatment is influenced by many variables. Current criteria for prescription of treatment are either arbitrary or determined by availability and affordability within particular clinical settings, or based on specified hospital protocols. In resource-poor settings the availability is dependent on the cost of treatment.</P>
<P>Whilst antiretroviral therapy may not cure OC, evidence suggests that individuals on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) have less frequent and severe occurrences (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt_x002d_West-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt-West 2000</LINK>). An observational cohort study, <LINK REF="REF-Arribas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arribas 2000</LINK> found that in patients with advanced HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy including a protease inhibitor, had a positive impact on OC. <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2006</LINK> investigated the effect of prolonged HAART on OC and found that it is highly effective in decreasing OC in association with a rise in CD4+ lymphocyte count. It has been reported that the risk of having OC can be halved in patients treated with HAART (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2006</LINK>).</P>

The <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I>, <I>Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectivenes</I>s and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> were also searched through May 2005.</P>
<P>The abstracts of relevant conferences, including the International Conferences on AIDS and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, as indexed by AIDSearch, were also searched. The reference lists of all review articles and primary articles identified were also searched. The abstracts of the International Conference on AIDS and STDs in Africa (ICASA) were not reviewed as we were unable to obtain access to the abstracts of the past conferences.</P>
<P>The search strategy was iterative, in that references of included studies were searched for additional references. All languages were included.</P>
<P>A search was undertaken using MeSH terms and the full strategy is listed in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. These strategies was combined with the search strategy for RCTs as recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The updated database search was done using the original search terms in July 2009 for the period 2005 up to 2009 and including the date the search was done. The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I>, <I>Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectivenes</I>s and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library. </I>AIDSearch was not searched for the updated search as it ceased publication during 2008.

<P>Data from eligible trials was extracted and coded by two independent authors (EP and TY) using a standardised data extraction form. Where there were differences they were resolved by the review mentor, Nandi Siegfried. The following information was collected for each trial: type and dose of intervention used; duration of treatment; patient characteristics, including number of patients, gender, age, and co-morbid conditions; adverse events and length of trial follow-up. Also noted were the various diagnostic criteria used for the identification of lesions, these included presumptive as well as definitive criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>).

<P>EP and TY independently examined the components of each included trial for risk of bias using a standard form. This included information on the sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (participants, personnel and outcome assessor), and incomplete outcome data.

The methodological components of the trials were assessed and classified as adequate, inadequate or unclear as per Chapter 8 the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Where differences arose, these were resolved by discussions with the mentor for the review.<BR/>

<P>
<B>Treatment<BR/>
</B>Twenty-two of the included trials looked at treatment. Treatment success was assessed in the majority of trials by looking at both clinical and mycological cure. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for those comparisons where the overall estimate of effect was statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<I>1) Fluconazole versus Ketoconazole<BR/>
</I>Two trials, one in adults (<LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1989</LINK>) (N = 37) and one in children (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1994</LINK>) (N = 46), compared oral fluconazole and ketoconazole. In the trial in adults, fluconazole was more effective than ketoconazole and favoured clinical cure (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15). This was, however, not the case in the study in children (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). From the combined result for adults and children there was no significant difference between fluconazole and ketoconazole (RR 1.27; 95 %CI 0.97 to 1.66), and there was no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 32.4%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 1.48 with P = 0.22). Amongst adults (<LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1989</LINK>) there was no significant differences in mycological cure. The trial in children did not give the results for mycological cure separately, but combined with clinical cure and that was also not significantly different between fluconazole and ketoconazole (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mycologically confirmed relapses were more likely in patients receiving fluconazole. <LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1989</LINK> followed 13 of the 18 patients assigned to fluconazole, for one month post-treatment during which time there were six relapses (46%) after a mean of 18 days (range 10 to 24 days) with fluconazole (18 randomised, and four lost to follow-up) and, while there was one relapse in the ketoconazole group (19 randomised, 12 cured and three lost to follow-up) 13 days after the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal tract toxicity (GIT) was the main adverse effect. <LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1989</LINK> reported severe nausea in one fluconazole patient. Diarrhoea and abdominal pain occurred in one ketoconazole patient (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1994</LINK>), and an increase in the liver enzymes (ALT and AST) occurred more often in the ketoconazole group and is reported as being mild transitory laboratory abnormalities. One patient in the fluconazole group also had thrombocytopaenia (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>2) Fluconazole vs Itraconazole </I>
<BR/>Three trials (N = 474) compared fluconazole with itraconazole (<LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graybill-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Graybill 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Graybill-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Graybill 1998a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998a</LINK> both had three arms, one fluconazole and two itraconazole. In <LINK REF="STD-Graybill-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Graybill 1998a</LINK> the itraconazole doses in the different arms were 200 mg per day for seven days and 200 mg per day for 14 days, in <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998a</LINK> the doses in the two itraconazole arms were 100 mg per day for seven days and 14 days respectively. In order to include both itraconazole arms in the meta-analysis the number of participants in the fluconazole arm was divided in two (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>). The combined RR for clinical cure was 1.12 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.36) with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>67.6%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 12.35 with P = 0.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because <LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1998</LINK> (RR 3.75; 95% CI 1.51 to 9.34) was an outlier, the meta-analysis was repeated excluding this study. The revised analysis also did not indicate a benefit of one drug over the other, RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.16) with no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 4.3%; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>3.14 with P = 0.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Exploring sources of heterogeneity, mean CD4 cell counts were similar at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Graybill-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Graybill 1998a</LINK>, itraconazole (7 days) was 134 cells/mm<SUP>3 </SUP>(3 to 707), itraconazole (14 days) was 134 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> and fluconazole 162 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> (2 to 702). <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998a</LINK>: fluconazole = 136 cells/ml; itraconazole (7 days) = 151 cells/ml and itraconazole (14 days) = 160 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. <LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1998</LINK> reported 38 cells/mm<SUP>3 </SUP>for the fluconazole arm and 22 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> for the itraconazole arm. None of the trials reported antiretroviral usage. <LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1998</LINK> however used itraconazole in tablet form as opposed to the oral solution used by both <LINK REF="STD-Graybill-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Graybill 1998a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998a</LINK> and fluconazole as a single dose compared to a 2 week course in the other two studies.</P>
<P>Use of fluconazole favoured mycological cure in one of the five trials. The combined RR indicated no benefit of one drug over the other (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46) with no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 43.0%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 7.02, P = 0.28) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). None of these showed a benefit in minimising post treatment relapse (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21) with no heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 0.66, P = 0.96, I<SUP>2 </SUP>0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-De-Wit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Wit 1998</LINK> reported that no adverse events were experienced in either group. <LINK REF="STD-Graybill-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Graybill 1998a</LINK> reported that 25% of participants in each arm experienced adverse events. Nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain were the most common events experienced. Respiratory side effects were experienced by 21% in the fluconazole arm and 12.5% in the itraconazole arm. <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998a</LINK> reported no difference in the frequency of adverse events between the three treatment groups (33% in itraconazole twice a day and 48% in the itraconazole daily group and 43% in the fluconazole group). GIT symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse event. One participant in each of the treatment groups died of causes unrelated to the study drug.</P>

<I>3) Fluconazole vs Clotrimazole</I>
<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 1992</LINK>) (N = 358) compared fluconazole with clotrimazole. The combined RR for clinical cure (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.42) using the random effects model indicated that no treatment was superior (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Fluconazole resulted in mycological cure in <LINK REF="STD-Pons-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1993</LINK> but not in <LINK REF="STD-Redding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 1992</LINK>.

<P>By day 28 post treatment 1/13 (18%) fluconazole and 2/11 (18%) clotrimazole patients relapsed (<LINK REF="STD-Redding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 1992</LINK>) compared to 23/130 (18%) fluconazole and 48/96 (50%) clotrimazole (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1993</LINK>), combined RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.54 (no significant heterogeneity). While by day 42, four out of 13 (31%) fluconazole and five out of 11(45%) clotrimazole patients relapsed (<LINK REF="STD-Redding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 1992</LINK>) and 34/99 (34%) fluconazole patients and 23/58 (40%) clotrimazole patients relapsed (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reported adverse events were similar across both arms in <LINK REF="STD-Pons-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1993</LINK> (18% in fluconazole vs 19% in clotrimazole) with GIT the most common. Less common events included headache, dizziness, pruritis, rash, sweating and dry mouth as well as liver function abnormalities. In the majority of cases the side-effects were mild to moderate in severity. Two participants in the fluconazole and seven in the clotrimazole arms were withdrawn from the study because of non-life threatening treatment adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-Redding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 1992</LINK> reported that adverse events were infrequent in both treatment groups. No patients were withdrawn from therapy because of adverse events.</P>

<U>
<BR/>
</U>One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Pons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1997</LINK> (N = 167) compared fluconazole with nystatin. Fluconazole favoured clinical cure, (RR 1.69; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.23) and mycological cure, (RR 10.37; 95% CI 3.89 to 27.66). For the outcome clinical cure, the NNT was calculated as 3 with 95%CI 2 to 7, and for mycological cure the NNT was 2 with 95%CI 2 to 3 (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). GIT adverse events were the most common. One participant in each treatment group withdrew due to either nausea or vomiting. Liver enzymes were elevated in two participants in the fluconazole group. A sample of 13 participants per group was followed up for 2 weeks, 5/13 (38%) in the fluconazole stat group and 3/13 (23%) in the daily fluconazole group relapsed.</P>

<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Linpiyawan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Linpiyawan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1997</LINK>) (N =152), compared itraconazole with clotrimazole. In <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1997</LINK> 162 patients were enrolled. Of these, 123 were HIV<SUP>+</SUP>, 26 HIV<SUP>-</SUP> and the HIV status of the remaining 13 was unknown. For the purpose of this review, it was decided to use the 123 as the denominator. Itraconazole significantly favoured clinical cure in the <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1997</LINK> trial with the RR 2.03. <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>: The combined RR 1.34; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.2, with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 84.9%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 6.60; P=0.01).

<B>Treatment</B>
<BR/>A number of treatment options, both topical and systemic, are available for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis. The main classes of antifungal agents used for the treatment of oral candidiasis are the polyenes (e.g. nystatin and amphotericin), imidazoles (e.g. clotrimazole) and the tri-azoles such as fluconazole (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1998</LINK>). Even though topical agents may be effective, they are very often unpalatable and their use can also be inconvenient (<LINK REF="REF-De-Wit-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Wit 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, 22 trials investigating the treatment of OC met our inclusion criteria. For the outcome clinical cure, fluconazole was more effective than nystatin, had similar effects as posaconazole and had no difference in effect compared to ketoconazole, itraconazole and clotrimazole. The effect of itraconazole was the same as that of clotrimazole and ketoconazole. Gentian violet and ketoconazole had similar effects and were each better than nystatin. Ketoconazole also had the same effect as miconazole. In contrast to clinical cure, both fluconazole and itraconazole were better than clotrimazole for mycological cure, that is a negative <I>Candida</I> culture or negative KOH microscopic preparation.</P>
<P>One new study <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK> compared gentian violet with lemon juice and lemon grass as treatment for the OC. There was no significant difference in effect between the three different interventions.</P>
<P>In a previously published review, Patton and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Patton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2001</LINK>) found that the efficacy of fluconazole ranged from 87% to 100%, bringing about a complete clinical response, that is the absence of signs or symptoms of OC, or both. This is similar to what was found in this review, namely that the effectiveness of fluconazole in bringing about clinical cure of OC is the highest, followed by itraconazole. This is also similar to the findings of a trial comparing fluconazole with itraconazole for the treatment of OC in cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Oude-Lashof-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oude Lashof 2004</LINK>). The fact that itraconazole did not give significant results could be explained by drug interactions and also unpredictable absorption of itraconazole capsules (<LINK REF="REF-De-Wit-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Wit 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sample size of the treatment trials ranged from 22 to 357 with ten trials having less than 100 participants. With such small sample sizes it is thus not possible to draw any real robust conclusions. Some trials had a very high loss to follow-up creating underpowered studies. Due to the limited number of studies per comparison combined with the small sample size of the majority of studies the meta-analysis did not assist in raising the power of the comparison to such an extent as to allow for meaningful results in most comparisons.</P>
<P>The trials did not always use the same outcome measures which also made it more difficult to combine the results. If trials were standardised and conformed to CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1987</LINK>) it would improve research, reporting and hence also clinical practice.</P>
<P>Five of the 22 studies investigating treatment of OC were conducted in developing countries (<LINK REF="STD-Hamza-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hamza 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linpiyawan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Linpiyawan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nyst-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nyst 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Roey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Roey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK>). Lack of availability and cost of some of the drugs in resource-poor countries may limit the relevance to all settings.</P>
<P>In addition this review is not able to make definitive recommendations regarding the treatment of OC in HIV-positive children as only one trial with children was found (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1994</LINK>). The sample size of the trial was also small (n=48).</P>
<P>
<B>Prevention<BR/>
</B>Eleven trials investigated the prevention of OC in adults. As no trials investigating prevention in children was found this review is not able to make recommendations regarding OC prevention in HIV-positive children. Compared to placebo and no treatment, fluconazole was effective in preventing clinical episodes from occurring. <LINK REF="STD-Revankar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Revankar 1998</LINK> found that continuous fluconazole was more effective than intermittent treatment. In contrast, both nystatin and itraconazole were not effective in preventing OC. A review of studies of the use of nystatin in immunodepressed patients also found similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2005</LINK>). No trial was found that investigated the prevention of OC in children.</P>
<P>Only one study reported drug resistance testing for <I>Candida </I>species where there had been prophylactic failure (<LINK REF="STD-Pagani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pagani 2002</LINK>). None of the studies reported on the impact of compliance with treatment on the results of studies. Compliance is important as failure of prophylaxis might be due to the patient's inability or unwillingness to adhere to the therapy rather than the true reflection of the treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Patton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fluconazole, a bis-tri-azole antifungal agent, is not altered by gastric acidity and therefore has less risk of hepatotoxicity. There is however concern that prolonged use of fluconazole increases the risk of developing azole-resistant <I>Candida albicans</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2001</LINK>). When the decision has to be made whether to provide prophylaxis for OC it is necessary to weigh the risks and cost against the benefits. In patients who are HIV positive, it is rare for OC to develop into possible fatal fungemia or even systemic candidiasis (<LINK REF="STD-Just_x002d_Nubling-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Just-Nubling 1991a</LINK>) which makes waiting until the OC appears before starting treatment an alternative to prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Although the use of fluconazole reduces the risk of OC in patients with advanced HIV it is not recommended as primary prophylaxis because there is potential for resistant <I>Candida</I> organisms to develop as well as the cost of prophylaxis. For the same reasons, chronic prophylaxis is also not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>). In patients with low CD4 cell counts, the prolonged use of systemically absorbed azoles increases their risk of developing azole resistance.</P>
<P>The number of participants enrolled in the studies ranged from 13 to 323 with five of the nine included studies investigating prevention having less than 100 participants. Some trials had a very high loss of participants to follow-up creating underpowered studies. Due to the limited number of studies per comparison combined with the small sample size of the majority of studies, the meta-analysis did not assist in raising the power of the comparison to such an extent as to allow for meaningful results in most comparisons.</P>
<P>As in the case of the treatment trials, prevention trials did not always use the same outcome measures which made it more difficult to combine the results. Again standardisation and conforming closely to CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1987</LINK>) will improve research, reporting and clinical practice.<BR/>
<BR/>None of the included studies investigating the prevention of OC were conducted in resource-poor settings and this may limit the relevance of our results in some settings.<BR/>As no trials investigating the prevention of OC in children were identified, this review is unable to come to any conclusion as to the prevention of OC in children.</P>
<P>
<B>HAART</B>
<BR/>None of the included studies investigated the effects of HAART or any other form of antiretroviral treatment on OC treatment or prevention. The use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV infection may be associated oral lesions related to its side effects as well as reconstitution of the immune system (IRIS). While protease inhibitors have been shown to directly attenuate the adherence of <I>Candida albicans</I> to epithelial cells in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Bektic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bektic 2001</LINK>), (<LINK REF="REF-Cauda-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauda 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cassone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassone 1999</LINK>). The impact of this intervention warrants further investigation with regard to clinical presentation and mycological effect.</P>
<P>
<B>Economics</B>
<BR/>None of the trials provided any information on the cost-effectiveness of either treatment or prophylaxis of OC. There is evidence that the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis of HIV-related opportunistic infections varies widely, but no specifics were provided on OC (<LINK REF="REF-Freedberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedberg 1998</LINK>). In general, azoles are the more expensive compounds, with ketoconazole being cheaper, but with more side-effects. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nyst-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nyst 1992</LINK>) reported the cost of gentian violet, nystatin and ketoconazole in Africa as this could have a major impact on the choice of treatment. Gentian violet is much cheaper at 0.5 US $/30 ml than ketoconazole (13-17 US$/10 tablets) and nystatin oral suspension (of which 4 bottles of 2.4 million units are necessary per treatment course at 4-5 US$/bottle).</P>

<P>Four new studies were added to the review, but their results does not alter the final conclusion of the review.</P>
<P>Due to only one study in children it is not possible to make recommendations for treatment or prevention of OC in children. Amongst adults, there were few studies per comparison. Insufficient evidence was found to come to any conclusion about the effectiveness of clotrimazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole with regard to OC prophylaxis. The direction of findings suggests that ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and clotrimazole improved the treatment outcomes. In comparison to placebo, fluconazole is an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop as well as the cost of prophylaxis might impact on the feasibility of implementation. No studies were found comparing fluconazole with other interventions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-10-06 17:04:35 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>It is encouraging that low-cost alternatives are being tested, but more research needs to be on in this area and interventions like gentian violet and other less expensive anti-fungal drugs to treat OC to be evaluated in larger studies. More well designed treatment trials with larger sample size are needed to allow for sufficient power to detect differences in not only clinical, but also mycological response and relapse rates. There is also a strong need for more research to be done on the treatment and prevention of OC in children as it is reported that OC is the most frequent fungal infection in children and adolescents who are HIV positive. More research on the effectiveness of less expensive interventions also needs to be done in resource-poor settings. Currently few trials report outcomes related to quality of life, impact on daily activities, nutrition, or survival. Future researchers should consider measuring these when planning trials. Development of resistance remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area. Oral lesions associated with HIV form part of the clinical spectrum of immune reconstitution associated with ARV use. More stringent criteria needs to be applied to studies in order to elucidate the true effect of OC treatment medication in persons using ARV therapy.<BR/>
<BR/>It is recommended that trials be more standardised and conform more closely to CONSORT.

<P>Clinical Cure : Signs and symptoms of OPC were graded on scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Symptoms and signs included soreness, burning or pain, dysphagia, erythema, and presence of white plaques. Extent of lesions present was graded on a scale of 0 (no lesions) to 4 (lesions covering more than 70% of oral mucosa). These scores were combined to give an overall clinical score. Clinical cure was defined as disappearance of all symptoms (clinical score = 0), improvement defined as clinical score lower than baseline score and failure as no change in clinical score or worsening of clinical symptoms.</P>
<P>Relapse: defined as initial improvement or cure followed by reappearance of symptoms within 30 days after baseline examination.</P>
<P>Mycological evaluation: eradication was defined as recovery of less than 10 colony forming units (CFUs)/ml, improvement as a count below baseline count but above 10 CFUs/ml and failure as an increase or no change.</P>
