<P>Insufficient evidence exists to support the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of conventional ventilation for preterm infants with severe lung disease who are given positive pressure ventilation. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is a newer way of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs. Theoretically, HFOV may produce less injury to the lungs, particularly when high pressures are used on conventional positive pressure ventilation. This review of the evidence from one randomised controlled trial suggests there might be less short-term lung injury from high frequency oscillatory ventilation. However, more babies in this group developed haemorrhage in and around the fluid spaces in the brain (cerebral ventricles) and this harm might outweigh any benefit. More information is needed to clarify the balance between benefits and harms of high frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of conventional positive pressure ventilation for preterm infants with severe lung disease.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Despite the increased use of antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement therapy, pulmonary disease, principally due to the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates. In addition to immaturity, lung distension during conventional ventilation (CV) is thought to be responsible for pulmonary air leak (PAL) and, together with oxygen toxicity, may be important in the cause of chronic lung disease (CLD). Studies of animals have suggested that high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is an effective method of providing ventilation and oxygenation in severe experimental pulmonary disease and may result in less lung injury.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of HFOV compared to conventional ventilation (CV) on pulmonary air leak and CLD in preterm infants with very severe lung disease requiring ventilation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A search was carried out for all randomised controlled trials from MEDLINE (1980 - April 2007) and EMBASE (1982 - April 2007) using the MeSH and text terms, "high frequency ventilation", "high frequency oscillatory ventilation", "oscillatory ventilation". The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials and trials identified by the Neonatal Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2007) were also reviewed. Information was also sought from experts in the field, cross references from studies and proceedings of meetings of the American Society for Pediatric Research (1991 - 2006).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of HFOV vs. CV as rescue therapy in preterm infants with severe pulmonary dysfunction.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard review method of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This includes independent quality assessment and data extraction by the second author. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) were used to express treatment effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one trial was found and this showed that rescue HFOV caused a reduction in any new pulmonary air leak (PAL) [RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55,0.96), RD -0.17 (95% CI -0.32, -0.03)]. The number of infants that needed to be treated (NNT) to prevent one infant having any PAL was six (95% CI 3, 37). There was no significant difference in the rate of PIE or of gross pulmonary air leak, such as pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. There was no significant effect on mortality or the use of IPPV at 30 days.</P>
<P>The rate of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) of any grade was increased in infants treated with HFOV, [RR 1.77 (95% CI 1.06, 2.96), RD 0.16 (95% CI 0.02, 0.29)]. Thus, for every six infants (95% CI 3, 50) given rescue HFOV, one infant developed IVH of any grade. There was a stronger, but non-significant trend towards an increase in severe IVH (grades 3 or 4 IVH).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient information on the use of rescue HFOV to make recommendations for practice. The small amount of data that exists suggest that harm might outweigh any benefit. Any future use of HFOV as rescue therapy for preterm infants with severe RDS should be within randomised controlled trials and address important outcomes such as longer term pulmonary and neurological function.</P>

An uncontrolled rescue study indicated that it may be valuable in the management of infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema, a form of PAL (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1986</LINK>).

<P>2) Both benefits (in terms of PAL and CLD) and harm (IVH) are increased with rescue HFOV vs. CV at lower gestational age and birth weight, due to higher baseline risks.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-05-21 08:12:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one trial was found (<LINK REF="STD-HIFO-1993" TYPE="STUDY">HIFO 1993</LINK>). One hundred and eighty two preterm infants (less than 35 weeks gestational age and birth weight more than 500 grams) with severe RDS (high peak and mean ventilator pressures, high inspired oxygen and low PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/PAO<SUB>2</SUB> ratios) who had, or were at risk of, developing PAL were entered.</P>
<P>Infants could be randomised up to 48 hours of age and the mean age for HFOV was 21 hours and for CV 22 hours. The primary outcome was development or worsening of PAL. PIE was graded as mild (perihilar or focal bubbles of any size); moderate (diffuse bubbles &lt; 2 mm); and severe (diffuse bubbles &gt; 2 mm). Gross PAL was defined as pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. The data used in the meta-analysis were 'moderate or severe PIE' or the 'presence of gross PAL' in infants who developed PAL during the treatment phase of the trial and those whose PAL progressed during this period (<LINK REF="STD-HIFO-1993" TYPE="STUDY">HIFO 1993</LINK> table III).</P>
<P>A number of other studies were found that evaluated the elective use of HFOV (infants were eligible if they had RDS and as soon as they were given IPPV), typically being randomised in the first 12 hours of life. They are the subject of another review in The Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2003</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The subjects were randomised but concealment was unclear. The treatment was not blinded. Three infants in each group were excluded from analysis because of protocol violations. The primary outcome of PAL was blindly assessed, while the blinding of head ultrasound assessments for IVH was not specified. Complete pre and post-entry chest x-rays were available for 83 (97%) HFOV infants and 87 (97%) CV infants. IVH was assessed by cranial ultrasound in 81 (94%) HFOV infants and 84 (93%) CV infants.</P>

<B>RESCUE HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATORY VENTILATION VS CONVENTIONAL VENTILATION FOR PULMONARY DYSFUNCTION IN PRETERM INFANTS</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pulmonary outcomes (Outcomes 01.01 - 01.05):<BR/>
</B>Rescue HFOV resulted in a reduction in any new pulmonary air leak (PAL) [RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55, 0.96), RD -0.17 (95% CI -0.32, -0.03)]. The number of infants that needed to be treated (NNT) to prevent one infant having any PAL was six (95% CI 3, 37). There was no significant difference in the rate of PIE [RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.78, 1.89)] or of gross pulmonary air leak such as pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax [RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.45, 1.42)]. Use of IPPV at 30 days was not significantly different in the HFOV and CV groups [RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.54, 1.66).</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality (Outcome 01.0</B>
<B>4</B>
<B> and 01.06):</B>
<BR/>Mortality rates at 28 - 30 days of age were not significantly different [RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.54, 1.66)]), nor were the rates of the combined outcome 'death or IPPV' at 30 days [RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.72, 1.45)]. Other measures such as death at discharge and CLD at 36 weeks PMA, are not reported. </P>
<P>
<B>Neurological outcomes (Outcomes 01.07 and 01.08):</B>
<BR/>The rate of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) of any grade was increased in infants treated with HFOV [RR 1.77 (95% CI 1.06, 2.96), RD 0.16 (95% CI 0.02, 0.29)]. Thus for every six infants (95% CI 3, 50) given rescue HFOV, one infant developed IVH of any grade. There was a stronger but non-significant trend towards an increase in the more severe grades 3 or 4 IVH [ RR 3.11 (0.65, 14.97)]. Rates of periventricular leukomalacia were not reported.</P>
<P>The intended subgroup analyses could not be performed because all infants in the trial were given HFOV using a 'high volume strategy'; surfactant was administered to a minority of infants and their data were not reported separately; and, although infants were stratified by birth weight at randomisation, data were not reported by these strata.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-21 08:12:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single trial examined in this review had the primary aim of reducing pulmonary air leak in infants at great risk due to severe RDS and reducing the use of mechanical ventilation. It was carried out before the general availability of surfactant, when severe pulmonary air leak was a greater problem. The relevance of any reported benefits in current clinical practice is uncertain. Longer term pulmonary outcomes, such as use of oxygen therapy at 36 weeks postmenstrual age or at home, were not reported.</P>
<P>Of concern is the increased rate of IVH and the lack of information on PVL and on neurodevelopmental follow up.</P>
<P>The results were similar to those observed in the reviews of elective use of HFOV (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2003</LINK>) and the elective use of high frequency jet ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998a</LINK>). In these latter reviews, both benefits, in terms of pulmonary outcomes, and harms, in terms of ultrasound evidence of brain injury, were found. There was a suggestion from subgroup analyses in these reviews that brain injury might be associated with the use of lower mean airway pressures during HFOV and high frequency jet ventilation. The only trial in the present review used a high volume strategy, so this evaluation could not be made in this review.</P>
<P>Another Cochrane Review examined the use of rescue HFOV in term or near term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient information on the use of rescue HFOV to make recommendations for practice. The small amount of data that exists suggest that harm might outweigh any benefit. For every six infants who are treated with rescue HFOV rather than CV, one case of pulmonary air leak of any type would be prevented and one case of IVH of any grade would be caused.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Any future use of HFOV as rescue therapy for preterm infants with severe RDS should be within randomised controlled trials and address important outcomes such as longer term pulmonary and neurological function.</P>
