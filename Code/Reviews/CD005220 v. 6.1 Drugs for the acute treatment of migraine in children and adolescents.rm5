<B>Background and review question</B>
</P>
<P>Migraine is a painful and debilitating disorder that is common in children (under 12 years of age) and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age). Common symptoms reported during a migraine attack are headache, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Many treatments for migraine are available, of which the most common are paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatories, and triptans. Not all triptan medications are approved for use in children or adolescents, and approvals vary from country to country.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In our review, we looked at 27 randomized controlled trials of drugs compared to placebo to find out which treatments were effective at providing pain freedom two hours after treatment. We also wanted to know what side effects might be caused by the treatments. A total of 7630 children received medication in the studies. The evidence is current to February 2016. Each study had between 13 and 888 participants. Their average age was 12.9 years and ranged from 8.2 to 14.7 years. Nineteen of the studies were funded by the drug manufacturer.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Ibuprofen appears to be effective in treating children with migraine, but the evidence is limited to only two small trials. Ibuprofen is readily available and inexpensive, making it an excellent first choice for migraine treatment. Paracetamol was not shown to be effective in providing pain freedom in children, but we only found one small study. Triptans are a type of medication designed specifically to treat migraine and are often effective at providing greater pain freedom in children and adolescents. The triptans examined in children included rizatriptan and sumatriptan, while almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan were examined in adolescents. The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium is also effective at treating adolescents with migraine. Overall, there is a risk that the triptan medications may cause minor unwanted side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting. The studies did not report any serious side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence provided by the review was moderate for the triptans, but low for paracetamol and ibuprofen, as we only identified a few studies. More studies need to look at the effects of each of the migraine treatments in children and adolescents separately.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-04 17:13:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts and reviewed the full text of potentially eligible studies. Two independent reviewers extracted data for studies meeting inclusion criteria. We calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for dichotomous data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for proportions of adverse events. The percentage of pain-free patients at two hours was the primary efficacy outcome measure. We used adverse events to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome measures included headache relief, use of rescue medication, headache recurrence, presence of nausea, and presence of vomiting. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-08 22:50:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified a total of 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of migraine symptom-relieving medications, in which 9158 children and adolescents were enrolled and 7630 (range of mean age between 8.2 and 14.7 years) received medication. Twenty-four studies focused on drugs in the triptan class, including almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, sumatriptan + naproxen sodium, and zolmitriptan. Other medications studied included paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, and dihydroergotamine (DHE). More than half of the studies evaluated sumatriptan. All but one study reported adverse event data. Most studies presented a low or unclear risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence, according to GRADE criteria, was low to moderate, downgraded mostly due to imprecision and inconsistency. Ibuprofen was more effective than placebo for producing pain freedom at two hours in two small studies that included 162 children (RR 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 3.04) with low quality evidence (due to imprecision). Paracetamol was not superior to placebo in one small study of 80 children. Triptans as a class of medication were superior to placebo in producing pain freedom in 3 studies involving 273 children (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.62, NNTB 13) (moderate quality evidence) and 21 studies involving 7026 adolescents (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.47, NNTB 6) (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the effect sizes between studies involving children versus adolescents. Triptans were associated with an increased risk of minor (non-serious) adverse events in adolescents (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.18, NNTH 8), but studies did not report any serious adverse events. The risk of minor adverse events was not significant in children (RD 0.06, 95% CI &#8722; 0.04 to 0.17, NNTH 17). Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium was superior to placebo in one study involving 490 adolescents (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.78 to 5.94, NNTB 6) (moderate quality evidence). Oral dihydroergotamine was not superior to placebo in one small study involving 13 children.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 19:03:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low quality evidence from two small trials shows that ibuprofen appears to improve pain freedom for the acute treatment of children with migraine. We have only limited information on adverse events associated with ibuprofen in the trials included in this review. Triptans as a class are also effective at providing pain freedom in children and adolescents but are associated with higher rates of minor adverse events. Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium is also effective in treating adolescents with migraine.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-14 13:19:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Migraine is a common and disabling disease, affecting 3% to 10% of children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Stovner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovner 2007</LINK>). Children as young as two years of age may be affected, and most adults with migraine have their first headache in early childhood or adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Bille-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bille 1997</LINK>). Quality-of-life studies indicate that migraine has a significant negative impact on a child (<LINK REF="REF-Powers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 2004</LINK>). Indeed, migraines can be a tremendous source of anxiety for children, adolescents, and their parents, disrupting both school obligations and parental work responsibilities. These concerns may be amplified when there is uncertainty on the physician's part as to the best treatment.</P>
<P>The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3<SUP>rd</SUP> edition, beta version (<LINK REF="REF-ICHD_x002d_3-beta" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICHD-3 beta</LINK>), provides the most accepted and current definition of migraine. The presence of headache, often associated with nausea, vomiting, or both is common to adults, adolescents, and children with migraine. However, the criteria acknowledge that children and adolescents' migraines may be shorter but will last at least two hours, and the pain may be bilateral over the frontotemporal head regions or non-pulsatile. Adolescents, like adults, will usually begin to report unilateral pulsatile pain. The presence of photophobia and phonophobia may need to be inferred from behaviour such as a preference for a quiet and dimly lit room during a migraine attack.</P>
<P>Treatments for migraine include symptom-relieving and preventive strategies. Preventive medications are used to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Symptom-relieving therapies commonly aim to eliminate head pain and reduce the symptoms associated with migraine, including nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia. Oral analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are the mainstay of acute therapy for migraine in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00e4_m_x00e4_l_x00e4_inen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hämäläinen 2002</LINK>). However, other agents such as ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine) and the serotonin 1b/1d receptor agonists (triptans) have demonstrated efficacy in adults. Many of these medications have now been studied in children and adolescents, and some are approved for use in the pediatric age group. A practice parameter on this topic has been published by the American Academy of Neurology Quality Standards Subcommittee and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>). This systematic review will summarize and update the evidence base and provide a meta-analysis of the data.</P>

<P>We included all prospective, placebo-controlled trials of pharmacological interventions for symptomatic or acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents in the outpatient setting if allocation to treatment groups was randomized (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). We included studies regardless of design (i.e. parallel-group or cross-over), publication status, or language of publication. We included cross-over studies, as migraine is an episodic disorder, and we did not expect any carry-over or period effects (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). We excluded non-placebo-controlled studies, concurrent cohort comparisons and other quasi- or non-experimental designs.</P>

<P>We included studies involving pediatric participants 17 years of age or less with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura. For the purposes of the review, we defined children as under 12 years of age and adolescents as 12 to 17 years of age (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). We recorded inclusion age criteria, including median and mean age of subjects. We excluded studies involving both pediatric and adult patients unless they reported results separately for the pediatric patients. We analyzed separately the data from studies that included both children and adolescents when possible. If studies did not report the data separately, we used the mean age as a surrogate. If the mean age in the study was less than 12 years, we considered the study population to be of predominantly childhood age. If the mean age was greater than or equal to 12 years, we considered the study population to be of predominantly adolescent age.</P>
<P>Migraine is defined by clinical symptoms and signs in the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, beta version (<LINK REF="REF-ICHD_x002d_3-beta" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICHD-3 beta</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-ICHD_x002d_3-beta" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICHD-3 beta</LINK> includes revised comments for the diagnosis of migraine in children and adolescents, including shorter duration of headache (2 to 72 hours), bilateral frontotemporal location, and the presence of photophobia and phonophobia as inferred from behaviour. There have been two other versions of the International Classification of Headache Disorder and a proposed revision of the 1988 criteria in the context of children or adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICHD_x002d_2" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICHD-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winner 1995</LINK>). We included a study in this review if investigators used any version of the International Headache Society classification systems above or the proposed revision for pediatrics for the diagnosis of migraine with or without aura.</P>

<P>We included studies allocating participants to receive a pharmacological intervention by any route of administration for symptomatic acute treatment of a migraine attack.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2016-04-08 21:06:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We chose outcomes to assess both efficacy and safety. We selected the primary efficacy outcome based on the suggested guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>). The primary outcome for safety was based on the report of adverse events. All outcome measures were reported for the treatment of a single attack (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2016-04-08 21:06:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the percentage of pain-free participants at two hours; we defined pain freedom as the absence of pain at two hours before the use of additional or rescue medication (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). Headache relief is a frequently used primary outcome measure that is variably defined based on the scale used to assess pain. For example, if using the four level scale of none, mild, moderate, or severe pain, investigators or physicians may define headache relief as a decrease in pain from moderate or severe to mild or none. Some in the migraine research community have challenged the use of headache relief as a primary outcome measure; for example, migraine sufferers generally do not consider headache relief a success and expect pain freedom from an intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 2002</LINK>). Given these considerations, we classified headache relief as a secondary outcome measure (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
<P>We used the percentage of participants with any adverse event(s) as the primary safety outcome measure, and this was required for inclusion in the analysis (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). We defined adverse events as any unwanted effect that occurred during treatment. We also documented the proportion of participants reporting any serious adverse events when possible. Serious adverse events included death, any life-threatening condition, hospitalization, disability or permanent damage, required intervention to prevent permanent damage, or any other important medical event that could jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention.</P>
<P>Some aspects of the original protocol were not necessary to implement given the way studies reported outcome data. We document these considerations in the <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK> section.</P>

<P>We assessed the following secondary outcome measures.<BR/>

<UL>
<LI>Headache relief (headache response): the percentage of participants with headache relief at two hours is typically defined as a decrease in headache intensity from severe or moderate to mild or none at two hours prior to the use of rescue medication. When studies used alternate definitions of pain intensity (e.g. numerical scale), they needed to describe a level of relief that would be meaningful to a participant and to reflect a decrease in headache intensity similar to that assumed in the above definition.</LI>
<LI>Rescue medication: the percentage of participants taking rescue medication at two hours or earlier to a maximum of six hours after the test drug. The definition of rescue medication was variable and often included any use of medication to treat the recurrence of headache within a specified timeframe (i.e. usually 24 hours). For the purposes of the review, rescue medication was defined as the use of any medication between 2 and 24 hours.</LI>
<LI>Headache recurrence: the percentage of participants who were initially pain-free or achieved the study primary outcome of headache relief within 2 hours without the use of rescue medication but who experienced recurrence of any headache from 2 to 48 hours.</LI>
<LI>Presence of nausea: percentage of participants with nausea at two hours after taking the test drug.</LI>

For adverse events, we combined data combined using RDs with 95% CIs.

Paired analysis was not possible for any of the included studies (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). This method of including cross-over studies will tend to produce wider confidence intervals and is considered a more conservative assessment of treatment effect given that these studies will receive a lower weight in the meta-analyses.

The doses of sumatriptan + naproxen sodium, respectively, were 10 mg + 60 mg (N = 96), 30 mg + 180 mg (N = 97), and 85 mg + 500 mg (N = 152). The primary outcome reported was pain freedom at two hours, with data adjusted for age and baseline severity. The adjusted pain-free rates at two hours were higher with sumatriptan + naproxen sodium 10 mg + 60 mg (29%; adjusted P = 0.003), 30 mg + 180 mg (27%; adjusted P = 0.003), and 85 mg + 500 mg (24%; adjusted P = 0.003) versus placebo (10%). Post hoc analyses showed no differences among the 3 doses or an age-by-treatment interaction. Calculating the RR for pain relief at 2 hours, sumatriptan + naproxen sodium was superior to placebo with an RR of 3.25 (95% CI 1.78 to 5.94) and NNTB of 6. The use of rescue medication was also significantly reduced with the combination medication when compared with placebo (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.64), but investigators did not report headache relief.

However, the difference was not statistically significant when comparing oral versus intranasal sumatriptan studies (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). The permitted concomitant use of migraine preventive medications in the triptan trials among adolescents was not associated with any significant difference in the effect size (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).

<P>Ibuprofen was more effective than placebo in producing pain freedom in two small studies involving children.

While ibuprofen as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) may have some advantage in the treatment of a migraine attack, considering the presence of neurogenic inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2008</LINK>), it was not superior to zolmitriptan or paracetamol in two three-way cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Evers-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Evers 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e4_m_x00e4_l_x00e4_inen-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Hämäläinen 1997a</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Triptans</HEADING>
<P>Triptans as a class of medication were more effective than placebo in producing pain freedom in 3 studies involving children and 21 studies involving adolescents. We did not observe any significant differences in the effect sizes between the subgroups of individual triptans, including almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or zolmitriptan. While there was some evidence to suggest that intranasal preparations of sumatriptan and zolmitriptan produce higher effect sizes than oral preparations of all the triptans listed above, the evidence was inconsistent. Evidence for the efficacy of the triptans was variable, as measured through the secondary outcomes of headache relief, use of rescue medication, headache recurrence, presence of nausea, and presence of vomiting, but in general it favored the triptans. The efficacy, however, is counterbalanced with an increased risk of minor (non-serious) adverse events overall. However, there were no serious adverse events reported. Commonly reported adverse events included fatigue, dizziness, asthenia, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting with oral preparations, and taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, and nausea with intranasal preparations. The combination of sumatriptan with naproxen sodium was also more effective than placebo in producing pain freedom in one adolescent study. We did not observe any significant differences in the effect sizes between studies that included children versus adolescents. The only significant study characteristic that was associated with a higher effect size was the use of a cross-over design versus parallel group design.</P>

Pharmaceutical companies sponsored most of the triptan studies (N = 19).

<P>We judged the quality of evidence for the effect of triptans on pain relief to be moderate, having downgraded it due to serious inconsistency in adolescents and imprecision in children (small sample size, few events, and wide confidence intervals. For ibuprofen, we downgraded the quality of the evidence by two levels to low due to very serious imprecision (small sample size, few events, and wide confidence intervals). It is likely that future research will help to tighten the confidence intervals around the effect size of the above medications. More evidence is needed to assess the effect of paracetamol in children and adolescents.

<P>A number of similar systematic reviews have been published. The review by <LINK REF="REF-Major-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Major 2003</LINK> of triptan studies in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years concluded that intranasal sumatriptan was effective, while other oral triptans were not. The American Academy of Neurology Quality Standards Subcommittee and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society have published a practice parameter on the pharmacological treatment of migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>). Our conclusions are similar with regard to the evidence for efficacy of ibuprofen in children but differ with regard to the efficacy of paracetamol. The practice parameter also concluded that sumatriptan nasal spray was effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adolescents. <LINK REF="REF-Damen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damen 2005</LINK> evaluated all randomized controlled trials for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age but identified a smaller number of trials (10 studies). The authors performed a meta-analysis, and concluded there was evidence for the use of ibuprofen, paracetamol, and intranasal sumatriptan. <LINK REF="REF-Silver-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 2008</LINK> also included all medications for the acute treatment of migraine in their search, but identified only 11 studies in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The authors concluded that there was evidence only for the use of ibuprofen and sumatriptan and did not differentiate between oral and intranasal sumatriptan preparations. A meta-analysis and qualitative review of ibuprofen and paracetamol in adults, adolescents, and children concluded that ibuprofen was at least as efficacious as paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Pierce-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Eiland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eiland 2010</LINK> recommended the triptan class as an acute treatment option for children and adolescents with migraines, also concluding that there was evidence to recommend sumatriptan and zolmitriptan nasal sprays as well as rizatriptan or almotriptan tablets over the other triptans. <LINK REF="REF-Vollono-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vollono 2011</LINK> examined 11 studies and concluded that triptans are an important option in the symptomatic treatment of childhood and adolescent migraine. Individually, they found that zolmitriptan and rizatriptan were superior to placebo in most studies, and almotriptan was well tolerated. <LINK REF="REF-Toldo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toldo 2012</LINK> recommended paracetamol and ibuprofen as first line treatments for migraine in children and adolescents. The triptans were deemed safe, and the authors concluded that sumatriptan nasal spray was more effective than placebo and that zolmitriptan nasal spray and rizatriptan tablets were likely effective. <LINK REF="REF-W_x00f6_ber_x002d_Bing_x00f6_l-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wöber-Bingöl 2013</LINK> examined 14 studies on triptans in adolescents and 6 studies in children and concluded that evidence for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine in children was poor, but evidence for adolescents was better, albeit still limited. The authors outlined that sumatriptan nasal spray and zolmitriptan nasal spray were approved for adolescents in Europe; while in the United States almotriptan can be used for adolescents and rizatriptan is approved for patients aged 6 to 17 years. The combination of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium in adolescents has also since been approved for use in adolescents in the United States. <LINK REF="REF-Bonfert-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonfert 2013</LINK> included 33 studies examining acute and preventive treatment for migraine and tension-type headaches. The reviewers did not conduct a meta-analysis but reviewed the individual studies, concluding that ibuprofen and paracetamol should be considered first and second line therapies for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents, with almotriptan and rizatriptan as suitable third-line agents.</P>
<P>Finally, a recent review identified only seven studies in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and concluded that enrichment designs significantly reduced placebo response (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2013</LINK>). Our review includes a higher number of studies (N = 27), including negative studies published only in pharmaceutical-industry sponsored trial registries. We draw similar conclusions with regard to the benefit and safety of ibuprofen in treating children and adolescents with migraine. As with previous reviews, the low cost, broad availability, and safety may make ibuprofen a preferred first choice. We differ however in our conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to recommend paracetamol. In general our conclusions are similar with regard to the triptans as a class of medication being effective in the treatment of children and adolescents with migraine. We differ in that we found insufficient evidence to recommend one triptan over the others in our meta-analysis and sub-group analyses. While rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan were statistically superior to placebo as subgroups, the overall test for subgroup heterogeneity was not significant. In our meta-analysis, we combined the studies of triptan medications irrespective of route of delivery and dosage.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-08 21:19:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found low quality evidence from two small studies that ibuprofen appears to improve pain relief in children with migraine. We have only limited information on adverse events in the trials included in this review. There is insufficient evidence in favor of paracetamol. We did not identify evidence regarding early treatment, the use of other NSAIDs, or the combination of these analgesics with other medications (e.g. metoclopramide, caffeine) in children or adolescents.</P>
<P>For children and adolescents with migraine, triptans appear to be effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium is effective in adolescents, but we did not find any studies in children. Triptans are generally safe but carry an increased risk of minor (non-serious) adverse events.</P>
<P>For clinicians, the choice of triptan medication may be guided by factors such as patient preference, route of delivery, or palatability. A parent who responds well to one of the medications may be more likely to request that medication for their child. More than half of the triptan studies in children and adolescents were of sumatriptan, and this medication serves as the reference drug in this class. The choice of triptan may also be based on local availability, drug cost reimbursement, and regulatory approval. We found inconsistent evidence in our subgroup analysis of the intranasal versus oral triptan preparations, but patients may prefer one route over the other (e.g. intranasal if significant vomiting or oral if patient has chronic rhinitis).</P>
<P>For policymakers and funders, the triptan class of medications, as well as sumatriptan in combination with naproxen sodium, are suitable options for children and adolescents with migraine.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>Future studies should separate the childhood and adolescent age groups to enable separate meta-analyses of these groups. More studies of simple analgesics commonly used in the treatment of migraine like paracetamol and ibuprofen, other NSAIDs, or head to head comparisons are warranted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>Studies employing a cross-over design were associated with significantly higher effect size estimates. Similar findings have been reported previously (<LINK REF="REF-Lathyris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lathyris 2007</LINK>). This may have been due to inadequate blinding in cross-over studies or higher effect estimates due to the smaller sample size. Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine advocate the use of either cross-over or parallel design (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement (endpoints)</HEADING>
<P>Pain freedom as an outcome measure demonstrated low heterogeneity between studies and may be most suitable as a primary outcome measure. Data on other outcome measures (e.g. nausea, headache relief, etc.) should also be collected, as described in the guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>).</P>

<LI>At the recommendation of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group, we narrowed the review criteria to include only placebo-controlled trials. We did not include studies with active comparators or standard of care as the control.</LI>
<LI>The original protocol outlined a plan to address possible carry-over and period effects in studies of cross-over design. Given that migraine is an episodic disorder and that interventions were used to treat discrete migraine episodes, we considered the probability of there being carry-over and period effects to be very low. Thus, we deemed it inappropriate to exclude studies of cross-over design as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. We included all studies of cross-over design even if they did not report the time between treatment periods or a statistical test for carry-over effect. We performed a sensitivity analysis on study design to assess the influence of cross-over studies on measures of effect and harm.</LI>
<LI>We changed the allowed ages from the range of 3 to 18 years to any age under 18. For the subgroup analysis, we defined age groups according to custom in these types of studies (i.e. children less than 12 years of age; adolescents 12 to 17 years), as these age groups represent distinct ages whereby treatment may differ. No minimum age was included, as the diagnosis of migraine using appropriate criteria will preclude diagnosis in the very young, in whom criteria are not met.</LI>
<LI>All studies reported the treatment of a single attack. The original protocol outlined a plan to address studies that reported the treatment of multiple headache episodes, but it was not necessary to implement this. If required, we will apply this plan in future revisions of the study.</LI>
<LI>We added 'pain-free' as the primary outcome measure, given that it is a recommended primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>), it is the most desirable outcome for patients, and most studies report it.</LI>
<LI>We changed 'headache relief' from a primary to a secondary outcome measure.</LI>
<LI>No studies reported ordinal outcomes, continuous outcomes, or group mean change scores. Thus, we did not implement these aspects of the protocol, but we will if required in future revisions of the review.</LI>
<LI>We removed photophobia and phonophobia from secondary outcome measures as recommended by reviewers and often only inferred from behaviour.</LI>
<LI>We removed patient preference for treatment as a secondary outcome measure.</LI>
<LI>We did not include assessment time points beyond two hours post medication administration given the known relatively short duration of migraine in many children and adolescents.</LI>
<LI>We included a primary outcome measure to assess harm (i.e. any adverse events), as per the updated version 5.1.0 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We revised the search strategy to improve search terms and focus on pharmacological interventions.</LI>
<LI>We did not include a high versus low methodological quality score based on the Jadad scale in the sensitivity analysis, as we used the 'Risk of bias' tables to assess methodological quality. We used allocation concealment as per the protocol, as it is one of the domains in the 'Risk of bias' assessment.</LI>
<LI>We added the GRADE assessment of quality of evidence.</LI>
<LI>The original protocol proposed calculating within-patient improvement scores whenever the required data were reported, but these were not available.</LI>
<LI>We added reports in a peer-reviewed indexed journal to the sensitivity analysis.</LI>
<LI>We did not identify or include any quasi-randomized studies in the review. Future revisions of the review would not benefit from their inclusion, so we removed this selection criterion as suggested by reviewers.</LI>
<LI>We amended the title from "Drugs for treating acute migraine headaches in children and adolescents" to "Drugs for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents" for clarity.</LI>
