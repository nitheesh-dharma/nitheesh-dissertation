<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-29 09:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Paclitaxel is derived from Yews (a type of tree), and can be used to treat for several cancers such as lung, womb, ovary and breast. It was initially given by a long infusion (injection) over 24 hours, with premedication to avoid any allergic reactions. It was also thought this method would be more active against tumours. Six randomised trials were included in this review, which found that short (three hour) infusions are more convenient and caused significantly fewer adverse (side) effects (i.e. decreased white blood cell counts, fever, infection or sore mouth). With short-infusion paclitaxel there is no obvious loss of effectiveness when compared with longer infusions, although further clinical trials are needed to be sure of this.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-28 15:16:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Paclitaxel has become a standard drug used in a number of common cancers. At first long infusions were used to reduce the rate of inflow of the drug and as a result reduce the occurrence of hypersensitivity types of allergic reactions. Trials with shorter durations of infusion, and using a cocktail of anti-allergic drugs to prevent hypersensitivity reactions, some randomised, were begun. These were interpreted as showing that effectiveness of treatment was not lessened by a short infusion time. These studies also appeared to show that some important toxicities were less common with short infusions and that they were more convenient for the patient and the hospital.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-12-02 14:53:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness and toxicity of short versus long infusions of paclitaxel for any advanced adenocarcinoma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-03 13:45:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Review Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 1, 2009, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to March 2009. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field, as well as drug companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-03-29 13:10:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The review was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single agent paclitaxel or paclitaxel with other drugs, where the only variable was the duration of paclitaxel infusion. The review only includes patients with advanced adenocarcinoma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-04-07 12:28:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible the data were synthesised in meta-analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 09:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We identified six trials that met our inclusion criteria. The trials compared 3, 24 and 96 hour infusions and one trial examined different schedules (1 versus 3 day). From the included RCTs we found no evidence of a difference between short and long infusions in terms of overall and progression-free survival and tumour non-response. In most cases a greater proportion of adverse events and severe toxicity occurred in the 24 hour infusion group compared to the 3 hour group with many of the analyses being highly statistically significant (RR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.22, 0.47, RR = 0.06, 95% CI 0.02, 0.17, RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.40, 0.88, RR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.28, 0.97 for severe hypersensitivity, febrile neutropenia, sore mouth and diarrhoea outcomes respectively). Although a meta analysis of three trials found that 3 hour infusions were associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of neurosensory changes compared with 24 hour infusions (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46). Adverses events were not comprehensively reported for any of the other comparisons. Outcomes were incompletely documented and QoL outcomes were not reported in any of the trials. The strength of the evidence is weak in this review as it is based on meta analyses of very few trials or single trial analyses and all trials were at moderate risk of bias and two were published in abstract form only.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-03-24 10:45:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Ideally, large, multi-centre supporting trials are needed as outcomes were incompletely reported in included trials in this review. It may be beneficial to design a multi-arm trial comparing 3, 24 and 96 hour infusions or maybe looking at different schedules. In the absence of such trials, the decision to offer short or long infusions in advanced adenocarcinoma may need to be individualised, although it certainly appears that women have less toxicity, apart from sensory nerve damage, with a shorter infusion. Efficacy appearing similar regardless of infusion duration.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-11 11:09:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Paclitaxel, a natural product of Yew trees, is an important drug in the management of cancer. It has an established first-line role in the management of a number of cancers (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 1996</LINK>). During the initial development of the drug (phase I studies to find an appropriate dose of the drug) a variety of different doses and schedules were used. When phase II trials began to look for anti-cancer activity these were required by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) to use long infusion times (24 hours) because of the perceived increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions when paclitaxel was given by short infusions (3 hours or less) (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK>). All infusions were also given with premedication designed to further reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Initial results from early studies had, however, shown that short infusion times were associated with reduced toxicity to white blood cells, without apparent reduction in anti-cancer activity (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK>). Theoretically, a long duration of infusion might be expected to be associated with greater anti-tumour activity (<LINK REF="STD-Huizing-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Huizing 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subsequently it was felt that it was likely to be safe to use short infusions of paclitaxel provided that it was given with premedication using a combination of three drugs to reduce the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. A number of randomised clinical trials have compared the effectiveness and toxicity of short versus long infusion times (both with premedication). In general these have been interpreted as showing equal anti-cancer effectiveness with both long and short infusions and a smaller fall in the white blood count with shorter infusions. Short infusions were also more convenient to all concerned.</P>
<P>Since paclitaxel is an important relatively new anticancer drug, definitive information on the effect of varying the duration of infusion is required as this might alter how effective it is at controlling cancer.</P>
<P>In addition to hypersensitivity reactions, paclitaxel commonly causes side-effects which can limit its use. These include bone marrow suppression, hair loss, tiredness, nausea and vomiting, muscle pains and damage to nerves that mainly effects sensation. These toxic effects might also vary according to the duration of paclitaxel infusion.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-03-24 10:59:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To assess the effectiveness and toxicity of short versus long infusions of paclitaxel for any advanced adenocarcinoma. The null hypothesis tested was that infusions of long or short duration have the same effects on efficacy and toxicity.</P>

<P>The original search strategy identified 1879 unique references. The title and abstract screening of these references identified four trials as potentially eligible for this review. The updated search strategy identified 392 references in the Specialised Register, 392 in CENTRAL, 869 in MEDLINE and 1069 in EMBASE. When the search results were merged into Endnote and duplicates were removed there were 2139 unique references. The title and abstract screening of these references identified 19 studies as potentially eligible for the review. A number of other randomised trials were excluded at the first sift stage because the chemotherapy drugs and/or doses were not the same in both arms. One potentially eligible trial (in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Sulkes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkes 1994</LINK>)) was excluded as some of the patients were probably included in another report (<LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK>) and there were no outcome data. Overall, the full text screening of these 19 studies excluded 14 for the reasons described in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Eisenhauer 1994</HEADING>
<P>The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK> was a 2 x 2 factorial trial which randomised 407 women with ovarian cancer to either 3 or 24 hour paclitaxel infusions and to either a 135 mg/ m2 or 175 mg/ m2 dose of paclitaxel with 391 (96%) patients eligible and assessable for toxicity and 382 (94%) were eligible for response. Each of the two sets of factorial groups was well balanced with respect to most characteristics, apart from the proportion of patients who had progressed on their most recent chemotherapy regime. This was higher in the 3-hour group than the 24-hour group. The way that toxicity was reported varied according to the type of toxicity (platelets: grade IV, white cells: grade III or greater and others any grade or undefined). There were worries over hypersensitivity reactions at the time so these are given prominence. Patients in the trial did not routinely receive colony stimulating factors. Follow-up duration was short when this trial was reported, though many relapses and deaths occurred in the first year.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Peretz 1995</HEADING>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK>, 521 patients with relapsed breast cancer were randomised to 3 or 24 hour infusions of 175mg/ m2 paclitaxel as a single agent. Data for all end points are reported in this study. Data available for this trial was in abstract only and lacked detail. The total number of eligible patients was presented, but the number randomised to each arm was not given. Attempts to get further information from the lead author of the abstract and Bristol-Myers Squibb failed. A published abstract was also found giving details of Israeli experience of 3 and 24 hour infusions in both breast and ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Sulkes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkes 1994</LINK>). It seems likely that the breast cancer patients were included in the <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> trial, although there is no cross reference to confirm this. In addition no data on outcomes were presented, so <LINK REF="STD-Sulkes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkes 1994</LINK> was not included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> compared the paclitaxel dose described above every 21 days in women with advanced, usually previously treated, breast cancer. Dose escalation was allowed in both arms. Two-thirds of patients were pretreated with anthracyclines, 24% being resistant to anthracyclines. Colony stimulating factors were not routinely used in either arm, but more patients in the 3 hour arm had dose escalations (65% versus 34%, P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>The method of collecting toxicity data was not defined and the scales used were also undefined though it seems likely that they are four point scales. The criteria for response are undefined and it is not clear whether there was independent assessment of response. Full details on the eligibility of patients is not available. Data on time to progression is available, but there were no data on OS.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Smith 1999</HEADING>
<P>The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK> randomised 563 women with breast cancer to either 3 or 24 hour infusions of high-dose paclitaxel (250 mg/ m2). In this study, patients receiving the longer duration infusion were given prophylactic G-CSF, designed to stop the white blood cell count falling, in an attempt to reduce the risk of infection in patients with a low granulocyte count. Patients receiving the shorter infusion of paclitaxel received G-CSF only if they had such an episode of infection. Data from this trial could be used for all of the end points of the review apart from that of white cell toxicity and infection. Data on the effect of the different durations of infusion of paclitaxel on white cells could have been misleading because of the different polices regarding the use of G-CSF in the two trial arms.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial comparing 3 versus 96 hour infusions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Holmes 1998</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1998</LINK> trial planned to accrue 226 eligible patients with measurable-evaluable metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but it was unclear how many were actually randomised or analysed when the results were presented. The trial is reported in abstract form only and lacked any sort of detail. Women were randomised to receive either paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 for 3 hour infusions or 140 mg/m2 for 96 hour infusions repeated every 21 days. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added only if women experienced neutropenic fever or infection then dose-reduction. Patients with MBC were stratified by (1) doxorubicin-sensitivity (doxorubicin-resistant: progression during treatment for MBC or within 6 months after adjuvant doxorubicin) and (2) number of prior regimens (inclusive of adjuvant: 0 or 1 versus 2 or 3).</P>
<P>We attempted to get further information from the lead author of the abstract but as of March 2011 there was no response. The abstract concluded that there was no significant difference in overall response (OR), duration or survival and that OR was low (possibly due to stringent OR requirements (20% metabolic response) and the fact the trial was a multicenter trial). Toxicity was evaluable in 123 patients treated from March 1994 to October 1995 (data not shown). The trial reported that the 96 hour arm had fewer toxic effects, but that this was less convenient. Furthermore, they added that these data do not justify the extra logistical support required for 96 hour infusion.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK> trial randomised 56 women with advanced cancer, either resistant or refractory, to initial standard therapy or with an untreated primarily resistant tumour type. Before randomisation, patients were stratified according to performance status, primary disease site, and previous chemotherapy. The trial included 17 (30.50%) women with breast cancer, 16 (28.5%) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), nine (16%) with ovarian cancer, five (9%) with small cell lung cancer and nine (16%) women had other cancer types. Paclitaxel was infused as a single dose of 135 mg/m2 over 1 hour or divided into 3 doses infused over 1 hour on 3 consecutive days. There was no dose escalation and patients did not receive prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK> trial randomised 293 women (of which 280 were eligible) with sub-optimal stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The trial regimens were allocated from randomly permuted blocks of treatments with an equal number of each study treatment within each block. The trial included 92 (33%) women with performance status of 0, 155 (55%) with a status of 1 and 33 (12%) women had a status of 2. Women received six cycles of cisplatin and either paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 during 24 hours or paclitaxel 120mg/m2 during 96 hours. Colony stimulating factors were not routinely used in either arm and there were no dose escalations.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Two trials reported OS and three reported PFS. We estimated the HR for OS and PFS for the comparison of 3 versus 24 hour infusions in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK> and the HR for PFS in the <LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK> trial. We extracted the exact log rank P-value from the Kaplan-Meier plots and the total number of reported deaths and cases of progression in each group and used the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK> that compared 24 versus 96 hour infusions explicitly reported adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS and PFS.</P>
<P>The HR for OS and PFS in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK> was adjusted for: initial measurable disease status (present versus absent), performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2), histology (clear cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma versus other cell types), and stage of disease (III versus IV).</P>
<P>For the distribution of these factors at baseline for each trial by treatment arm see the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Overall tumour response was reported in all five trials. Specific time points at which this was assessed was not reported in any of the trials, but the range of cycle length of chemotherapy was mentioned. Most trials reported a range of cycles of between one and eight, with most trials reporting up to six cycles. The majority of cycles given were three weekly. We analysed in terms of tumour non-response rather than tumour response, so that there was a consistent reference group and RRs favouring 3 hour (3 versus 24 hour comparison) and 24 hour (24 versus 96 hour comparison) infusions were consistently on the left of the line of no effect on the forest plots.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK>) reported acute toxicity in detail though the type of scale used was not described and different cut off points were used and information was frequently already combined by site or grade. Extracted data were grouped in the reported grades and pooled since toxicity is unlikely to be confounded by the tumour type. Late toxicity was not commented on in any of the trials. <LINK REF="REF-WHO" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO</LINK>.</P>
<P>Individual trials in this review did not report the type of toxicity scale used and each reported the data differently, apart from the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK> which used the ECOG and GOG scales respectively.

<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK>) reported the method of generation of the sequence of random numbers used to allocate women to treatment arms, but only the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK> reported concealment of this allocation sequence from patients and healthcare professionals involved in the trial. While the abstract of <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1998</LINK> did not provide details of the method of sequence generation, the authors did report that patients were randomised at a central data management office so concealment was likely to be adequate.

<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we were unable to estimate a RR for comparisons of treatments if one or both treatment groups experienced no events, as in the hypersensitivity outcome comparing 1 and 3 day infusion schedules. We did however compute the RR in <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> as the default continuity correction in RevMan for the 3 versus 24 hour comparison of women with febrile neutropenia in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK> was satisfactory. This was due to the percentage in the long duration arm being significantly higher than in the short duration arm, meaning that a small increment added to the zero count still adequately demonstrated the magnitude of the difference (0 out of 187 versus 24 out of 204 in the 3 hour and 24 hour groups respectively).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 09:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A number of observations can be made from the data from the individual trials. These can be considered under two headings, efficacy and toxicity:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Although the pooled data for infusions of 3 versus 24 hours are presented these should be interpreted with great caution since there is clinical heterogeneity and assumptions have been made in extracting the data for the <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> trial. There was no statistical heterogeneity. In none of the trials was there a striking advantage for one paclitaxel infusion duration over another in any of the measures of efficacy reported. However, where there were statistically significant advantages these favoured the longer infusion. Longer infusions of high dose paclitaxel in breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>) resulted in a significantly higher response rate, though there were no significant differences in event-free survival or OS. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> there was an insignificant difference in response rate, but there was a significantly longer survival for the 24 hour infusion, though this was lost when the data were adjusted for prognostic factors (details not given). The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK> is in a different tumour site (ovarian cancer) and response rates and median times to progression were not significantly different between the two arms. There was, however, an overall trend for women receiving three hour infusions of paclitaxel to have a longer PFS interval. In contrast, there was no evidence of a significant difference in OS between the two infusion durations.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK>) tested shorter infusions versus infusions of 3 or 4 days. The trials are very different in several ways. <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK> included a wide variety of tumour types and used a short single infusion and compared this with short infusions on three consecutive days. <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK> only included gynaecological cancers, but compares a 24 hour infusion with a 96 hour infusion. Duration of the infusion did not appear to have a significant effect on efficacy in the two trials, but doses varied between the different arms making any conclusion difficult. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1998</LINK> used a high dose of paclitaxel (250mg/M2) as a 3 hour infusion and compared this to 140mg/M2 as a 96 hour infusion. This trial has only been presented in abstract form and its conclusion, that there was no difference in efficacy cannot be substantiated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>There is an internal consistency in the results and the pooled data are probably more reliable as tumour type is unlikely to effect toxicity. Though the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK> cannot be used (there were different policies for the use of G-CSF in the two arms), the other two trials clearly show that shorter durations of paclitaxel infusions produced significantly less neutropenia and fewer episodes of febrile neutropenia, infection and sore mouth. This is shown despite the use of more dose escalations with the 3 hour infusion than the 24 hour arm in the <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> trial. Neurotoxicity, in contrast, was significantly less common in the 24 hour infusion arms. It is difficult to combine this data as it is presented separately as sensory and motor neuro-toxicity in the Smith trial and combined in the other two. It is not clear which grades are being presented in the <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> trial. All grades and three or greater are presented in the <LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK> trial. The incidence of hypersensitivity is not significantly different in the two infusion durations being tested in any of the trials. Other side effects appeared unaffected by the duration of the paclitaxel infusions.</P>
<P>There were no major reported differences in toxicity in the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK> for the comparisons of shorter infusions versus infusions of 3 or 4 days, but the different designs limit any conclusions. The data on a subset of patients is not presented in the <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1998</LINK> trial and it is not possible to tell how much less toxicity there may have been in the patients receiving the 96 hour infusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 09:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review appears to include all of the available randomised trials, but some of the evidence is only available in abstract form. The data is principally from trials sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Though initial trials of paclitaxel used 24 hour infusions, 3 hour infusions have become the commonly used standard. Definitive evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of longer versus shorter duration infusions are only likely to change current practice if there are major changes in outcomes with a particular infusion duration. The findings of this review confirm known differences in toxicity that are dependent on duration of infusion. There is no clear evidence between 3 hour versus 24 hour infusions in terms of overall and progression-free survival and tumour non-response. The data is from RCTs, but is applicable to a general population of women with ovarian cancer. There is no evidence that efficacy is different for 24 hour versus 96 hour infusions or 1 day versus 3 day treatments. However, there are insufficient data to make any reliable conclusions for these comparisons. The findings suggest that there is no rationale for changing the current practice of using three hour infusions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-04-11 11:13:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>The meta-analyses of the RCTs trials that have compared different duration of paclitaxel infusions should be interpreted with caution, since the trials were clinically heterogeneous. Some trials are confounded by variations in the dose of paclitaxel or other drugs rendering them un interpretable. The three trials that use the same dose of paclitaxel in both arms, are difficult to combine as two are in breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>) and one is in ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenhauer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenhauer 1994</LINK>). The two breast cancer trials use very different doses of paclitaxel. Meta-analysis of toxicity data is complicated by the use of different or unidentified toxicity scales and the presentation of data using different cut-off points on the scales. In addition, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>), had different policies for G-CSF use in the two arms of the trial.</P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis must remain speculative because of the potential problems of combining trials where different tumours and different chemotherapy doses are used. The failure to present the numbers of patients randomised to each arm of the <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> trial means that the results presented must in addition be an estimate. The clearest conclusion is that three hour infusions of paclitaxel are associated with a very much lower incidence of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and sore mouth than 24 hour infusions. This finding was well known, but is emphasised when the data from the two eligible trials are combined. Similarly, it has previously been accepted that 24 hour infusions of paclitaxel cause less nerve toxicity. This finding is confirmed in the synthesis of the data (though combining the data is complicated by different reporting methods). There is no clear evidence of differences in other side-effects associated with 3 or 24 hour infusions.</P>
<P>The tentative finding that the overall and primary tumour response rates were rather higher for 24 hour infusions is, however, more controversial. Data for OS, PFS and/or progression event-free survival do not show benefit for either duration of infusion. In contrast, there is some evidence that OS was slightly longer with a 24 hour infusion. The conventional view has been that there is no difference in the effectiveness of paclitaxel regardless of whether it is used as an infusion given over 3 or 24 hours. The data in this review suggest that the question remains open. While no claim can be made that the anti-tumour effectiveness of a 24 hour infusion is greater than a 3 hour infusion, the review shows that the effect of longer infusion duration on effectiveness requires further data. At the very least, data from the <LINK REF="STD-Peretz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peretz 1995</LINK> trial should be made available for inclusion in an update of this review. From the data available, any difference in efficacy, if it exists, is likely to be modest and it may well require more patients than are included in the 3 eligible trials comparing 3 and 24 hour infusions to show a clear result.</P>
<P>The three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spriggs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spriggs 2007</LINK>) reporting the results of shorter infusion versus 3 or 4 day infusions cannot be reliably interpreted because of major differences in patient inclusion, different doses in the two arms, different total dose, and use of varying duration of infusion as well as a single infusion compared to three daily infusions</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-03-24 14:43:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature and all studies were sifted and data extracted by at least two reviewers independently. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as the analyses were restricted to meta-analyses of a small number of trials or single trials.</P>
<P>The reliability and interpretability of the review is reduced by the inclusion of different tumour types and different doses of paclitaxel. Analysis of toxicity data is effected by the use of different scales and cut points.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-03-29 09:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The overall conclusions of this review are in keeping with data from non-randomised phase two trials, though these have generally been small in size. The data from these RCTs are more reliable than any comparable non-randomised evidence.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-11 11:08:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-11 11:08:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>A short duration infusion such as a three hour infusion of paclitaxel is more convenient for patients, doctors and nurses and health care systems. There appears to be evidence that in general, short infusions cause less toxicity and have a lesser effect on white blood cells. This means that there is a lower risk of infection and need for hospital admission and also makes it easier to combine paclitaxel with other anti-cancer drugs.</P>
<P>From the included RCTs we found no evidence of a difference between short and long infusions in terms of survival. There was a non-significant increase in risk of the tumour not responding to treatment when shorter infusions were compared to longer ones. In most cases more adverse events and severe toxicity occurred in the longer infusion groups with many of the analyses being highly statistically significant. In the absence of QoL data and given the fact that there was no statistically significant differences in overall and progression-free survival or tumour response rates, it may be sensible to consider short infusions in favour of long infusions as patients would endure less toxicity. However, sensory nerve damage was more common in women receiving three hour infusions and this may be dose-limiting for some patients. In this review, comparisons were restricted to meta analyses of very few trials or single trial analyses and many included trials were of insufficient size. Therefore the decision to offer short or long infusions in advanced adenocarcinoma may need to be individualised. The uncertainty regarding any impact on survival should be discussed openly with the women.</P>
<P>Trials comparing shorter infusions with three or four day infusions showed no major differences in outcome, but cannot be relied on as there is major clinical heterogeneity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-29 09:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Updated data for all the six RCTs should be made available for a further systematic review. Ideally, large, multi-centre supporting trials need to be designed as outcomes were incompletely reported in included trials in this review. These trials should include a mixture of breast and ovarian cancer patients and should perform a thorough subgroup analysis within the trial. Outcomes such as overall and progression-free survival should be reported as well as other important outcomes such as tumour response, quality of life and severe adverse events and toxicity. It may be beneficial to design a multi-arm trial comparing 3, 24 and 96 hour infusions or maybe looking at different schedules as in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Greco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1995</LINK>. However, in the absence of more compelling evidence, it is unlikely that further large trials comparing different durations of infusion will be conducted. The current use of paclitaxel in combination with other drugs, means that the reduction in white cell toxicity associated with three hour infusions becomes a more important factor. The use of a 24 hour or other longer infusions may require dose reductions in paclitaxel or other drugs, and/or the use of G-CSF, in order to maintain acceptable toxicity. The published data on shorter infusions versus 3 or 4 days infusions does not appear to justify further research.</P>

<P>The following methods were specified in the protocol but not implemented as we found only six trials that met our inclusion criteria. None of the trials reported continuous outcomes such as quality of life or had multiple treatment groups. All trials were at high risk of bias so we did not conduct sensitivity analysis around quality. There was also a insufficient number of trials to assess the potential for small study effects such as publication bias.</P>
<P>The methods specified below may be required when a future update is carried out.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>For continuous outcomes (e.g. quality of life measures), we planned to extract the final value and standard deviation of the outcome of interest and the number of patients assessed at endpoint in each treatment arm at the end of follow-up, in order to estimate the mean difference between treatment arms and its standard error.</LI>

</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>Funnel plots corresponding to meta-analysis of the primary outcome were examined to assess the potential for small study effects such as publication bias. If these plots suggested that treatment effects may not be sampled from a symmetric distribution, as assumed by the random effects model, further meta-analyses were performed using fixed effects models.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>For continuous outcomes (e.g. QoL measures), the mean differences between the treatment arms at the end of follow-up will be pooled if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale, otherwise standardised mean difference will be pooled. </LI>
</UL>
<P>If any trials have multiple treatment groups, the &#8216;shared&#8217; comparison group will be divided into the number of treatment groups and comparisons between each treatment group and the split comparison group will be treated as independent comparisons.</P>
<P>If possible, studies making different comparisons will be synthesised using the sub-group methods of <LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1997</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We will perform sensitivity analyses, excluding studies which do not report adequate (i) concealment of allocation, (ii) blinding of the outcome assessor.</P>
