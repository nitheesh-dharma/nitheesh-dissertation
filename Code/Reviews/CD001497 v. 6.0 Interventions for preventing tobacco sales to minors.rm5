<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>If young people are unable to purchase cigarettes it may reduce the number who start to smoke. Various interventions including warnings and fines for retailers who illegally make sales to underage youth have been shown to reduce the proportion of retailers who are willing to sell tobacco during compliance checks. However it has been difficult to demonstrate a clear effect on young smokers' perceptions of how easily they can buy cigarettes, or on their smoking behaviour.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Laws restricting sales of tobacco products to minors exist in many countries, but young people may still purchase cigarettes easily.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The review assesses the effects of interventions to reduce underage access to tobacco by deterring shopkeepers from making illegal sales.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-04-16 14:24:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction group trials register, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Date of the most recent searches: April 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-08 15:10:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We included controlled trials and uncontrolled studies with pre- and post-intervention assessment of interventions to change retailers' behaviour. The outcomes were changes in retailer compliance with legislation (assessed by test purchasing), and changes in young people's smoking behaviour and their perceived ease of access to tobacco products.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were prescreened for relevance by one person and assessed for inclusion by two people independently. Data from included studies were extracted by one person and checked by a second. Study designs and types of intervention were heterogeneous so results were synthesised narratively, with greater weight given to controlled studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-06 15:50:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="L S">
<P>We identified 35 studies of which 14 had data from a control group for at least one outcome. Giving retailers information was less effective in reducing illegal sales than active enforcement and/or multicomponent educational strategies. No strategy achieved complete, sustained compliance. In three controlled trials, there was little effect of intervention on youth perceptions of access to tobacco products or prevalence of youth smoking.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Interventions with retailers can lead to large decreases in the number of outlets selling tobacco to youths. However, few of the communities studied in this review achieved sustained levels of high compliance. This may explain why there is limited evidence for an effect of intervention on youth perception of ease of access to tobacco, and on smoking behaviour.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-08 10:18:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Controlling access is an established strategy for reducing consumption of substances harmful to health, in particular tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs. A national survey in the USA in 1997 showed that of adolescents who try smoking, more than a third become daily smokers in secondary school (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 1998a</LINK>). Successful restriction of young people's access to tobacco products could help prevent them from developing this addiction. Accordingly, many countries prohibit tobacco sales to minors.</P>
<P>Although young people perceive difficulties in obtaining cigarettes as a deterrent to tobacco use (<LINK REF="REF-Stanton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanton 1993</LINK>), poor compliance with access laws is well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1998</LINK>). In most surveys in the past, underage young people report little difficulty when illegally purchasing cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanson-Fisher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanson Fisher 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erickson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MMWR-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 1996</LINK>). This situation may be changing; in the USA the Monitoring the Future survey for 2007 found that 78% of 10th-graders say they would find it 'fairly easy' or 'very easy' to get cigarettes, down from 91% in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2007</LINK>). In a 1997 survey, 30% of high school smokers reported cigarette purchase in the previous month, of whom less than a third had been asked for proof of age (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 1998b</LINK>). By 2005, of the 13% of students who had tried to buy cigarettes in a store in the previous 30 days, just over a half had been asked for proof of age (<LINK REF="REF-Eaton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaton 2006</LINK>). In England a 1996 survey suggested that 25% of all secondary school children had tried to buy cigarettes in a shop in the last year. Only 38% had been refused at least once (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1997</LINK>). In a New Zealand survey in 2002, 35% of underage smokers reported that their usual source of cigarettes was to purchase them from a shop, and 36% had not been refused in the previous month (<LINK REF="REF-Darling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darling 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, commercial sources of tobacco are not the only way in which young people obtain products (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emery-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>). They may also get cigarettes from parents, siblings, friends, and by theft. Reducing access to commercial sources could lead to increased use of such sources. In determining policy it is important to know both how best to restrict access, and the likely effect of successful restriction on youth tobacco consumption.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of reducing underage access to tobacco products by deterring shopkeepers from illegal sales. We asked three questions:<BR/>1. Does intervention with retailers, by education, active enforcement of laws, or combinations of strategies lead to decreased sales to minors? Is there evidence that any of the strategies is superior to the others?<BR/>2. Do reduced sales of tobacco to minors lead to a decrease in their self-reported ease of access?<BR/>3. Do reduced sales of tobacco to minors reduce prevalence of tobacco use?</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-05-08 15:17:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We considered studies of measures to improve compliance with laws restricting youth access to retail sales of tobacco, using one of these study designs:<BR/>1. Controlled trials randomizing retail outlets, communities or geographical regions.<BR/>2. Controlled trials without randomization allocating retail outlets, communities or geographical regions.<BR/>3. Time series studies.<BR/>4. Uncontrolled before and after studies.<BR/>We excluded uncontrolled studies with post-intervention measurements only.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We evaluated strategies which targeted retailers to reduce tobacco use by minors. Minors were defined by the legal age limit in the communities studied.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We considered education, law enforcement, community mobilisation, or combinations of strategies that aimed to deter retailers from selling tobacco to minors.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Illegal tobacco sales, assessed by attempted purchase by young people. <BR/>2. Perceived ease of access to cigarettes by young people.<BR/>3. Prevalence of tobacco use among young people. We accepted self reports of tobacco use.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 08:53:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We identified 35 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 used some form of control group. In six studies the store was the unit of randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santa-Clara-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Santa Clara 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chicago-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chicago 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harlem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Harlem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-South-Wales-1994" TYPE="STUDY">New South Wales 1994</LINK>). One (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1992</LINK>) identified the retailers who made illegal sales to minors at baseline. These retailers were then randomly allocated to receive a warning letter threatening prosecution, or no letter. One (<LINK REF="STD-Gateshead-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gateshead 1996</LINK>) carried out test purchasing around one school and not around another. Six studies compared interventions in different communities. Forster and colleagues' Tobacco Policy Options for Prevention study (<LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>) randomized 14 Minnesota communities after stratification on baseline variables. Altman and colleagues allocated two pairs of Monterey communities on the basis of a coin toss (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>). Cummings and colleagues assigned six matched pairs of communities to intervention or control status; within the intervention communities the stores were randomly allocated to different schedules of enforcement checks (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1995</LINK>). The other three community studies (<LINK REF="STD-San-Diego-1991" TYPE="STUDY">San Diego 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>) compared the intervention communities with a control community in which similar baseline and follow-up assessments were conducted, but without random assignment. In Massachusetts, intervention communities were those in which active enforcement of tobacco sales regulations was intended. The control communities were not planning active enforcement, although by the end of the study some enforcement was being conducted. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>) had no formal control area, but compared local smoking prevalence with state surveys, so we include it amongst the control group studies when discussing the impact on smoking prevalence.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Illinois-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Illinois 1999</LINK>) was a randomized trial comparing community sales law enforcement alone to enforcement of youth possession laws as well. Since the intervention is not relevant to this review we report only the pre/post change in sales law compliance for each group of communities and do not classify it as controlled study.</P>
<P>The remaining uncontrolled studies compared rates of illegal sales or smoking behaviour before and after an intervention. In some, only the outlets that allowed purchase at baseline were followed up. In Ontario a series of interventions were implemented in neighbouring health units and the follow up ranged from two weeks to 21 months (<LINK REF="STD-Ontario-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ontario 1992</LINK>). In Oregon, implementation occurred in eight communities at different time points (<LINK REF="STD-Oregon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oregon 1995</LINK>). In one Sydney study, retailers who were prepared to make sales at baseline were randomized to receive warning letters either by post or from an environmental health officer, but there was no non-intervention control (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995b</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the studies were set in the USA, apart from two Canadian studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alberta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Alberta 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ontario-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ontario 1992</LINK>), three British studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bristol-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bristol 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gateshead-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gateshead 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stirling 1997</LINK>), and eight Australian studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-South-Wales-1994" TYPE="STUDY">New South Wales 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Manly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Types of intervention</B>
<BR/>The main interventions were: education about legal requirements; notification of the results of compliance checks; warning of enforcement, and implementation of enforcement by police or health officials. Some studies tested different frequencies of enforcement activity, and different channels of information. In some the intervention included the introduction of new legislation or local ordinances such as a licensing system or a formal requirement for compliance checking. Local ordinances might include components such as bans on self-service displays, and also restrictions on minors' possession and use (<LINK REF="STD-Larimer-County-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Larimer County 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The TPOP campaign in Minnesota aimed "to make tobacco access by youth a salient community issue, to change local ordinances ... to change retailers' and other adults' practices ... and to promote enforcement of tobacco age-of-sale laws". The campaign used a direct action community organising model so communities differed in the specific ordinances introduced. These included an increased licence fee for tobacco outlets, penalties for the vendor and the clerk, a requirement for unannounced compliance checks, and bans on vending machines and self-service displays. Other studies also included elements to raise community awareness and support (<LINK REF="STD-Santa-Clara-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Santa Clara 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solana-County-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Solana County 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-San-Diego-1991" TYPE="STUDY">San Diego 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Woodridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Manly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oregon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oregon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some studies, the intervention had to be modified because of local attitudes. Altman and colleagues were unable to bring about enforcement action because of legal concern about the use of 'sting' operations and an unwillingness to prosecute clerks (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most studies there was dissemination of information to retailers about their legal obligations, including reminders of the age at which purchase was legal, that proof of age should be required before sale, or that warning notices should be displayed. Usually this information was posted, but sometimes mass media channels were used.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome assessment</B>
<BR/>Thirty-one studies assessed retailer compliance with the law using test purchasers. Most studies focused on 'over the counter' sales but some also assessed ease of purchase from vending machines. Some distinguished between sales in shops with behind the counter or locked displays and self service (<LINK REF="REF-Wildey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wildey 1995</LINK>). One study investigated vending machine purchases only (<LINK REF="STD-St-Paul-1990" TYPE="STUDY">St Paul 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twelve studies assessed the effect of an intervention on the smoking behaviour of underage youth. Six of these compared intervention and control areas. Three also assessed retailer behaviour in all areas (<LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>). Two reported smoking prevalence in both areas but retailer behaviour only in the intervention area (<LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gateshead-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gateshead 1996</LINK>), one did not assess retailer behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>). One study provided data on smoking behaviour in a follow-up paper and used data on retailer behaviour to compare communities with high and low compliance, not intervention and control communities (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2003</LINK>). The four other studies were uncontrolled and measured smoking behaviour before and after a change in enforcement practice. Two assessed retailer behaviour as well (<LINK REF="STD-Leominster-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leominster 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Woodridge 1991</LINK>). Eleven of these studies also asked underage smokers about purchase attempts, or where they obtained their cigarettes and how difficult it was to buy them.</P>
<P>
<B>Excluded studies</B>
<BR/>Two surveys have assessed the effect of the tobacco industry sponsored voluntary compliance programme <I>It's the Law</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Its-The-Law-1" TYPE="STUDY">Its The Law 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Its-The-Law-2" TYPE="STUDY">Its The Law 2</LINK>). We did not include them because there was no baseline assessment of retailers before they joined the programme. The authors found no evidence that those participating in the scheme were less likely than other retailers to make illegal sales.</P>
<P>One study investigated ease of purchase of tobacco over the Internet and the use of a filter for blocking site access (<LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2002</LINK>). We have not included it here since the setting and intervention are so distinct from other studies. One study evaluated the use of electronic age verification (EAV) devices to help store personnel use ID information more appropriately (<LINK REF="STD-Krevor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krevor 2003</LINK>). They did not find that EAVs increased the frequency of age verification.</P>
<P>Some econometric studies have included measures of youth access restriction along with other measures of public policy and cigarette price to model youth cigarette demand using cross-sectional survey data. This type of study does fall within our inclusion criteria, but some findings and limitations are covered in the discussion. Reasons for excluding other studies are described in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>

<P>As we considered a heterogeneous range of study designs, we made no attempt at statistical meta-analysis. In uncontrolled studies, background secular change may be incorrectly attributed to an intervention. We therefore gave greater weight in our synthesis to the three controlled studies that measured the behaviour of retailers and minors in the community (<LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although randomization by community is a less biased method for assessing the effect of intervention, statistical analysis of such studies should address the issue of clustering of behaviour within communities. Clustering usually increases the required sample size (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>). Few of the included studies directly addressed this issue: another reason why formal meta-analysis could be misleading.</P>
<P>A further methodological concern is the measurement of outcome. In most studies compliance was judged by a single purchase attempt. However, when multiple purchase attempts were made, the estimates of compliance were lower when retailers were classified as non-compliant only if they never sold. Junck and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Manly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Manly 1995</LINK>) found that compliance after intervention was 74% on the basis of a single purchase attempt at each store, but only 45% if three attempts were made. This bias may overestimate compliance rates in studies using only one purchase attempt. The characteristics of the assessor also affect measurement of compliance. Older youths and females are generally more likely to make successful purchases (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000</LINK>) and rates may also be affected by the ethnicity of the purchasers (<LINK REF="REF-Landrine-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landrine 2000</LINK>). Sales rates may also be underestimated if test purchasers act differently from true underage purchasers (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2001a</LINK>). All the studies which gave details noted that the youths engaged in testing were to state their true age if challenged, and to say that the cigarettes were for their own use.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Does intervention with retailers lead to decreased sales to minors?</B>
<BR/>Eleven controlled trials assessed the effect of an intervention on illegal sales, measured by compliance checks. Six found that intervention reduced the level of illegal sales compared to the control group (<LINK REF="STD-San-Diego-1991" TYPE="STUDY">San Diego 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chicago-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chicago 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harlem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Harlem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Active enforcement was used in three of the successful interventions. In Chicago sales fell marginally in the month after all merchants who had sold cigarettes received a warning, but enforcement produced a much larger fall in sales rates (<LINK REF="STD-Chicago-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chicago 1993</LINK>). Media coverage of the study at one point during the follow-up period caused a further substantial drop in sales in all groups. This study showed that two-monthly enforcement visits were more effective than four- and six-monthly schedules, giving a sales rate of 19% in the final six months of the intervention. In Harlem enforcement produced a substantial decrease in sales, not found after an educational visit alone. However the rate still fell only to 47% (<LINK REF="STD-Harlem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Harlem 1993</LINK>). In Massachusetts compliance rates improved from 35% to 82% in the intervention communities and from 28% to 45% in the control areas (<LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three interventions without enforcement produced greater improvements in compliance than in control areas. Project Trust (<LINK REF="STD-San-Diego-1991" TYPE="STUDY">San Diego 1991</LINK>) used multicomponent community and retailer education with personal visits. Sales fell significantly between pre- and post-intervention measurement in four out of six intervention areas and in none of the control areas. The sales rate was reduced from 70% to 32%, an effect sustained at six month follow up. In Monterey education and community organisation eliminated successful test purchases by the end of a three-year project in two communities compared to a 39% sales rate in the comparison communities (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>). In Sydney warning letters threatening prosecution to retailers who had made illegal sales led to a second offence rate of 31%, compared to 60% amongst those not warned (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other controlled trials did not find a difference. The comprehensive community approach used in Minnesota reduced successful 'over the counter' purchases in intervention communities from 36.7% to 3.1%, but the net change was not significantly different from the control communities where the rate fell from 41% to 8.8% (<LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>). In Santa Clara there was no additional effect of mailed or personally delivered educational materials without enforcement. However, the community and merchant education media had some short-term effect, with sales rates reduced from 74% to 39% (<LINK REF="STD-Santa-Clara-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Santa Clara 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Erie Country there was no effect of education alone (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1987</LINK>) or active enforcement (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1995</LINK>). In the second study the lack of effect could have been because all stores were sent letters warning of possible random checks. The news of 'sting' operations also spread rapidly to the non-enforcement communities. An Australian study (<LINK REF="STD-New-South-Wales-1994" TYPE="STUDY">New South Wales 1994</LINK>) used education and the threat of enforcement. Youths old enough to buy cigarettes, but looking younger, were used for compliance checks so the outcome was requiring proof of age before making a sale. There was an overall improvement from 17% to 43% in the proportion of retailers requiring such proof, but no difference between intervention and control retailers.</P>
<P>All the uncontrolled studies showed reduction in illegal sales following intervention, but the size of the pre/post difference was variable, and not always consistent across communities (<LINK REF="STD-Alberta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Alberta 1991</LINK>). There was some evidence that effects declined over time (<LINK REF="STD-Leominster-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leominster 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oregon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oregon 1995</LINK>). In Oregon, advising retailers whether they had or had not complied with the law at a test purchase had an effect (<LINK REF="STD-Oregon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oregon 1995</LINK>). In Solana County a merchant education programme had such a limited effect that a second phase of police enforcement was initiated. This reduced 'over the counter' sales from 74% to 24% (<LINK REF="STD-Solana-County-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Solana County 1990</LINK>). The highest compliance rates were in Woodridge (over 95%), Central Coast (over 92%), Leominster (84%), Illinois (83% to 96%), Fort Morgan (100%), which all used enforcement, and in Manly (86%), Ontario (94%), Wisconsin (82%) and Larimer County (94%) which did not. The lowest were 49% for baseline noncompliers in Cook County and 48% in Philadelphia which included stores being checked because of reports of violations.</P>
<P>In the study of vending machines, a locking device policy resulted in fewer locations selling cigarettes to minors than a policy of no restriction (<LINK REF="STD-St-Paul-1990" TYPE="STUDY">St Paul 1990</LINK>). However, the authors concluded that it was probably less effective than the major policy alternative, a ban on vending machines.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Do reduced sales of tobacco to minors lead to a reduction in minors' self-reported ease of access?</B>
<BR/>Eleven studies assessed self-reported actual or perceived ease of access. In four (<LINK REF="STD-Woodridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Woodridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>), intervention was associated with decreased test sales. In Monterey self-reported recent purchase of tobacco was less frequent among 7th graders in the intervention than in the control communities. In the other two grades there were large baseline differences in the proportion reporting a purchase in the last three months, so longitudinal changes were difficult to interpret. However, at the final follow up recent purchase was significantly less common amongst intervention community 9th graders (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>). After intervention in Woodridge, 69% of students said that the law would make cigarettes harder to obtain. In 1996 more Woodridge smokers felt it was difficult or moderately difficult to get cigarettes than smokers from another community (20 versus 14.3%, NS) (<LINK REF="STD-Woodridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Woodridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jason-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jason 1999</LINK>). In Massachusetts, despite an effect of intervention on sales there was no difference in perceived ease of access. There were significant falls in the proportion who had tried to buy tobacco in the previous six months, and increases in those who were refused at least half the time. Since these occurred in all communities they could not be attributed to the active enforcement programme. There were also similar changes across intervention and control communities in reported source of cigarettes. Fewer youths bought tobacco in their own city or town and more bought it elsewhere or had someone buy it for them (<LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>). In Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>) the proportion of smokers reporting purchase attempts fell from 83% to 44% over nine years</P>
<P>In Minnesota, the proportion who perceived high availability decreased in the intervention communities whilst increasing in the control communities, despite similar levels of retailer compliance. The proportion of adolescents reporting at least one purchase attempt in the previous month declined in the intervention communities while it increased in the control communities. The authors suggested that these changes might be attributable to the community awareness and mobilisation campaigns that were a part of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Erie County there was little change in reported ease of access to cigarettes, and it was unrelated to either community intervention status or change in measured compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1995</LINK>). In Sydney there was a significant reduction in the proportion of male students who rated purchasing cigarettes from petrol stations as 'easy' or 'very easy' post-intervention, but no other significant changes for the six categories of purchase source (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>). In a later study in the same area (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 2000</LINK>), access remained easy, but there were no data on compliance levels achieved by enforcement and they may have remained low. In Everett more students reported that retailers asked for proof of age. Neither of these studies directly assessed retailer behaviour. In Gateshead few children reported being refused, with no change over time. In Fort Morgan active smokers became less likely to have ever bought cigarettes, but those who had attempted recent purchase were still not consistently asked for proof of age. About half said they were never refused purchase.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Do reduced sales of tobacco to minors decrease prevalence of tobacco use?</B>
<BR/>Four (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>) of seven trials where smoking prevalence was compared against a control area found some evidence of an effect of intervention on youth smoking behaviour. Altman and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>) found a lower smoking prevalence in those who were in 7th grade at baseline, but the effect was not sustained at the end of the 32 month study. There were no significant differences among the other age groups.</P>
<P>In Minnesota (<LINK REF="STD-TPOP-1996" TYPE="STUDY">TPOP 1996</LINK>) there was a lower rate of increase in all measures of smoking prevalence in seven areas with a comprehensive community-based intervention than in seven control communities. The net difference in prevalence was significant for daily but not weekly or monthly smoking. They concluded that refusals by sellers at the time of purchase attempts by young people did not account for the lower adolescent smoking rates seen in the intervention communities, since all communities showed increases in compliance. Other components of the intervention may have changed young people's behaviour. Businesses in the intervention communities were more likely to post warning notices and to store cigarettes behind the counter. Longer term follow up showed a decline in prevalence in both communities that was sharper in the controls so that by 2000 there was no significant difference. This may have been due to the adoption of similar ordinances in control communities (reported in <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Staff and colleagues assessed a community intervention in Sydney with education of retailers and local publicity, measuring smoking behaviour and reported ease of purchase but not illegal sales. There was an effect of intervention only in the youngest students (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 1995a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tutt and colleagues compared monthly prevalence in an area where compliance had reached over 90% to state survey data. Smoking rates fell steadily over a nine year period in the intervention area, whilst staying at first stable and then starting to decline in the state during the period for which data were available (<LINK REF="STD-Central-Coast-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Central Coast 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>One further controlled study where no effect of enforcement was detected on compliance did not report data on prevalence originally. A further report analysed changes in smoking prevalence over a four-year period, comparing six communities where compliance had exceeded 80%, with the six others that had not reached the same threshold (<LINK REF="STD-Erie-County-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Erie County 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2003</LINK>). This found evidence of a decrease in frequent smoking in above-threshold communities compared to an increase in the remainder (P = 0.04). There was also a differential change in 30-day smoking prevalence that did not reach significance. There was no effect of exposure to the intervention programme on smoking levels.</P>
<P>Two studies did not find evidence of change in smoking behaviour. In Massachusetts there was no difference in the rate of change of prevalence of 'any tobacco use' or 'daily tobacco use' between the intervention and control communities. The rate of 'current tobacco use' rose marginally in the intervention communities but remained stable in controls, with borderline statistical significance for the comparison between group trends (<LINK REF="STD-Massachusetts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Massachusetts 1994</LINK>). In Gateshead, an intervention of test purchases in the intervention area resulted in full compliance and hence no prosecutions, although children in the area reported buying cigarettes with ease. There was no change in smoking prevalence (<LINK REF="STD-Gateshead-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gateshead 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the light of these findings, five uncontrolled studies should be interpreted with caution. Three reported a decrease in smoking prevalence in students associated with a reduction in illegal sales in single intervention communities (<LINK REF="STD-Leominster-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leominster 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Woodridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fort-Morgan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fort Morgan 2007</LINK>). In Woodridge the proportion of regular smokers in 7th-8th grade students fell from 16% to 5%. In this study access was very successfully restricted, and possession of tobacco by a minor was also an offence. Longer term assessments in this community using older youths showed higher rates of sales, although still below 20%. A survey in 1996 found a lower proportion of smokers amongst Woodridge students than students from a community not conducting regular enforcement (<LINK REF="REF-Jason-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jason 1999</LINK>). In Leominster there was a fall in smoking prevalence in three out of four age groups. In Fort Morgan prevalence fell significantly in 14-15-year olds. In Everett there was no significant change in overall reported tobacco use after introduction of a local ordinance, but there was a significant decrease amongst girls. In Sydney there was no reduction in adolescent smoking, but a possible increase in never smoking. In this study there was no compliance checking to confirm that access had been reduced (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney 2000</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:07:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review provides evidence about the relative effectiveness of different interventions for reducing tobacco sales by retailers. Simply giving information to retailers about the law is not effective. DiFranza and colleagues showed that merchant participation in voluntary compliance programmes was low (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 1996</LINK>). There is evidence that interventions to educate retailers can improve compliance, but the successful interventions used a variety of strategies, including personal visits and mobilising community support (<LINK REF="STD-Monterey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Monterey 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Enforcement, or warnings of it, generally had an effect on retailer behaviour. Sustaining compliance requires regular enforcement, and the existing evidence suggests reduced effectiveness if checking occurs much less than four to six times a year (<LINK REF="REF-Jason-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jason 1996</LINK>). The penalty for infringement may also be important, although there is little direct evidence of the relative deterrent effect of different penalties. If fines for offenders are low, retailers may become inured to the threat of a prosecution, diminishing the effect of warnings or prosecutions. Removal of a license to sell tobacco could be more effective, if the licensing itself is strictly monitored (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1994</LINK>). Imposing too harsh a penalty may, however, be counter-productive if community attitudes are not supportive. In one study using enforcement, judges were inclined to give suspended sentences because they felt that imposing a heavy fine or criminal record on the clerks making the sale was inappropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Solana-County-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Solana County 1990</LINK>). Enforcement may produce a backlash against tobacco control activities if the value of reducing sales has not been adequately publicised. A graduated system of penalties from a warning to a fine and then loss of licence may be most appropriate where legal systems allow it. The combination of enforcement and fines on youth users was associated with high compliance rates in Woodridge, but punishing the user is a controversial policy which may not gain widespread acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-Mosher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CCS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCS 2001</LINK>). The importance of penalties for violation is supported by a US study comparing best and worst performing states and their correlation with enforcement strategies (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Retailer interventions may not work if neighbouring districts have discordant policies. Retailers who make illegal sales argue that minors will simply go elsewhere, depriving them of revenue without benefiting the community (<LINK REF="REF-Landrine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landrine 1994</LINK>). Uniform enforcement policies may help retailers to comply by reassuring them that their competitors will do the same. Similarly, fitting locks to vending machines is probably less effective than banning them (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main methodological problem in evaluating retailer interventions is that assessment of retailer behaviour during compliance checks does not show whether smoking behaviour by minors has changed, or even how easy it is for them to buy tobacco. Retailers may be able to identify 'test' purchasers, especially if they know or suspect that checks are being made. 'Real' purchasers may be known to the sales clerks, may lie about their age or may behave differently. A study comparing purchase rates between experienced underage smokers and inexperienced nonsmokers showed that smokers were six times more likely to be successful, although absolute rates were still low (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2001c" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2001c</LINK>). In compliance checks, asking for ID proof of age is a strong predictor of refusal to sell (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000</LINK>), however studies show that invalid ID may still allow successful purchase (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Landrine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landrine 2001</LINK>). If retailers are aware of the possibility of compliance checks they may sell only to young people they know. Young people may also change their source, by going to another community or by asking someone else to make the purchase for them (<LINK REF="REF-Rigotti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigotti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>) or stealing them or obtaining in some other way (<LINK REF="STD-MMWR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">MMWR 2002</LINK>). Measuring changes in self-reported ease of access to tobacco is important to demonstrate that an intervention has had an impact on purchasing behaviour. If minors do not perceive that buying tobacco has become more difficult, then it is unlikely that they have changed their use of tobacco. Conversely, a change in smoking behaviour can most confidently be attributed to a change in retailer behaviour if the intermediate outcome of a change in perception of ease of access has also been observed. This is an important message for future research in this area. The results of compliance checks are generally reported as the proportion of retailer selling/not selling tobacco. It has been suggested that a more realistic measure would be the number of retailers who made sales per 1000 youths, thus allowing for the density of retail outlets in different communities (<LINK REF="REF-Jason-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jason 2003</LINK>). Places where there are many retailers may provide easier access (<LINK REF="STD-Hagquist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hagquist 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been increasing interest in investigating the way in which minors obtain cigarettes, in an effort to understand the way in which the commercial and social market for cigarettes operates among youth (<LINK REF="REF-Croghan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croghan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodruff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodruff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>). Direct purchase is only one of the ways in which young people obtain their cigarettes and increasing attention is being given to the sources used and how these differ for older and younger and experimenting and regular smokers. Other sources include borrowing from friends, asking older friends or strangers to buy cigarettes legally, being given them by parents, stealing from parents, and shoplifting (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castrucci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castrucci 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). Interventions other than purchase restrictions may be important in reducing access. Media campaigns could aim to discourage older youths and adults from supplying cigarettes to younger smokers. Price increases could also make smokers less willing to share their cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Chaloupka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaloupka 2003</LINK>). A new way in which minors may be able to bypass purchase restrictions is to buy cigarettes from the internet (<LINK REF="REF-Ribisl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribisl 2003</LINK>). A study has reported that successful purchase is frequent even where proof of age is asked for (<LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2002</LINK>). This study also evaluated whether internet filtering programme could prevent purchase by blocking access to vendors. We did not formally include this study in the review; it found that two internet filters blocked 84% and 94% of identified sites respectively.</P>
<P>Access restrictions might have different effects on subgroups of young smokers, depending both on age, and on whether they are experimenting with smoking, or becoming regular users. It has been suggested that strong access restrictions would have more impact on regular smokers who were less likely to be able to rely on social sources. A large survey in 1996 provided data on usual source for US adolescents who had smoked in the past month (<LINK REF="REF-Castrucci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castrucci 2002</LINK>). Those who were older, or smoked more often or intensely, were more likely to usually use commercial sources. This might suggest that restricting access would have a greater impact on regular smokers. But the counter-suggestion has also been made that experienced smokers are more likely to be able to obtain cigarettes even in the face of reasonable compliance by lying about their age, using fake ID or other strategies. A longitudinal study (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>) found that social sources were the primary source for young teens; continuing smokers increased their number of sources, so that they used both stores and friends more. Another longitudinal study found that communities where youth were more likely to rely exclusively on social access had fewer past month smokers who became weekly of more frequent smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Widome-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widome 2007</LINK>). A cross-sectional analysis of initiation and continued smoking in 6th to 8th grade students found no association between level of retail availability and continued smoking, but there was an association between higher availability and increased odds of having initiated smoking amongst youths not living with tobacco using adults (<LINK REF="REF-Pokorny-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokorny 2003</LINK>). This is not incompatible with the suggestion that restricting commercial access is less likely to have an impact on initial experimentation, since experimenters are likely to get their cigarettes from social rather than commercial sources (<LINK REF="REF-Gilpin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilpin 2004</LINK>). Perception of availability might be as important as actual availability, and experimental smokers might be more affected by perceived difficulty. A longitudinal study in California investigated this. Two cohorts of 12- to 15-year old never-smokers were followed in a period when access law enforcement was weak and then when it was strong. Transition to smoking in the earlier cohort was not affected by the perceived ease of access, but in the later cohort those who perceived access to be difficult were less likely to have tried cigarettes by follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Gilpin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilpin 2004</LINK>). This might be due to changes in social norms around access, and might support the use of access enforcement as part of a comprehensive programme for tobacco control. Another longitudinal study used surveys in Finland over the period when a tobacco sales ban to children 'apparently under age 16' was introduced in 1977 followed by an increase in the age limit to 18 in 1995. This showed a small and short-term decrease in underage tobacco purchase after 1977 and a larger persistent change after 1995. By 2003 only 67% of 14-year old daily smokers had purchased tobacco from commercial sources in the past month, although 48% had purchased from friends (<LINK REF="REF-Rimpel_x00e4_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimpel 2004</LINK>). The study indicated a shift from commercial to social sources after the ban, and only 2 to 3% of daily underage smokers obtained all their tobacco commercially. There was a sharp decrease in daily smoking between 2001 and 2003, some time after the 1995 ban, whilst experimenting was already decreasing before 1995. The authors concluded that the decrease in smoking could not be attributed to the sales ban alone and that other smoking restrictions and health promotion activities had played a role. In Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Hagquist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hagquist 2007</LINK>) the introduction of an underage sales ban coincided with a decrease in adolescent smoking but additional factors also changed. Smoking also fell amongst adults and prices rose. Although compliance testing showed a decrease in ease of purchase from a 93% success rate in 1996, 63% of attempted purchases were still successful in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Sundh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundh 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of problems in drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions with retailers for reducing youth tobacco use. In particular, effectiveness can only be assessed if tobacco sales are reduced. If some retailers continue to sell, a channel of access will exist. Many of the communities studied achieved large decreases in sales, but none achieved complete, sustained compliance. Hence it is not surprising that there is only limited evidence from controlled trials that reducing the ease with which underage youth can purchase cigarettes will reduce their use of tobacco. Some uncontrolled studies, notably Woodridge, have reported impressive reductions in youth smoking behaviour in association with interventions achieving high compliance. This might suggest that there is a threshold level of compliance above which access can be effectively reduced. This hypothesis needs testing prospectively. The findings from Massachusetts suggest that, if there is such a threshold, it must be greater than 80%; density of vendors may be another determinant of availability. The challenge for future research on the effects of restriction of underage sales is to ensure effective implementation of the intervention. Translating access restriction from research to practice is a further challenge. In the USA, despite federal legislation in 1992 (the 'Synar Amendment') requiring all states to enact and enforce a law to prohibit sale of tobacco to minors, progress towards consistent enforcement by all states is slow (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Evidence from other types of study</HEADING>
<P>Studies of predictors of cigarette demand in young people that have included measures of youth access along with price and other measures of tobacco control activity have tended not to show a significant correlation between smoking behaviour and access control as measured by the existence of laws and provision for enforcement (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2001a</LINK> reviews earlier studies). In a larger study Ross and Chaloupka used measured state compliance with youth access restriction, as reported by states under the Synar agreement, in a model of youth cigarette demand using a 1996 survey of over 17,000 US high school students. They found that higher compliance was correlated with lower smoking prevalence and intensity (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2001a</LINK> ). They also found that the impact of higher levels of compliance was greater amongst students who were further advanced in progressing to established smoking, who might be expected to be more dependent on commercial sources of cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2001b</LINK>). The authors note that it is possible that good levels of compliance may reflect local antismoking sentiment, which might affect cigarette demand directly. In Massachussetts a telephone survey of almost 4,000 12- to17-year olds asked about perceived access, attempts to purchase and tobacco use. This was correlated with characteristics of youth access ordinances in their home town. Only two significant associations were found, and only one of them in the expected direction. A ban on free-standing displays was associated with lower perceived access but not with reduced purchase attempts or tobacco use. Requiring a license to sell tobacco was unexpectedly associated with greater perceived access (<LINK REF="STD-Thomson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 2004</LINK>). Baseline nonsmokers from this study were followed up two years later, to look for associations between access ordinances and smoking initiation. No significant associations were found. Predictors of smoking initiation included older age and higher rebelliousness (<LINK REF="STD-Thomson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 2007</LINK>). Since the point estimates were consistent with stronger access regulations reducing uptake, the authors considered whether lack of power was an explanation. However the same data set demonstrated a strong association between a strong smoking policy in a local restaurant and a significantly decreased likelihood of smoking uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 2005</LINK>). The authors suggest that this '... raises the possibility that youth smoking behavior may respond more sensitively to restaurant policy, which is not targeted to youth, than to the policies specifically targeted to youth access'. A study of communities in Oregon compared illegal sales rates and smoking prevalence in grade 8 and grade 11 students. Unexpectedly this found more evidence for a relationship in the older students, where the model predicted that a 10% increase in illegal sales rate gave rise to a 0.8% increase in 30 day prevalence and a 0.4% increase in daily smoking. Eleventh graders in communities with lower illegal sales rates made more use of social sources, but there was an opposite pattern in 8th graders (<LINK REF="STD-Dent-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dent 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Levy and colleagues created a simulation model of the effect of tobacco youth access policies. They concluded that a high level of retail compliance is likely to be necessary, especially in densely populated communities with large numbers of retail outlets. They recognise that there are limits to the effectiveness of purchase restriction policies because of the availability of other sources (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2001</LINK>). Although the potential for enforcement of sales laws to reduce underage smoking may be limited, a recent cost effectiveness analysis suggested that even if it can only reduce youth tobacco use by 5% it is likely to be as cost-effective as other prevention activities (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2001a</LINK>). However alternative strategies such as tax increases do not have an implementation cost. It has been argued that price increases might have direct and indirect effects on youth smoking, by deterring youths from purchase but also by reducing availability from social sources (<LINK REF="REF-Chaloupka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaloupka 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this review are consistent with those of a review and meta-analysis of the group of controlled studies that reported smoking prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Fichtenberg-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fichtenberg 2002a</LINK>). This detected no significant different in youth smoking between communities with access interventions compared to those without. This meta-analysis has been criticised on methodological grounds (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2002</LINK>) but the authors have defended its conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Fichtenberg-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fichtenberg 2002b</LINK>). There remains considerable uncertainty about the part that restricting access should play in a comprehensive tobacco control policy (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2007</LINK>). Whilst some tobacco control researchers consider that using existing approaches to attempt to restrict youth access should not be a major part of tobacco control efforts (<LINK REF="REF-Ling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Glantz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glantz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Etter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etter 2006</LINK>), others argue that they are important in changing social norms, and should remain part of a comprehensive tobacco control program (<LINK REF="REF-Jason-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jason 2002</LINK>). One area of disagreement is whether access controls send important messages about society's disapproval of youth smoking (<LINK REF="REF-DiFranza-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiFranza 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jason-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jason 2003</LINK>), or whether 'they are counterproductive because they reinforce the tobacco industry's "smoking is a way to look adult" message' (<LINK REF="REF-Fichtenberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fichtenberg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further limitation of current research is that it is largely confined to more developed countries. The effectiveness and feasibility of retailer interventions will depend on the attitudes and available resources in different societies. With the acceleration of tobacco use in the developing world there is a particular need for cost-effective interventions to prevent uptake of smoking by the youth of these societies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Legislation alone is not sufficient to prevent tobacco sales to minors. Both enforcement and community policies improve compliance by retailers, but the impact on underage smoking prevalence using these approaches alone may be small if the level of compliance attained does not sufficiently restrict access.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research that only assesses retailer behaviour is of limited value. Any further studies need to link change in retailer behaviour to changes in young people's perceptions of tobacco availability and their smoking behaviour. Studies examining the effects of access restrictions on youth smoking behaviour must first strive to achieve high compliance. There is a need to develop and test strategies for countries in the developing world.</P>

For daily smokers there was a non significant trend towards greater effectiveness among younger students.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Other findings: No differential in increases in requests for ID. Cigarettes became more likely to be stored behind the counter (Signif), and signs posted (NS) in the intervention counties.<BR/>By 2000 by difference in prevalence was no longer significant, and the communities had very similar ordinance scroes.</P>
