<TITLE>Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-07 15:14:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were.</P>
<P>Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials.</P>
<P>We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data.</P>
<P>Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users.</P>
<P>The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-06 18:01:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laurie L Stockton">
<P>The delivery of combination contraceptive steroids from a transdermal contraceptive patch or a contraceptive vaginal ring offers potential advantages over the traditional oral route. The transdermal patch and vaginal ring could require a lower dose due to increased bioavailability and improved user compliance.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-02-06 18:01:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, cycle control, compliance (adherence), and safety of the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring versus combination oral contraceptives (COCs).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-07 15:14:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Through February 2013, we searched MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP for trials of the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring. Earlier searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we contacted known researchers and manufacturers to identify other trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-01-22 19:17:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered randomized controlled trials comparing a transdermal contraceptive patch or a contraceptive vaginal ring with a COC.<BR/>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-15 16:00:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were abstracted by two authors and entered into RevMan. For dichotomous variables, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. For continuous variables, the mean difference was computed. We also assessed the quality of evidence for this review.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-06 18:03:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 18 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Of six patch studies, five examined the marketed patch containing norelgestromin plus ethinyl estradiol (EE); one studied a patch in development that contains levonorgestrel (LNG) plus EE. Of 12 vaginal ring trials, 11 examined the same marketing ring containing etonogestrel plus EE; one studied a ring being developed that contains nesterone plus EE.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Contraceptive effectiveness was not significantly different for the patch or ring versus the comparison COC. Compliance data were limited. Patch users showed better compliance than COC users in three trials. For the norelgestromin plus EE patch, ORs were 2.05 (95% CI 1.83 to 2.29) and 2.76 (95% CI 2.35 to 3.24). In the levonorgestrel plus EE patch report, patch users were less likely to have missed days of therapy (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.51). Of four vaginal ring trials, one found ring users had more noncompliance (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.87 to 8.52), while another showed more compliance with the regimen (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.68).</P>
<P>More patch users discontinued early than COC users. ORs from two meta-analyses were 1.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.00) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.06) and another trial showed OR 2.57 (95% CI 0.99 to 6.64). Patch users also had more discontinuation due to adverse events than COC users. Users of the norelgestromin-containing patch reported more breast discomfort, dysmenorrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In the levonorgestrel-containing patch trial, patch users reported less vomiting, headaches, and fatigue.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Of 11 ring trials with discontinuation data, two showed the ring group discontinued less than the COC group: OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.66) and OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.88). Ring users were less likely to discontinue due to adverse events in one study (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70). Compared to the COC users, ring users had more vaginitis and leukorrhea but less vaginal dryness. Ring users also reported less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional lability than COC users.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For cycle control, only one trial study showed a significant difference. Women in the patch group were less likely to have breakthrough bleeding and spotting. Seven ring studies had bleeding data; four trials showed the ring group generally had better cycle control than the COC group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-20 15:44:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Effectiveness was not significantly different for the methods compared. Pregnancy data were available from half of the patch trials but two-thirds of ring trials. The patch could lead to more discontinuation than the COC. The patch group had better compliance than the COC group. Compliance data came from half of the patch studies and one-third of the ring trials. Patch users had more side effects than the COC group. Ring users generally had fewer adverse events than COC users but more vaginal irritation and discharge.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for this review was considered low for the patch and moderate for the ring. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of information on the randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment, the outcome assessment methods, high losses to follow up, and exclusions after randomization.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-06 18:04:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The transdermal skin patch and the vaginal ring were developed as alternative methods of delivering contraceptive steroids to women. Both methods could increase user compliance by avoiding the need for daily pill-taking of combination oral contraceptives (COCs). Many women using oral contraceptives do not follow the pill regimen consistently. Effectiveness of any contraceptive method depends on compliance with the regimen and continuation (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2009</LINK>). An estimated 47% to 81% of oral contraceptive users in the United States miss at least one pill per cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1998</LINK>). A study in Spain showed that recent users of OCs, the patch, or the ring reported missing or delaying use of their chosen method at high rates: 65%, 30%, 20%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Lete-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lete 2008</LINK>). Even in a randomized trial with electronic monitoring of compliance, 57% of participants missed three or more pills per cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2010</LINK>). This included both the control and the intervention group, which had text-message reminders. In a trial of structured counseling, having at least 12 years of education predicted continuation of an effective contraceptive method at three months (<LINK REF="REF-Langston-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langston 2010</LINK>). Failure rates of the skin patch and the vaginal ring appear similar to those of COCs (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>). The typical-use estimate for pills (9%) was based on the National Survey of Family Growth 1995 and 2002; perfect use for pills (0.3%) was based on clinical trials. For the transdermal patch and vaginal ring, estimates for typical and perfect use were based on those for the pill. Randomized trials had not shown superiority of these methods over OCs (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-06 19:21:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The approved devices in these categories are the Ortho Evra® transdermal patch and the vaginal rings NuvaRing® and Progering® (<LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2013</LINK>). The regimens for these devices mimic that of most COCs: 21 days of active hormones, followed by 7 days without hormones. The marketed transdermal patch is a small, thin adhesive square with daily delivery to the systemic circulation of the progestin norelgestromin (17-deacetyl norgestimate) 150 µg and the estrogen ethinyl estradiol (EE) 20 µg. The patch should be applied for one week to the lower abdomen, upper torso, buttocks, or the upper lower arm (Ortho Evra® only) and then replaced immediately by a new one. Three weekly patches are followed by one patch-free week. Transdermal patches in development include those containing gestodene and EE (<LINK REF="REF-Bayer-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayer 2012a</LINK>), levonorgestrel and EE (<LINK REF="REF-Stanczyk-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanczyk 2011</LINK>), and a levonorgestrel-only product (<LINK REF="REF-NICHD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICHD 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two contraceptive rings have been marketed and others are in development (<LINK REF="REF-Brache-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brache 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2013</LINK>). The NuvaRing® vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device made of polymer tubing that releases an almost constant rate of the progestin etonogestrel and the estrogen ethinyl estradiol (EE). Etonogestrel is the biologically active form of desogestrel (3-keto desogestrel), which is used in some oral contraceptive formulations. Desogestrel belongs to the gonane class of progestins, which are derived from testosterone and include levonorgestrel and gestodene (<LINK REF="REF-Henzl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 2000</LINK>). A cycle of ring use consists of three weeks with the ring in place, followed by a ring-free week. The progesterone-only vaginal ring, Progering®, is approved for use by lactating women in several Latin America countries (<LINK REF="REF-Brache-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brache 2013</LINK>). This three-month ring can be used up to one year, i.e., four rings for three months each. A ring containing nesterone and ethinyl estradiol has been in development (<LINK REF="REF-Pop-Council-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pop Council 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2013</LINK>). The progestin nestorone is derived from progesterone, in particular, 19-norprogesterone. Unlike the etonogestrel ring that is replaced each cycle, the nestorone ring is intended for one-year use. The regimen still involves 21 days of use followed by a 7-day break, but the nesterone ring would be re-used for 13 cycles. Studies in India will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the progesterone-only ring within the various cultures of India (<LINK REF="REF-Pop-Council-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pop Council 2012</LINK>). In addition, a ring containing ulipristal acetate is being developed and is designed for continuous use over three months (<LINK REF="REF-Brache-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brache 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2013</LINK>). This ring could meet the needs for women who cannot use, or prefer to avoid, estrogens (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2013</LINK>). Other prototypes in development include combined rings releasing estradiol instead of ethinyl estradiol for a better safety profile (<LINK REF="REF-Brache-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brache 2013</LINK>). In addition, dual protection rings are being developed to provide both contraception and protection against HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections (<LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2013</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-12 20:14:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The administration of combination contraceptive steroids from a skin patch or vaginal ring offers other advantages over the traditional oral route. Since the gastrointestinal tract and, subsequently, the first-pass effect are avoided, drug bioavailability is higher with these two delivery systems. Increased bioavailability, along with the ability to provide a sustained drug release rate, allows a lower dose to be used. The decreased dosage could improve effectiveness and cycle control while reducing side effects. Also, neither the patch nor the ring has to be fitted by a health care provider. Finally, unlike other vaginal barrier methods, the vaginal ring does not have to be placed to cover the cervix, which simplifies its use.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-02-06 18:04:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Possible drawbacks to these methods include incomplete ovulation inhibition, suboptimal cycle control, and spontaneous detachment of the skin patch or expulsion of the vaginal ring. Also, the ring could potentially lead to vaginal infections, cervical changes, coital interference, unpleasant odor and difficulties or inconvenience related to ring insertion or removal. This systematic review examines the effectiveness, cycle control, compliance (adherence), and adverse events associated with these methods.</P>

<P>The data in the present review were based on the analytic method (e.g., intention to treat, per protocol) used in the trial report. Studies were examined for methodological quality, according to recommended principles (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following factors were assessed: the study design, blinding, randomization method, group allocation concealment, exclusions after randomization, loss to follow up, and early discontinuation.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-11-12 18:00:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. An example is the proportion of women who discontinued early. The Peto OR is useful when treatment effects are small and when events are not very common (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This approach performs well under many circumstances, except when the study arms are severely unbalanced, which rarely occurs in RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>We calculated crude risk for deep venous thrombosis for the ring users in the seven studies that reported serious adverse events (SAEs). We also calculated the risk of venous thromboembolism in the five patch trials; one pulmonary embolism was reported. The denominator was the number of women who used the ring or the patch. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson distribution.</P>
<P>For continuous variables, the mean difference was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed effect model. RevMan uses the inverse variance approach (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). An example is the mean number of bleeding or spotting days. Kaplan-Meier rates for pregnancy were also entered into tables.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-12 18:00:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We tested for statistical heterogeneity using the chi-square test in RevMan. If the P value was &lt; 0.1, we attempted to identify reasons for the heterogeneity, such as methodological differences across the studies.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-02-20 15:44:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not combine data from studies with different doses. Results were not combined in a meta-analysis if the eligible trials differed in their comparison oral contraceptive.</P>
<P>A fixed effect model does not require the assumption of normal distribution for the effects (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). Fixed and random effects will give the same result if no heterogeneity exists, which is also the case if a comparison includes a single study. There is no consensus regarding the use of either model.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for this review and summarized the results. Quality could be high, moderate, low, or very low. RCTs were considered to be high quality then downgraded for each of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>no information on randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment or no concealment used;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Transdermal patch trials</HEADING>
<P>Of the six patch trials, five used the transdermal patch that has been marketed (<LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dittrich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dittrich 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boonyarangkul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Boonyarangkul 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK>). The Ortho Evra® skin patch is produced by Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Titusville, NJ. It consists of a thin, medicated, adhesive layer between a protective polyester layer and a polyester release liner that is removed before application of the patch. The 20 cm<SUP>2</SUP> patch is applied to the upper outer arm, lower abdomen, upper torso or buttocks where it transdermally releases norelgestromin 150 &#956;g and ethinyl estradiol 20 &#956;g daily. Each patch should be attached for one week, after which it should be removed and replaced immediately by a new patch. Three weekly patches are to be followed by one patch-free week. <LINK REF="STD-Dittrich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dittrich 2002</LINK> also included two study groups that were assigned to use smaller patches with decreased drug dosages. The latter patches have not been marketed. The sixth trial used a transdermal patch in development, AG200-15, which releases levonorgestrel 120 µg plus EE 30 µg (<LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>). The regimen for use is the same as that for the norelgestromin plus EE patch.</P>
<P>Most of these trials were multicenter trials, conducted in the USA and Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>); the USA, Europe and South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Dittrich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dittrich 2002</LINK>); Europe and South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>); the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>); and The Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Boonyarangkul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Boonyarangkul 2007</LINK> had one center in Thailand.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal ring trials</HEADING>
<P>Of the 12 ring trials, 11 examined the same marketed vaginal ring. The NuvaRing® (NV Organon, Oss, The NetherlandsMerck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) is a flexible, lightweight ring, made of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, 54 mm in diameter with a cross-section of 4 mm. The device releases etonogestrel 120 &#956;g and ethinyl estradiol 15 &#956;g daily. The ring is inserted into the vagina where it is to remain in place for three weeks. Each ring should be followed by a ring-free week, and a new ring is to be used for each cycle. <LINK REF="STD-Rad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rad 2006</LINK> studied a newer, unmarketed, contraceptive vaginal ring made of silicone rubber. That ring releases nestorone 150 µg and ethinyl estradiol 15 µg daily (<LINK REF="REF-Pop-Council-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pop Council 2012</LINK>). While the ring uses the same regimen as its predecessor (21 days of use and 7 days of nonuse), the nesterone ring is intended for one year of use.</P>

<P>For method of randomization, several trials used a centralized phone system. Most others reported the sequence as 'computer-generated'. Other details such as block size are given in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Adequate methods for allocation concealment include a centralized telephone system (interactive voice response system) and the use of sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002a</LINK>). The use of an automated centralized treatment assignment via telephone greatly reduces the risk of inadvertent or intended assignment errors that can occur with an inadequate process of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Haag-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haag 1998</LINK>). Pharmacy distribution of pill bottles is another good method. Of the included trials, 11 used some concealment as follows: five had interactive phone systems (<LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oddsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oddsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahrendt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahrendt 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK>); one had pharmacy distribution (<LINK REF="STD-Rad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rad 2006</LINK>); three used sequentially-numbered, opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Veres-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veres 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilliam-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gilliam 2010</LINK>); one used envelopes but did not provide much detail (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>); and one had an unspecified method of concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Guida-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Guida 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the remaining seven trials, two did not use concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Duijkers-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Duijkers 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sabatini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sabatini 2006</LINK>) and five did not provide any information about concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Dittrich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dittrich 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boonyarangkul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Boonyarangkul 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elkind_x002d_Hirsch-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Elkind-Hirsch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohamed-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mohamed 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Losses greater than 20% threaten trial validity (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>).

However, four of these studies with high losses had 12 or 13 treatment cycles versus 3 to 6 cycles for most of the other trials. In addition, two trials had differential losses between the study groups with one group losing as much as 30%. In <LINK REF="STD-Duijkers-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Duijkers 2004a</LINK>, the ring group lost 30% while the COC lost 7%. For <LINK REF="STD-Sabatini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sabatini 2006</LINK>, losses ranged from 12% for the ring group to 32% for the gestodene COC group.</P>
<P>Most of the studies used a modified intent-to-treat analysis, in which only the women who received the study treatment for at least one day were included in the analysis.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>The skin patch containing norelgestromin plus EE and the control COC did not differ significantly in contraceptive effectiveness in the three trials reporting pregnancy data. In <LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>, the 6-cycle and 13-cycle Kaplan-Meier cumulative probabilities of pregnancy for the patch versus the COC arm were not significantly different (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). In three trials, the odds ratio (OR) of pregnancy for the patch versus the COC showed the groups were similar (<LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boonyarangkul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Boonyarangkul 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study of the levonorgestrel (LNG) plus EE patch (<LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>) reported the Pearl Indices for in-treatment pregnancies: 4.96 for the patch (6 or 13 cycles) and 4.02 for the COC (6 cycles). Confidence intervals were not provided.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Discontinuation</HEADING>
<P>More patch users discontinued early from the trials reporting those data than women assigned to use the COC. The ORs for overall discontinuation were: for <LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK> combined, 1.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.00; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); for <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK> combined, 1.56 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.06; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>); and for the norelgestromin 150 &#956;g patch in <LINK REF="STD-Dittrich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dittrich 2002</LINK>, 2.57 (95% CI 0.99 to 6.64; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patch users were also more likely to discontinue due adverse events (AEs) than COC users: for <LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK> combined, OR 2.28 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.25; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); for <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 2008</LINK> combined, OR 2.11 (95% CI 1.44 to 3.11; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>); and for <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>, OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.19 to 2.79; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Compliance (regimen adherence)</HEADING>
<P>Patch users showed better compliance to the regimen per cycle than COC users in the three trials providing such data. In <LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>, the OR for compliance was 2.05 (95% CI 1.83 to 2.29; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>, the OR was 2.76 (95% CI 2.35 to 3.24) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). Also, in <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>, women in the levonorgestrel patch group were less likely to have had cycles with missed days of therapy compared to the COC group (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.51; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Dittrich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dittrich 2002</LINK> reported compliance by cycle that ranged from 94% to 97% for the group with the 20-cm<SUP>2</SUP> patch versus 77% to 80% for the OC group. Data were insufficient for analysis here.</P>
<P>The percentages with application site reactions varied. In <LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>, approximately 20% of patch users reported skin reactions and 3% reported early trial discontinuation as a result. Patch detachment was rare, with women reporting about 5% of the patches required replacement due to complete (2%) or partial (3%) detachment (<LINK REF="STD-Audet-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Audet 2001</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Urdl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Urdl 2005</LINK>, about 14% of patch users had application site reactions. For the levonorgestrel patch, <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2012</LINK> reported 3% of diaries indicated patch detachment.

In the five trials of the norelgestromin-containing patch, one venous thromboembolism among 1892 patch users yields an estimated frequency of 53 per 100,000 women (95% CI 1 to 294). If the LNG patch study were included, one venous thromboembolism among 3160 patch users would yield an estimated frequency of 32 per 100,000 women (95% CI 1 to 176).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-25 17:49:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Contraceptive effectiveness was similar for the contraceptive skin patch and comparison oral contraceptive. Effectiveness was also similar for the vaginal ring and the comparison COC. As mentioned earlier, failure rates for the skin patch and the vaginal ring appear similar to those for COCs (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>). Effectiveness of contraceptives depends on compliance with the regimen and continued use (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2009</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Compliance data were limited. Patch users showed better compliance than COC users in the three trials with such data. Compliance results varied across the four vaginal ring studies with those data. One found poorer compliance among the ring users, two showed no difference, and one showed &#8216;perfect&#8217; use was more common for the vaginal ring users compared to COC users. The accuracy and consistency of compliance data depend on the data collection instrument as well as self-reports; the latter can be affected by social desirability. The different reporting across trials as compliance or noncompliance makes makes comparing results difficult. However, differences in reported compliance did not lead to significantly lower pregnancy rates. The sample sizes of the trials could have been insufficient to detect an actual difference in effectiveness.</LI>
<LI>More patch users discontinued early than women assigned to use the COC. Furthermore, women in the patch group were more likely to discontinue due to adverse events. Of 11 vaginal ring trials with discontinuation data, two showed significant differences between the study groups. Vaginal ring users were less likely to discontinue (overall or due to AEs) than COC users.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Satisfaction with the contraceptive method may influence continuation. In one study, patch users were more likely than COC users to be very satisfied with their method. Of the four ring trials that reported satisfaction, three found ring users more likely than the COC group to be satisfied or planning to use the method. Varying results may be due to differences in the comparison COCs, the instruments used to assess satisfaction, and the duration of the trials.</P>
<P>For cycle control, the groups were not significantly different in three of four patch studies with such data. In one trial, breakthrough bleeding or spotting was less common among patch users. The US Food and Drug Administration warns that women using the patch may be exposed to more estrogen on average than women taking a pill with EE 35 &#956;g (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2012</LINK>). The ring trials with bleeding data generally showed fewer problems for the ring group compared to the COC group. In three of seven trials with such data, the ring group had fewer episodes of breakthrough bleeding and spotting. One study showed the ring group had a greater mean for breakthrough bleeding and spotting days. Fewer problems may relate to steady-state hormone levels, in contrast to peaks and troughs with oral contraceptives. The better bleeding patterns did not translate into less discontinuation, though.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For adverse events, five patch trials and seven ring trials reported data. Where significant differences were noted, norelgestromin patch users generally had more AEs than the COC users. These included breast discomfort or pain, dysmenorrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Patch users had less moodiness. Users of a levonorgestrel patch had less nausea, headache, and fatigue. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than COC users in several trials, but less nausea and acne. One trial showed ring users had fewer reports of worsening body weight, headaches, or sex drive. Another found less irritability, depression, and vaginal dryness among the ring users than the COC users. However, that trial investigated certain tolerability issues, presumably actively, whereas other researchers usually summarized participants&#8217; reports of adverse events. Participants may report more problems if prompted, but the effect should be similar in both groups. Since these trials were not blinded, the results could be biased. The estimated risk for deep venous thrombosis in the users of the norelgestromin patch was 53 per 100,000 women (95% CI 1 to 294). For the etonogestrel ring users, the risk was 149 (95% CI 18 to 538) per 100,000 women, but one woman with deep venous thrombosis had an additional risk factor. Because of the rarity of venous thromboembolism, these randomized controlled trials are not informative concerning comparative risk. In surveillance of women in Olmsted County, Minnesota (USA), the overall incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) from 1966 to 1990 ranged from 27 to 84 per 100,000 women per year, for ages 15 to 19 and 40 to 44 years, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>). VTE included both deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk for VTE was higher in pregnancy (96) and even higher in the postpartum period (511) from 1966 to 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>). The increased risk may only affect 5 to 10 per 10,000 users of the patch or certain COCs per year (<LINK REF="REF-Raymond-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raymond 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-20 15:44:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence for this review was considered low for the patch and moderate for the ring, based on the evidence from the studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Of the six patch trials, two provided moderate or high quality evidence. The main reasons for downgrading patch studies were not having information on randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment as well as limitations of the outcome assessment method, i.e., no pregnancy test or no structured questionnaire or definition for contraceptive use or cycle control. Of 12 ring trials, seven had moderate or high quality evidence. The main limitations ring trials were the randomization and allocation issues, followed by losses to follow up greater than 20% and exclusions after randomization.</P>
<P>CONSORT guidelines for the reporting of randomized controlled trials recommend the reporting of outcome data in absolute numbers, rather than percentages (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2009</LINK>). Several trials reported some outcomes only as percentages, which prevented the inclusion of those data in the review.</P>

<P>These trials showed similar effectiveness rates for a contraceptive skin patch or a vaginal ring compared a combined oral contraceptive (COC). The patch could lead to more discontinuation than the COC. Patch users had increased risk for breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than COC users but better cycle control and less nausea, acne, and emotional problems.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-20 15:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Randomized controlled trials of the skin patch and vaginal ring should be reported in a manner consistent with CONSORT guidelines. The quality of the evidence for this review was low for the patch and moderate for the ring. Quality could be improved by providing information on randomization sequence generation and allocation concealment, using more reliable outcome measures, reducing losses to follow up, and including all randomized participants in the analysis. More reporting of pregnancy data from patch studies would strengthen the evidence regarding effectiveness. In addition, assessment and reporting of compliance would aid the interpretation of results.</P>
