<P>Programs offering additional support during pregnancy were not effective in reducing number of babies born too early and babies with low birthweights.</P>
<P>Babies born to mothers in socially disadvantaged situations are more likely to be small and so have health problems. Programs providing emotional support, practical assistance, and advice have been offered in addition to usual care. The Review of 17 randomized controlled trials, involving 12,264 women, found that women who received additional support during pregnancy were less likely to be admitted to the hospital for pregnancy complications and to have a caesarean birth. However, the additional support did not reduce the likelihood of giving birth too early or that the baby was smaller than expected. </P>

<P>Studies consistently show a relationship between social disadvantage and low birthweight. Many countries have programs offering special assistance to women thought to be at risk for giving birth to a low birthweight infant.

<P>We included 17 trials (12,264 women). Programs offering additional social support for at-risk pregnant women were not associated with improvements in any perinatal outcomes, but there was a reduction in the likelihood of antenatal hospital admission (three trials; n = 737; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92) and caesarean birth (nine trials; n = 4522; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97).</P>

<P>Pregnant women need the support of caring family members, friends, and health professionals. While programs which offer additional support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or preterm baby, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of antenatal hospital admission and caesarean birth.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-22 15:03:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low birthweight, usually defined as weight less than 2500 grams, is a major health problem for a baby and the baby's family, and one which consumes significant healthcare resources. In high-income countries preterm birth is the major reason for low birthweight<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Blanc-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 2005</LINK>). In low- to middle-income countries, chronic maternal malnutrition leads to large numbers of babies who are small for gestational age (SGA) at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Blanc-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yasmin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasmin 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus 'low birthweight' is an outcome that includes both infants that are born early (less than 37 weeks) and/or who are SGA. Combining babies who are born preterm with those who are SGA is problematic from a research perspective, since the underlying causes of the two problems are believed to be quite different, and treatment is different (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yasmin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasmin 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effective prevention of low birthweight may depend in part on its cause. Nevertheless, many countries have programs offering special assistance to women thought to be at risk of giving birth to an infant weighing less than 2500 grams. These programs may include advice and counseling (about nutrition, rest, stress management, use of alcohol/ recreational drugs), tangible assistance (e.g. transportation to clinic appointments, help with household responsibilities), and emotional support. The programs may be delivered by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals, by specially trained lay workers, or by a combination of lay and professional workers. This Review includes all acceptably controlled trials of such programs.</P>
<P>Studies consistently show a strong relationship between social disadvantage and low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2003</LINK>). The underlying causal pathways are unclear, but several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed that link the physiological and psychological stress associated with social disadvantage to an increased likelihood of complications during pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, intrapartum complications, operative delivery, preterm birth, and poor maternal and neonatal health. Chronic poverty can lead to malnutrition, unhealthy living environments, increased risk of infection, and increased stress in daily life. The social stigma associated with being marginalized in society is also a source of chronic stress. Social support may have a mediating influence on the relationship between life stress (regardless of the causes of the stress) and the development of pregnancy complications. (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current Review focuses on evaluations of programs for pregnant women believed to be at high risk for giving birth to a preterm or SGA baby, that have the provision of support as a major component. Readers are referred to Cochrane Reviews that have evaluated other forms of care to prevent preterm birth, SGA birth, and/or low birthweight. These Reviews have evaluated bedrest, nutritional supplements, nutritional advice, interventions to assist pregnant women to stop smoking, plasma volume expansion, oxygen therapy, and various medications (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reveiz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reveiz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-1996c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 1996c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Debates have arisen regarding the relative benefits of 'professional' versus 'peer' support. Social support from a woman in one's community, who has a similar socioeconomic background and is experiencing similar life stresses, may be qualitatively different from support from a healthcare professional, who has broad professional knowledge and experience, but may not share the same socioeconomic background or life concerns, and who often provides other professional services as well as support. This Review includes studies of support by providers with varying backgrounds and qualifications.</P>

<BR/>'Additional support' was defined as some form of emotional support (e.g. counseling, reassurance, sympathetic listening) with or without additional information or advice, or both, occurring during home visits, clinic appointments, and/or by telephone. The additional support could also include tangible assistance (e.g. transportation to clinic appointments, assistance with the care of other children at home).

<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Since women and care providers cannot be blinded to type of antenatal care given, blinding was considered adequate if outcomes were recorded by outcome assessors who had no knowledge of the woman's group assignment. We judged studies at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results.

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. To be included in the review, data on a given outcome had to be available for at least 80% of those who were originally randomized. Where sufficient information is reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, we planned to include missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as:</P>

<P>Seventeen trials, involving 12,264 women, met the inclusion criteria; <I>see</I> table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. While all participants were judged to be at risk for giving birth preterm or to a low birthweight baby, the inclusion criteria defining risk status was variable. Most trials used a combination of social and obstetrical factors. The trials were conducted in Australia, Great Britain, France, Latin America, South Africa, and the United States. No single outcome was reported in all 17 trials. For example, data were available from 11 trials (n = 8681participants) for birthweight lower than 2500 gm, from another set of 11 trials (n = 10,429 participants) for gestational age less than 37 weeks, but from only single trials (n = 1887 and n = 458) for satisfaction with antenatal care and postnatal depression, respectively.</P>

<P>Eight trials had women complete questionnaires during the postpartum period (<LINK REF="STD-Blondel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blondel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooten-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klerman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klerman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oakley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oakley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 1992</LINK>).

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brooten-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brooten 2001</LINK>) also reported healthcare utilization information for the first year postpartum, but the data could not be used because of uncertainty about the follow-up rate for this information. This uncertainty stemmed from the following: 1) the one-year follow-up information was included in a table with delivery information and no separate denominators were reported; 2) the process for maintaining contact with the participants was not outlined; 3) some loss to follow up would be expected when tracking women for such a long period of time and none was noted; and 4) including the full sample for the one-year follow-up data meant that two participants with spontaneous miscarriages were included.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-04-19 10:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Social support interventions for at-risk pregnant women have not been associated with reductions in the numbers of preterm babies (11 trials; n = 10,429; risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.01, low birthweight babies (11 trials; n = 8681; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03), or perinatal mortality (11 trials, n = 7522; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.26). Social support interventions for at-risk pregnant women were associated with a decreased likelihood of caesarean birth (nine trials; n = 4522; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97) and antenatal hospital admission (three trials; n = 737; RR 0.79. 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92). Results of five trials indicate women who received additional social support were almost three times more likely to have their pregnancies terminated (n = 5587; RR 2.87, 95% CI 1.42 to 5.78). This outcome was not pre-specified.</P>
<P>When sensitivity analyses were conducted comparing the results with and without the Spencer trial (<LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1989</LINK>) where 58.6% of those randomized to additional support did not accept it, the results did not change materially when the trial was excluded. For the termination of pregnancy comparison, the results were in the same direction but the 95% confidence interval did include 1.0 when the Spencer trial was removed (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 4.43).</P>
<P>Because there was only one trial in which the support was provided by lay women (<LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1989</LINK>), and in another trial the support was provided by a multidisciplinary team that included lay women (<LINK REF="STD-McLaughlin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McLaughlin 1992</LINK>), we did not perform the planned subgroup analysis. However, the results of these two trials were remarkably consistent with those of the other trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-19 10:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general the social support intervention was comprehensive and intensive, although timing of onset varied from the first to third trimester, with the majority of women enrolled at about mid-pregnancy. Despite the comprehensiveness of the intervention, the diversity of outcomes, and despite the solid theoretical rationale for linking stress, social support, and pregnancy outcome, there was no significant reduction in the likelihood of low birthweight, preterm birth, or perinatal death . Depression (during and after pregnancy) and maternal satisfaction with antenatal care were also apparently unaffected. While the theoretical rationale for links between social support, stress, and health is strong, it may be that social support (regardless of the quality and quantity) is not sufficiently powerful to improve the outcomes of the pregnancy during which it is provided. An argument could be made that, given the immense social deprivation experienced by most of the women in these trials, it would be surprising if social support could have such an immediate and powerful effect.</P>
<P>An alternate, or complementary, explanation for the lack of effect of social support on preterm birth or low birthweight is that our abilities to identify women who are at high risk of preterm birth or low birthweight babies are seriously limited, and thus many women were included in these trials who were not actually at higher risk of these outcomes. Furthermore, the underlying causal mechanisms linking social disadvantage to adverse pregnancy outcomes have not been identified.</P>
<P>Two outcomes were significantly associated with enhanced social support during pregnancy: decreased likelihood of caesarean birth, and decreased likelihood of antenatal hospital admission. These meta-analyses involved multiple trials and over 4000 and 700 women respectively. On the assumption that the results did not occur by chance, we offer the following interpretations.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">(1) Caesarean birth</HEADING>
<P>It is noteworthy that the effect size is very similar to that in the Cochrane Review of support during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2007</LINK>), and it is consistent with an observational study that linked social support to reduced likelihood of intrapartum complications and operative birth (<LINK REF="REF-Norbeck-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norbeck 1983</LINK>). Both of the latter reports describe mechanisms whereby additional support, by lessening anxiety and fear, reduce the likelihood of obstetric complications and thereby increase the likelihood of normal vaginal birth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">(2) Antenatal hospital admission</HEADING>
<P>It is possible that the enhanced support allowed for early detection of pregnancy complications either by the caregiver or the woman herself. Treatment could then be handled on an out-patient basis rather than requiring hospitalization.</P>
<P>We did find a significant association between enhanced social support during pregnancy and an increased likelihood of termination of pregnancy. But it must be noted that this was not a pre-specified outcome and the confidence interval did alter during the sensitivity analysis. However, we feel the following interpretation might be helpful. The additional support may have resulted in women's increased awareness of the added social risk to themselves or their families, and/or their increased awareness of an increased medical risk to the baby, and thus more women were likely to take action to avoid additional problems. Also, an important aspect of social support is the provision of information. Thus, it is possible that women in the additional support group sought or received additional information, or both, about the option of pregnancy termination.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-02-11 13:09:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pregnant women need and deserve to have the help and support of caring family members, friends, and health professionals. However, such support is unlikely to be powerful enough to overcome the effects of a lifetime of poverty and disadvantage, or a longstanding pregnancy complication, and thereby influence the remaining course of a pregnancy. Pregnant women and their caregivers should be informed that programs which offer additional support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or preterm baby, but they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of caesarean birth or antenatal hospital admission.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-19 10:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There appears to be no need for further trials evaluating the medical effects of social support during pregnancy on immediate pregnancy and maternal or neonatal outcomes, or both. The possibility of improved psychosocial outcomes requires confirmation by larger trials that ensure adequate follow up of participants. Qualitative studies conducted concurrently with such trials would provide valuable information about women's evaluations of the additional support. There is an urgent priority for studies which identify the cause(s) of preterm birth. Future studies of forms of care to prevent low birthweight should differentiate between the two distinct causes of low birthweight: being born preterm and being SGA.</P>

<P>The unit of randomization was the clinic and the unit of analysis was the woman, thus interfering with the estimates of effect by creating the potential for confidence intervals to be misleadingly narrow. No intraclass correlation co-efficient is reported.</P>
<P>5 clinics were randomized to the experimental group and 3 to the control group. Women in the experimental clinics who met eligibility criteria and consented to participate were offered additional prenatal visits, education on prevention of preterm birth, screening for psychosocial and nutritional problems, and crisis intervention. Women in the experimental clinics were further randomized to 1 of 5 intervention groups: bedrest, psychosocial support, Provera, placebo, or nothing further. Women in the control clinics received usual care, which did not include education on preterm birth.</P>
<P>Analyses are based on a subset of women, who met eligibility criteria and were not subsequently excluded or lost to follow up. Women in the experimental group differed significantly from those in the control group; the experimental group had a lower proportion of Hispanic women and women who had not completed high school, and were at higher pregnancy risk. Among the reasons for exclusion of enrolled participants from data analyses were stillbirth and multiple gestation. Despite the methodological problems which would tend to bias results in favour of the experimental group, the study results were comparable to those of the included studies in this Review: no significant differences in preterm birth rate, rates of low birthweight, and mean gestational age.</P>
