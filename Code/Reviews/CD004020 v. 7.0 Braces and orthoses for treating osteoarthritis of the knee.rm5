<P>
<B>Research question</B>
</P>
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of braces and foot/ankle orthoses in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. We searched for evidence up to March 2014. We found 13 studies (n = 1356) and included in this update six additional studies (n = 529 participants).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included studies reporting results in patients with early to severe knee OA (Kellgren &amp; Lawrence grade I-IV) treated with a knee brace (valgus knee brace, neutral brace, neoprene sleeve) or an orthosis (laterally or medially wedged insole, neutral insole, variable or constant stiffness shoe) or given no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: What is osteoarthritis and what are braces and orthoses?</B>
</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that protects the ends of bones breaks down, causing pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis can occur in different areas of the knee or can affect the whole knee. Depending on the area, osteoarthritis can change the alignment of joints.</P>
<P>Braces and orthoses are devices that you wear to support your knee joint. Orthoses are insoles that fit comfortably inside your shoes. Braces are made of combinations of metal, foam, plastic, elastic material and straps. A knee brace can be fitted specially for the person wearing it.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review shows the following in people with osteoarthritis of the knee.</P>
<P>
<B>Wearing a knee brace compared with no brace:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8226; may result in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving knee function and quality of life after 12 months (low-quality evidence); and<BR/>&#8226; causes many patients to stop their initial treatment because of lack of effect in both groups.</P>
<P>Stiffness and treatment failure (need for surgery) were not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Wearing a laterally wedged insole compared with no insole:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8226; may result in little or no difference in reducing pain (low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Function, stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and side effects were not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Wearing a laterally wedged insole compared with wearing a neutral insole:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8226; probably results in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving function, stiffness and quality of life after 12 months (moderate-quality evidence).<BR/>
<BR/>Treatment failure and side effects were not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Wearing a laterally wedged insole compared with a valgus knee brace:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8226; may result in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving function after sx months (low-quality evidence).<BR/>
<BR/>Stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and side effects were not reported</P>
<P>We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Side effects may include pain in the back of the knee, low back pain, foot sole pain or skin irritation.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>&#8226; Low-quality evidence suggests that people with OA who use a knee brace may have little or no reduction in pain, improved knee function and improved quality of life.<BR/>
</P>
<P>&#8226; Moderate-quality evidence suggests that people with OA of the knee who wear laterally wedged insoles or neutral insoles probably have little or no improvement in pain, function and stiffness.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-03 18:46:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee can be treated with a knee brace or a foot/ankle orthosis. The main purpose of these aids is to reduce pain, improve physical function and, possibly, slow disease progression. This is the second update of the original review published in Issue 1, 2005, and first updated in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-03-03 18:47:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of braces and foot/ankle orthoses in the treatment of patients with OA of the knee.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-03 18:49:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE (current contents, HealthSTAR) up to March 2014. We screened reference lists of identified trials and clinical trial registers for ongoing studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-03 18:49:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and controlled clinical trials investigating all types of braces and foot/ankle orthoses for OA of the knee compared with an active control or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-05 09:39:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias using the 'Risk of bias' tool of The Cochrane Collaboration. We analysed the quality of the results by performing an overall grading of evidence by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. As a result of heterogeneity of studies, pooling of outcome data was possible for only three insole studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-05 09:47:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 studies (n = 1356): four studies in the first version, three studies in the first update and six additional studies (n = 529 participants) in the second update. We included studies that reported results when study participants with early to severe knee OA (Kellgren &amp; Lawrence grade I-IV) were treated with a knee brace (valgus knee brace, neutral brace or neoprene sleeve) or an orthosis (laterally or medially wedged insole, neutral insole, variable or constant stiffness shoe) or were given no treatment. The main comparisons included (1) brace versus no treatment; (2) foot/ankle orthosis versus no treatment or other treatment; and (3) brace versus foot/ankle orthosis. Seven studies had low risk, two studies had high risk and four studies had unclear risk of selection bias. Five studies had low risk, three studies had high risk and five studies had unclear risk of detection bias. Ten studies had high risk and three studies had low risk of performance bias. Nine studies had low risk and four studies had high risk of reporting bias.</P>
<P>Four studies compared brace versus no treatment, but only one provided useful data for meta-analysis at 12-month follow-up. One study (n = 117, low-quality evidence) showed lack of evidence of an effect on visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores (absolute percent change 0%, mean difference (MD) 0.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 0.84), function scores (absolute percent change 1%, MD 1.0, 95% CI -2.98 to 4.98) and health-related quality of life scores (absolute percent change 4%, MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.04) after 12 months. Many participants stopped their initial treatment because of lack of effect (24 of 60 participants in the brace group and 14 of 57 participants in the no treatment group; absolute percent change 15%, risk ratio (RR) 1.63, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.82). The other studies reported some improvement in pain, function and health-related quality of life (P value &#8804; 0.001). Stiffness and treatment failure (need for surgery) were not reported in the included studies.</P>
<P>For the comparison of laterally wedged insole versus no insole, one study (n = 40, low-quality evidence) showed a lower VAS pain score in the laterally wedged insole group (absolute percent change 16%, MD -1.60, 95% CI -2.31 to -0.89) after nine months. Function, stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and adverse events were not reported in the included study.</P>
<P>For the comparison of laterally wedged versus neutral insole after pooling of three studies (n = 358, moderate-quality evidence), little evidence was found of an effect on numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores (absolute percent change 1.0%, MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.65), Western Ontario-McMaster Osteoarthritis Scale (WOMAC) stiffness scores (absolute percent change 0.1%, MD 0.07, 95% CI -4.96 to 5.1) and WOMAC function scores (absolute percent change 0.9%, MD 0.94, 95% CI - 2.98 to 4.87) after 12 months. Evidence of an effect on health-related quality of life scores (absolute percent change 1.0%, MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03) was lacking in one study (n = 179, moderate-quality evidence). Treatment failure and adverse events were not studied for this comparison in the included studies.</P>
<P>Data for the comparison of laterally wedged insole versus valgus knee brace could not be pooled. After six months' follow-up, no statistically significant difference was noted in VAS pain scores (absolute percent change -2.0%, MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.75) and WOMAC function scores (absolute percent change 0.1%, MD 0.1, 95% CI -7.26 to 0.75) in one study (n = 91, low-quality evidence); however both groups showed improvement. Stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and adverse events were not reported in the included studies for this comparison.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-05 11:19:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence was inconclusive for the benefits of bracing for pain, stiffness, function and quality of life in the treatment of patients with medial compartment knee OA. On the basis of one laterally wedged insole versus no treatment study, we conclude that evidence of an effect on pain in patients with varus knee OA is lacking. Moderate-quality evidence shows lack of an effect on improvement in pain, stiffness and function between patients treated with a laterally wedged insole and those treated with a neutral insole. Low-quality evidence shows lack of an effect on improvement in pain, stiffness and function between patients treated with a valgus knee brace and those treated with a laterally wedged insole. The optimal choice for an orthosis remains unclear, and long-term implications are lacking.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-05 11:19:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common medical condition that is often seen in general practice and causes considerable pain and immobility. In the United States, approximately 9% of individuals aged 60 years and older suffer from knee OA (<LINK REF="REF-Losina-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Losina 2013</LINK>). The prevalence of symptomatic knee OA has increased substantially over the past 20 years. Aging, obesity and increased awareness of knee pain have accounted for this trend (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2011</LINK>). Risks for a poor functional outcome in individuals with knee OA involve collateral and cruciate ligament laxity, age, body mass index (BMI) and degree of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2003</LINK>). In addition to consequences for the patient, OA presents a considerable burden for society because of its chronic course, high costs of interventions and related productivity costs (<LINK REF="REF-Healy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hermans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermans 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis of the entire knee is distinguished from OA of one compartment (<LINK REF="REF-Grelsamer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grelsamer 1995</LINK>), which generally is caused by a mechanical problem (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-GM-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer GM 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tetsworth-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetsworth 1994</LINK>). Individuals with OA of the medial compartment often have a varus alignment, and the mechanical axis and load bearing pass through the medial compartment. Those with OA of the lateral compartment generally have a valgus alignment, and the mechanical axis and load bearing pass through the lateral compartment. Malalignment increases risk and progression of knee OA and predicts decline in physical function (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-GM-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer GM 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanamas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanamas 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initial treatment for patients with OA of the knee is conservative, consisting of restricted activity, decreased body mass index (BMI), patient education and physical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Foley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fransen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fransen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goorman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goorman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>). Pharmacological treatments tend to only modify symptoms (e.g. analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs); however some are intended to be curative (hyaluronic acids, chondroitin sulphate) (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leopold-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leopold 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nuesch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuesch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Towheed-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towheed 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uebelhart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uebelhart 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittle 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Electro-acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), braces, foot/ankle orthoses and leech therapy are not standard treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Rutjes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutjes 2009</LINK>) but can be effective in symptom reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Deshaies-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deshaies 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michalsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michalsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2003</LINK>). If symptoms persist, surgical therapy such as high tibial osteotomy or knee arthroplasty can be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-RW-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer RW 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stukenborg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stukenborg 2001</LINK>) .</P>

<P>A knee brace or a foot/ankle orthosis is defined as "any medical device added to a person's body to support, align, position, immobilize, prevent or correct deformity, assist weak muscles, or improve function" (<LINK REF="REF-Deshaies-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deshaies 2002</LINK>). The general purpose of braces and orthoses is to decrease pain, improve physical function and possibly slow disease progression. Proprioception/stability is a hypothesised but unproven underlying explanatory factor. Lateral wedge insoles and special valgus braces are designed to reduce load in the medial compartment (<LINK REF="REF-Hewett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsuragawa-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Katsuragawa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Komistek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Komistek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindenfeld-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindenfeld 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maillefert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Maillefert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several types of orthoses are available to treat patients with medial knee OA non-operatively. This review includes studies comparing the laterally wedged insole, the valgus knee brace, the neutral knee brace, the neoprene sleeve and variable shoe stiffness versus each other or versus no treatment. The valgus knee brace and the laterally wedged insole are used most commonly in the non-operative treatment of varus medial knee OA.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-03 21:07:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The goal of the interventions is to improve function, reduce symptoms and possibly slow disease progression. The valgus knee brace and the laterally wedged insole are used with the goal of unloading the diseased medial compartment by creating a valgus effect on the knee. Neutral braces and neoprene sleeves are thought to immobilise and stabilise the knee. Neutral insoles, shoes of variable stiffness and lateral wedged insoles could have a cushioning effect (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-05 09:56:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The literature suggests that patients with varus medial knee OA may benefit from braces and foot/ankle orthoses. However many different types of braces and foot/ankle orthoses are available. It remains unclear which brace or foot/ankle orthosis will provide the greatest benefit or harm to patients treated for varus medial knee OA (<LINK REF="REF-Parkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkes 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We created a 'Summary of findings' table for the major outcomes of pain, function, stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure, serious adverse events and total adverse events.</P>
<P>We analysed the quality of the presenting results by performing an overall grading of evidence by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>). We assigned the highest quality rating to randomised trial evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach specifies the following levels of quality.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trial evidence can be downgraded to moderate, low or very low quality depending on the presence of the following factors.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Limitations in design and implementation of available studies suggesting high likelihood of bias.</LI>
<LI>Indirectness of evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes).</LI>
<LI>Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses).</LI>
<LI>Imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals).</LI>
<LI>High probability of publication bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Quality will fall by one level for each factor, up to a maximum of three levels for all factors. If very severe problems are noted for any one factor (e.g. when assessing limitations in design and implementation, all studies were unconcealed and unblinded and lost more than 50% of participants to follow-up), the quality of randomised trial evidence may fall by two levels on the basis of that factor alone.</P>
<P>If pooling of study results is not possible, then a single study is included and by definition low-quality evidence, which can be downgraded according to risk of bias items.</P>

A total of 60 participants were included in the intervention group (brace and standard conservative treatment) and 57 in the control group (standard conservative treatment alone). The brace is available for right and left knees in four sizes. The brace consists of a thigh shell and a calf shell (both of carbon fibre) connected by titanium hinges on the medial and lateral sides. The adjustable side bar on the medial side of the brace provides valgus (1-12.5 degrees) with medial unloading, or varus (1-10 degrees) with lateral unloading. The randomisation procedure consisted of a computer-generated block method using sealed envelopes. Participants included 59 men and 58 women. Mean age was 59 years. Mean BMI was 29. The degree of OA was scored according to Ahlback. Patients with an Ahlback score of I or II were included. Mean varus alignment was nine degrees.

Standing radiographs of participants with and without their respective insoles were taken before entry into the eight-week study. Degree of varus was 181 degrees FTA. Six-month results were published in 2004. A total of 61 participants completed the six-month follow-up: subtalar strapped insole (n = 29) versus traditional laterally wedged insole (n = 32). Two-year results were published in 2006. Only 42 participants completed the two-year follow-up: subtalar strapped insole (n = 21) versus traditional laterally wedged insole (n = 21). Analysis was performed without an intention-to-treat approach. All results were presented in the original articles as pre/post analysis, not as between-group differences (<LINK REF="STD-Toda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2001</LINK>). However, for both the original review and the updated review, the study author was contacted for more information; he sent the missing information on between-group analysis of FTA, VAS and Lequesne index scores.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Toda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2002</LINK> published a second trial comparing a subtalar strapped insole (n = 42) with a sock-type ankle supporter (n = 46). Individuals with symptomatic medial knee OA were included in this trial (K&amp;L II-IV). The wedge of the strapped insole was made from urethane with elevation of 6.35 mm strapped to an ankle sprain supporter. The sock-type ankle support extended from malleoli to metatarsals and consisted of a lateral wedged heel insole with elevation of 6.35 mm. The trial took place in the same year (2000) as the first study. The quasi-randomisation procedure was performed according to birth date. All participants were female. Mean age was 65 and mean BMI was 25. Degree of varus was 181 degrees (FTA). Follow-up was eight weeks, and no participant was lost to follow-up. Results were presented as pre/post analysis, not as between-group differences. Second, the Lequesne index was presented graphically and no exact numbers were given. However, the study author was contacted for more information again, and he provided the missing information on between-group analysis of the Lequesne index.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Toda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2008</LINK> published a third RCT of 227 participants with symptomatic medial knee OA (K&amp;L I-IV). In this study a placebo - a neutral wedged insole into shoes (n = 45) - was compared with four interventions - a wedged insole with shoes (n = 45), a sock-type ankle supporter with a wedged insole without shoes (n = 46), a subtalar strapped insole with shoes (n = 45) and a subtalar strapped insole without shoes (n = 46). The randomisation procedure consisted of a computer-generated block method using sealed envelopes. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were presented only for the 207 participants who completed the 12-week follow-up. A total of 20 of 227 participants did not complete the study, which included 24 men and 183 women. Mean age was 65 years. Mean BMI was 25. Degree of OA was scored according to K&amp;L. Degree of varus was 181 degrees (FTA). Most results were presented as pre/post analysis, and only intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was compared between placebo and different interventions.</P>
<P>Outcome measures included function scores, VAS scores (pain), analgesic/NSAID intake, walking distance, WOMAC scores (pain, function and stiffness), Hospital for Special Surgery knee scores (HSS; function), McMaster Toronto Arthritis score (MACTAR; function), Lequesne index (pain and function), degree of OA (Ahlback and K&amp;L), global patient assessment, quality of life (EQ-5D; a measure of health status), leg alignment (HKA angle; FTA), compliance and side effects.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-05 11:04:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted this review to assess the benefits and harms of braces and orthoses for treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. We included a total of 13 studies (n = 1356). These studies have reported results for patients with early to severe knee OA (Kellgren &amp; Lawrence (K&amp;L) I-IV) treated with a valgus knee brace, a laterally wedged insole, a neutral insole or a variable or constant stiffness shoe, or given no treatment.</P>
<P>We found inconclusive evidence for the benefits of a valgus knee brace: Only four controlled trials were published. <LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK> concluded that in patients with varus knee OA, a brace provides additional beneficial effects in terms of pain and function compared with medical treatment alone. However, baseline characteristics were different between study groups, and the quality of the study was low. <LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK> concluded that a brace offers little or no additional effect compared with conservative treatment alone in patients with unicompartmental OA. However, many patients do not adhere in the long run to this kind of treatment because the positive effects are too small or because the side effects are too large. <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_Rath-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Rath 2011</LINK> reported improved Tegner, Insal, Lequesne, Western Ontario-McMaster Osteoarthritis Scale (WOMAC) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in the knee brace group after 16 weeks of treatment. They reported no improvement in the control group (no treatment) and described no side effects of treatment; however this study was sponsored, and study authors were not able to provide their data because of a server breakdown. <LINK REF="STD-Sattari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sattari 2011</LINK> reported a statistically significantly decreased pain score in the knee brace group compared with the no treatment group after nine months. Walking distance was increased statistically significantly in the brace group in contrast to the no treatment group after nine months. Investigators described no side effects of the brace. All four studies showed some clinical effect; however the methodological quality of these studies was low.</P>
<P>Moderate-quality evidence shows the benefits of a laterally wedged insole (vs no treatment or a neutral insole) for medial compartment OA: We included seven controlled trials in this review with conflicting evidence. <LINK REF="STD-Barrios-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barrios 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Maillefert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Maillefert 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sattari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sattari 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Toda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2008</LINK> reported statistically significantly improved patient-reported outcomes after a laterally wedged insole was worn; however <LINK REF="STD-Bennell-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bennell 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Toda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2001</LINK> reported reductions smaller than the minimal clinically important difference.</P>
<P>Conflicting evidence was found for preference of a neutral or a laterally wedged insole. Results reported by <LINK REF="STD-Barrios-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barrios 2009</LINK> favoured the laterally wedged insole, <LINK REF="STD-Maillefert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Maillefert 2001</LINK> favoured the neutral insole and <LINK REF="STD-Bennell-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bennell 2011</LINK> reported no statistically significant differences between the two insoles. Pooling of results of three studies comparing laterally wedged and neutral insoles resulted in lack of evidence of an effect on WOMAC pain scores, WOMAC stiffness scores and WOMAC function scores at one month and at 12 months (see also <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data for the comparison of laterally wedged insole versus valgus knee brace could not be pooled. After six months' follow-up, VAS pain scores and WOMAC function scores were improved and did not differ statistically significantly in the two groups (see also <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-05 11:08:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials investigated a knee brace and eight studies examined foot/ankle orthoses for medial compartment OA of the knee. It is important to note that the findings of these studies may lack generalisability: In the studies of Toda and Rodriques (<LINK REF="STD-Toda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriques-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriques 2008</LINK>), all participants were female, and in <LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sattari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sattari 2011</LINK>, most participants were male. In all studies the age of participants was relatively high (mean 63 years). In the <LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK> trial, baseline characteristics differed between participants. It is important to present full data: <LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK> presented change scores without baseline scores and without a standard deviation. <LINK REF="STD-Toda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Toda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Toda 2002</LINK> presented pre-analysis and post-analysis results but did not report between-group differences. <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller_x002d_Rath-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Müller-Rath 2011</LINK> presented their scores only graphically and could not provide their data because of a server breakdown.</P>
<P>Particularly, researchers studied the effects of braces and orthoses for medial compartment OA. Compared with lateral compartment OA of the knee, medial compartment OA has a much higher prevalence because lateral compartment OA is associated with trauma and is less clinically frequent. This is probably why only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>) examined the effect of a brace or an orthosis for lateral compartment or general OA of the knee. Furthermore, varus bracing for lateral OA is probably less effective; the adduction moment at the knee during the stance phase of walking causes mainly medial loading (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1980</LINK>). In general OA of the knee, there is no compartment to unload, and perhaps a sleeve or a neutral brace will benefit. No studies compared a brace or an orthosis with operative treatment such as high tibial osteotomy or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-05 11:11:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conclude that in cases of varus medial compartment knee OA, low-quality inconclusive evidence shows benefits of bracing for pain, stiffness, function and quality of life in the treatment of medial compartment knee OA. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that a laterally wedged insole is as effective as a neutral insole. Evidence is lacking to suggest that a laterally wedged insole is more effective than no treatment. Also evidence of low quality suggests no statistically significant difference in clinical effect between the laterally wedged insole and the valgus knee brace.</P>
<P>The optimal choice for an orthosis remains unclear, and long-term implications are lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-05 11:12:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of studies investigating the benefits of braces and orthoses has to be improved, particularly the randomisation procedure and blinding measures. Moreover to improve the generalisability of results, studies should not be limited to female participants.</P>
<P>Short-term benefit must be established first to justify the considerable resources required by and the ethical implications involved in a lengthy study. Subsequently, a follow-up period of at least five years is needed because OA is a chronic disease. One general knee score would allow pooling of results. We recommend using the WOMAC because this has been shown to be a valid instrument for measurement of OA (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 1997</LINK>). Between-groups analysis is necessary to show relevant differences. Future studies should provide complete data on outcome measures, including means and standard deviations or 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>It is important to score side effects because they influence the patient's compliance with the intervention. This especially concerns braces, which can be obtrusive in many cases. For insoles, bigger and less stylish shoes are needed. New trials should investigate the long-term benefits of braces and orthoses compared with standard conservative care. More studies are needed to identify predictive factors for the success of brace and insole treatment. If feasible, braces should be compared with ankle/foot orthoses. If braces and orthoses are effective, they should be compared with operative treatment such as high tibial osteotomy or knee arthroplasty for medial compartment OA. It will be interesting to learn for how long surgery can be delayed by this kind of conservative treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gossec-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossec 2007</LINK>).</P>
