<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Nasal polyps are common, benign swellings of the lining of the nose. In some people they may cause no symptoms, but in others they may lead to nasal obstruction, congestion, facial pressure and anosmia (loss of sense of smell). The incidence of symptomatic nasal polyps increases with age and they are more common in men than in women. The cause of nasal polyps is not fully understood but they may be a result of chronic (long-term) inflammation of the lining of the nose (termed 'chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps'). Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps can be treated medically, for example with drugs such as topical (intranasal) steroid sprays, or with surgery (for example, nasal polypectomy with or without endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS)). However, it is unclear what is the most effective management strategy.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Four randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 231 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, are included in this review. The number of patients in each study ranged from 34 to 109. The studies took place in ENT departments in several European countries. All patients were adults and most of the studies enrolled more men than women. In all studies the patients were randomly assigned to either surgery or medical treatment (such as antibiotics or steroid tablets or injections) in addition to topical steroids given as nasal sprays or drops. Both the type of surgery performed and the medical treatments used varied widely between the studies, and did not allow all of the studies to be looked at together. Rather, we considered the treatment groups in the four studies as three separate pairs of comparisons instead of simply 'surgical' versus 'medical' treatments.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The main outcome measures were patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores and health-related quality of life scores, as well as generic health-related quality of life scores. There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) did not find a difference in general health-related quality of life scores.</P>
<P>Two studies reported changes in polyp size (when looked at with an endoscope) using a score. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a significantly better score in the surgery group than in the steroids group at 12 months. In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups.</P>
<P>There were no reported differences between the different medical and surgical treatment groups in any study for any other objective (clinician-based) measurements. Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but nosebleeds (epistaxis) were the most commonly described complication with both medical and surgical treatment; severe complications were reported rarely in either group.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. One positive finding (polyps size scores) from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. There is not enough evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the most appropriate treatment for this condition. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has significant implications for quality of life and the use of healthcare services. Further research to investigate this problem is justified.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, we found this evidence to be of low or very low quality. We have low confidence in the estimates of these studies; further research will very likely change these estimates. There were serious limitations in how the studies were carried out or reported (or both), and the number of participants involved was small. In addition, some of the treatment regimens used in the trials are no longer current standards of therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.</P>
<P>This evidence is up to date to 20 February 2014.</P>

<P>Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review. No studies were at low risk of bias. The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics. There were three comparison pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, n = 109), (2) polypectomy versus systemic steroids (two studies, n = 87); (3) ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid (one study, n = 35). All participants also received topical steroids but doses and types were the same between the treatment arms of each study, except for the study using antibiotics. In that study, the medical treatment arm had higher doses than the surgical arm. In two of the studies, the authors failed to report the outcomes of interest. Although there were important differences in the types of treatments and comparisons used in these studies, the results were similar.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-24 15:12:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal polyps are tumour-like hyperplastic swellings of the nasal mucosa, most commonly originating from within the ostiomeatal complex (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 2004</LINK>). They are a common problem; the prevalence is estimated at 0.2% to 4% in worldwide studies (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lange-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Min-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Min 1996</LINK>). There is at least a 2:1 male to female predominance. The incidence of symptomatic nasal polyps increases with age, reaching a peak in individuals aged 50 to 59 years, and then declines (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 2004</LINK>). While polyps can be asymptomatic, they may produce symptoms such as nasal obstruction, congestion, anosmia and facial pressure, and are associated with a significant reduction in quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Radenne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radenne 1999</LINK>). Nasal polyps are usually found in association with chronic rhinosinusitis, which is broadly divided into two phenotypes based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps on examination. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a chronic disease, with a clinical course often lasting over 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Vento-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vento 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Nasal polyps are considered a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps defines these conditions clinically as: "inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, associated with two or more of the following symptoms:</P>
<UL>
<LI>blockage/congestion; discharge (anterior or post-nasal drip); facial pain/pressure; reduction of smell; and</LI>
<LI>either endoscopic evidence of polyps; mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus or oedema/mucosal obstruction primarily in the middle meatus; and/or mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex or sinuses on computed tomography (CT) imaging" (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkens 2012</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is then further defined by the endoscopic visualisation of polyps bilaterally in the middle meatus. The condition is defined as chronic when symptoms persist for more than 12 weeks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Histology</HEADING>
<P>Histologically, polyps consist of extracellular oedema with an associated inflammatory cell infiltrate, with a surface covering of respiratory epithelium, often with areas of metaplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1989</LINK>). The inflammatory cells found are characterised by type 2 T-helper cell (Th2) inflammation, predominantly eosinophils (<LINK REF="REF-Stoop-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoop 1993</LINK>), in addition to mast cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and plasma cells (<LINK REF="REF-Pawliczak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawliczak 2005</LINK>). Numerous inflammatory mediators, growth factors and adhesion molecules are increased, including interleukins (IL), particularly IL-5, interferon Y, RANTES, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, eosinophilic cationic protein and p-selectin (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Nasal polyps are thought to be a manifestation of chronic inflammation, where they represent the final common pathway of several disease processes, the trigger for which is still unknown. There are numerous theories including hereditary factors, anatomical factors, systemic and local allergy, and infection.</P>
<P>A positive family history of nasal polyps has been found in 14% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Greisner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greisner 1996</LINK>), and nasal polyps have developed even when identical twins have been exposed to different environmental factors, suggesting a genetic link. Certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA), such as HLA-DR7, have been associated with an increased susceptibility to developing nasal polyps (<LINK REF="REF-Molnar_x002d_Gabor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molnar-Gabor 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anatomically, mucosal contact within the nose has been postulated to cause an inflammatory reaction, with subsequent cytokine release leading to polyp formation (<LINK REF="REF-Stammberger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stammberger 1991</LINK>). However, mucosal contact also occurs without polyp formation (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1997</LINK>). Ostiomeatal occlusion secondary to an anatomical abnormality or mucosal oedema has also been suggested as an initiator of inflammation.</P>
<P>The eosinophilia, mast cell degranulation and high immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels found in nasal polyps suggest that allergy is a factor in polyp formation. However, when 3000 atopic patients were assessed only 0.5% had nasal polyps on anterior rhinoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Caplin-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplin 1971</LINK>). Similarly, objective measures of atopy (such as skin prick testing) were no more common in nasal polyp patients than in controls (<LINK REF="REF-Jamal-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamal 1987</LINK>). A local allergic response within the nose may be responsible for nasal polyps, since it has been shown that total and specific IgE in polyp tissue correlates with the degree of eosinophilia, but is unrelated to positive skin prick tests (<LINK REF="REF-Bachert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachert 2001</LINK>). The allergens responsible may be bacterial, as bacterial-specific IgE has been identified in patients with nasal polyps but not in those with allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Calenoff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calenoff 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infection may trigger immunologic events leading to the development of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> has been found to colonise the nose in two-thirds of patients with nasal polyps, compared with less than a third of controls and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (<LINK REF="REF-van-Zele-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Zele 2004</LINK>). IgE antibodies specific to <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> enterotoxins SE-A and B have been found in nasal polyp tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Bachert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachert 2001</LINK>), indicating that superantigens could be involved in the pathogenesis. Superantigens are toxins of microbial or viral origin that target the immune system, triggering polyclonal T-cell proliferation and activation. They have the ability to bypass conventional restrictions of the immune system triggering massive cytokine release. Therefore they could induce IgE synthesis leading to eosinophilic inflammation. Colonisation, however, does not always lead to production of superantigens, and other factors must be involved (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>True type 1 allergic (eosinophilic) fungal sinusitis is characterised by diffuse nasal polyposis. The increasingly widespread demonstration of fungi in the nasal cavity and sinuses in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis has led to the suggestion that fungal colonisation may play an aetiological role in all polyps (<LINK REF="REF-Ponikau-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponikau 1999</LINK>), recruiting eosinophils and leading to release of inflammatory mediators. However, fungi may also be found in up to 100% of healthy control subjects (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are clear associations between chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and other diseases. The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in asthmatic patients is reported to be as high as 13%. Conversely, in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, the prevalence of asthma is as high as 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Rugina-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rugina 2002</LINK>). There is an even stronger association in patients with aspirin hypersensitivity and bronchial asthma; more than 90% of these patients have severe nasal polyposis. This association is referred to as Samter's triad (<LINK REF="REF-Samter-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samter 1968</LINK>). Nasal polyps are also associated with cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia syndromes (Kartagener's syndrome, Young's syndrome) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg Strauss syndrome).</P>
<P>In summary, nasal polyps are likely to represent the end result of many different mechanisms and the search for a single aetiological factor may be in vain. Regardless of trigger, the end result is a failure to mount an appropriate immune response to antigens in the nose and sinuses, resulting in chronic inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-24 15:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps involves both surgical and medical approaches and remains a controversial subject. A variety of intranasal corticosteroids form the mainstay of conservative management, with good evidence for their efficacy. A number of randomised, placebo-controlled trials document statistically significant improvements in subjective symptom scores, polyp size and objective nasal flow rates following topical steroid use (<LINK REF="REF-Kalish-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalish 2012</LINK>). Symptoms of nasal obstruction can be controlled in anywhere from 50% up to 80% of patients. However, clinical studies indicate that management of anosmia is poor, especially when compared with systemic steroids. Adverse effects from nasal steroids are few, and range from epistaxis to headaches and dizziness. Using the more modern formulations, such as fluticasone or mometasone, there is minimal systemic absorption and the dose is well below that required for adrenal suppression.</P>
<P>The use of systemic steroids (often termed a 'medical polypectomy') has also shown to be effective. Van Camp treated 25 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps with oral steroids; 72% had relief of symptoms and 52% improved on computed tomography (CT) scan. Unlike topical therapy, systemic steroids appear to be effective in improving sense of smell (<LINK REF="REF-van-Camp-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Camp 1994</LINK>). A recent systematic review identified three randomised controlled trials demonstrating benefit over placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Devesa-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Devesa 2011</LINK>). However, there is a high rate of recurrence of symptoms once oral steroids are stopped (<LINK REF="REF-Lildholdt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lildholdt 1989</LINK>). The use of oral steroids is limited by their toxicity, with adverse effects including weight gain, immunosuppression and adrenal suppression. Using a combination of topical and intermittent oral steroids, reasonable symptom control can be achieved in the majority of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Slavin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavin 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alternative preparations used in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are reported in the literature, but lack the evidence base of corticosteroids. It has been suggested that treatment with leukotriene inhibitors has resulted in improvement and resolution of the polyps, particularly in patients with aspirin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Parnes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnes 2002</LINK>). Macrolide antibiotics have been proposed to have therapeutic activity based on their anti-inflammatory properties. Long-term, low-dose macrolide antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce IL-8 production in nasal polyps and decrease their size (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 2000</LINK>). However, subgroup analysis of a placebo-controlled trial suggests benefit is limited to patients with normal levels of IgE (<LINK REF="REF-Cervin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cervin 2014</LINK>). New approaches, particularly targeting eosinophilic recruitment, are evolving. Interleukins, particularly IL-5 and eotaxin (but also IL-13 and IL-8) may play a major role in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (<LINK REF="REF-Bachert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachert 2000</LINK>). IL-5 is essential for maturation of eosinophils in the bone marrow and orchestrates their migration into the tissues. Blockage of IL-5 and eotaxin production, chemokine receptors and other sites in the inflammatory pathway using neutralising monoclonal antibodies is currently being investigated in patients with asthma, rhinitis and nasal polyps. While these approaches may offer alternatives to corticosteroid treatment or surgery, large-scale controlled trials are lacking at present.</P>
<P>In cases of marked mechanical obstruction of the airways or chronic disease unresponsive to maximal medical therapy, surgical intervention is the treatment of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Slavin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavin 1997</LINK>). Occlusion of the nasal passages by large polyps may be treated by simple polypectomy to restore patency of the nasal airway. The spectrum of surgical options ranges from simple polypectomy using a snare or forceps to surgery opening into the sinuses, or radical 'nasalisation' of the sinuses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Staging and outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>As curative treatment is hard to achieve in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, management is primarily aimed at reducing symptom severity. It is therefore important to include a measurement of health-related quality of life when assessing the severity of disease or outcome of treatment. The duration and severity of individual symptoms may be measured numerically, or using visual analogue scales (VAS). In addition, there are now many validated questionnaires available that measure general health or disease-specific quality of life. Several instruments have been designed and validated to measure disease-specific quality of life in sinonasal disease; some examples are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Alternatively, severity may be measured using clinical indicators of disease. Polyps are graded by convention as: grade I - confined to the middle meatus; grade II - extending below the level of the middle turbinate; and grade III - causing total obstruction. Endoscopic examination may assess the condition of the nasal mucosa and demonstrate residual or recurrent disease following treatment. The Lund-Mackay staging system generates a simple numeric score from the CT scan (and hence is available only when such imaging is performed) and may be used to stage the extent of inflammatory disease within the sinuses on cross-sectional imaging (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1997</LINK>). The total score ranges from 0 to 24. The Lund-Mackay score in 'normal' individuals in the absence of symptoms or signs of chronic rhinosinusitis has been found to be 4. The score does not reflect the extent of polyps in the nasal cavity, but some studies have found an association between the score and the likelihood of recurrence following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nasal obstruction may be estimated using acoustic rhinometry (which measures the cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity) or rhinomanometry (which measures nasal resistance) (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2005</LINK>), although the correlation between such measurements and subjective symptoms of blockage is poor in some studies (<LINK REF="REF-Thulesius-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thulesius 2012</LINK>). Expired nasal nitric oxide (nNO) levels may be used to give a measure of sinus ventilation or obstruction. Revision surgery rates or topical steroid usage may be used as evidence of treatment failure.</P>
<P>A discrepancy between 'subjective' symptomatic improvement reported by patients following surgical treatment for polyposis and 'objective' endoscopic evidence of resolution of disease in response to surgery has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1992</LINK>). The ideal study should therefore include both patient-based and clinical measures of outcome.</P>

<P>In summary, both the aetiology and the most effective management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps remains unknown. Studies have shown that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis report poorer generic quality of life scores than patients with other chronic conditions including angina, congestive heart failure and chronic back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Glicklich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glicklich 1995</LINK>). In the US, chronic rhinosinusitis has been shown to account for 12 million doctor visits and 70 million restricted activity days annually (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>). This is a chronic and common problem with a significant health burden, reducing both quality of life and normal activity, and hence merits review to identify the optimum treatment.</P>
<P>The comparison of different types of surgical intervention (simple polyp surgery versus more extensive surgical clearance) for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is assessed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>We excluded any 'split-nose' studies in which the patient acts as their own control, i.e. one side of the nose is treated surgically and the other side is treated medically (similar to 'split-mouth' studies).

<P>As the mean time between revision procedures has been shown to be six years in a large, multicentre cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 2006</LINK>), included studies should ideally have a follow-up period of many years.

<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and we applied this in the interpretation of results. There are four possible ratings: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high quality of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low quality implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs which do not have serious limitations as high quality. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of the these factors:</P>

<P>Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK> were diagnosed by biopsy (unclear but presumably this must have included direct visualisation). The median age was 48 years (range 22 to 64 years), but the demographics of the surgical and medical subgroups were not reported separately. Fifteen participants (46.9%) were female and 17 (53.1%) were male, but again surgical versus medical subgroups were not reported separately. Exclusion criteria were recent steroid treatment (sustained-release within three months, systemic within two months or topical within one month), pregnancy or acute purulent sinusitis. However only participants who were assessed as having "failed" medical therapy after one month (in phase one patients were randomised to either placebo, 400 g of budesonide or 800 g of budesonide daily) qualified to be randomised to a separate "surgical versus medical treatment" part of the study. It was unclear how many of these patients had received budesonide or placebo therapy in phase one.</P>
<P>The diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis in <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> was primarily based on criteria described by the Staging and Therapy Group (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1995</LINK>); nasal polyps were diagnosed by endoscopy. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, lactation, significant psychological problems, inability to comply with study protocol, children under 18 years, systemic diseases affecting the nose (e.g. Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoid, primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, and acute upper or lower respiratory tract infections within two weeks of the inclusion visit), use of systemic corticosteroids within four weeks of the inclusion visit, systemic diseases preventing participation in the study, and surgical or medical treatments influencing the study. One hundred and thirty-one participants met the initial inclusion criteria and consented to take part. All received six weeks of medical treatment consisting of Dexa-Rhinaspray (DRS - 40 g dexamethasone and 240 g tramazoline hydrochloride) twice daily into each nostril and an alkaline nasal douche. Out of 131, only 90 were subsequently randomised into the study: seven were lost to follow-up, eight had only minimal disease on CT scanning, and 26 responded to medical treatment prior to the study. The overall mean age was 43  13 years and there were 45 males and 45 females, but the 35 participants with nasal polyps were not described separately.</P>

<P>The surgical and medical treatments used were not comparable between most studies, although two studies were similar (<LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK>). All patients in these studies also had concurrent topical steroids, with both arms receiving same doses, except for <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>. There are therefore three comparisons (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for further details):</P>
<OL>
<LI>Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids, plus topical steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Polypectomy versus systemic steroids, plus topical steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid (<LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>, the surgical group underwent ESS consisting of polypectomy and anterior ethmoidectomy in all 56 patients; 49 participants also underwent posterior ethmoidectomy and 45 had more extensive surgery. Two weeks after surgery, the participants commenced topical budesonide 400 g twice daily for one year. The medical group were treated with oral prednisolone for 14 days (30 mg for four days, then the dose was reduced by 5 mg every two days), after which these participants also commenced topical budesonide 400 g twice daily for one year.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK>, surgical treatment involved removal of visible polyps under local anaesthesia. The medical group were treated with a single dose of 10 mg betamethasone dipropionate and 4 mg betamethasone disodium phosphate (Diprospan) intramuscularly. Both groups then commenced topical beclomethasone dipropionate nasal spray 100 g twice daily for one year.</P>
<P>Phase one of <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK> was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with all 126 participants randomised (method not specified) to either placebo or a 400 g or 800 g dose of budesonide daily for one month. After one month, the results of treatment were assessed as described above to determine whether treatment had been a "success" or a "failure". Those deemed to have "failed" were randomised (method not specified) to an additional treatment of either surgery involving a snare polypectomy under local anaesthetic or a single injection of 10 mg betamethasone dipropionate and 4 mg betamethasone disodium phosphate (Diprospan) intramuscularly. Phase two was started after completion of phase one; all participants were randomised to either 400 g or 800 g of budesonide for a further 11 months. Phase three followed on from phase two and did not involve any further treatment unless deemed necessary by the physician.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>, participants in the surgical group underwent ESS under general anaesthesia after the Messerklinger technique by two senior surgeons, the extent of which was tailored to the disease. After surgery, all participants were prescribed a two-week course of erythromycin (500 mg twice daily), Dexa-Rhinaspray (DRS - 40 g dexamethasone and 240 g tramazoline hydrochloride twice daily into each nostril) and an alkaline nasal douche, followed by a three-month course of fluticasone propionate intranasal spray (100 g twice daily into each nostril) and an alkaline nasal douche. After that, medical treatment was tailored to the symptoms, which comprised a topical corticosteroid spray in most instances. Participants in the medical group received a 12-week course of erythromycin (500 mg twice daily for two weeks, then 250 mg twice daily for 10 weeks), an alkaline nasal douche and intranasal corticosteroid; participants with nasal polyps received a 12-week course of fluticasone propionate drops (400 g twice daily into each nostril). In addition, three participants with polyps were prescribed a nine-day course of oral prednisolone tablets (30 mg for three days, 20 mg for three days and 10 mg for three days) after failure of the above regimen to control their manifestations. After that, medical treatment was tailored to the symptoms. Therefore, in this study, there was a nine-month period in both arms where patients' treatment was based on symptoms, rather than a standardised protocol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All participants in <LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK> had an initial baseline assessment, then further assessments at six and 12 months post-treatment. The outcomes consisted of nasal symptom scores (0 to 3), endoscopic polyp size scores (0 to 3) and a quality of life assessment using the short form 36 (SF-36) health questionnaire (both physical and mental components). Lund-Mackay CT scores (0 to 24) were reported before treatment began.</P>
<P>All patients in <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK> had an initial assessment with "recording of symptoms and signs" (methods not specified) and baseline measurements of smell (method not specified) and nasal expiratory peak flow, then further assessments regularly for one year (at two weeks, and two, four, six, nine and 12 months). Results for olfactory tests were reported at two to 12 months.</P>
<P>All participants in <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK> were assessed at three, six, nine and 12 months and then every three months for a further year. At every visit participants were assessed with symptom scores (0 to 3), endoscopic polyp size score (0 to 3), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) index (nasal PEFR/oral PEFR) and a semi-quantitative smell test (0 to 3); an overall subjective assessment of treatment efficacy was made at the end of phase two.</P>
<P>All participants in <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> had an initial assessment then further assessments at six and 12 months, and outcomes for participants with nasal polyps were reported separately. Each assessment included patient-reported symptom scores using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 10) and disease-specific quality of life using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20, 0 to 100), generic health-related quality of life SF-36 (eight domains, 0 to 100 each), endoscopic scoring, nasal nitric oxide (NO) levels (a gas produced within the sinuses, levels of which may be used as an indicator of sinus disease), acoustic rhinometry and the saccharine clearance time (a measure of ciliary function within the nose, in which the time taken to taste a saccharine tablet placed just inside the nose is recorded).</P>
<P>For the main outcomes of interest for our review, data from validated scores were only available for SF-36 and SNOT-20. Other than <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK> (where the method was not stated), all had used patient-reported symptom scores but these scores were not reported as validated; it is unclear whether these can reliably detect changes in the outcomes of interest and are sensitive enough to differentiate the difference between two groups.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>, surgical complications were recorded. <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK> mentioned complications in both groups, but not all were quantified. <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK> recorded adverse events in both groups.

<P>It is not possible to blind participants to medical versus surgical intervention. Whilst assessors may be blinded when reviewing the results of investigations or subjective scores, evidence of surgery may be apparent on endoscopic examination. No study reported blinding either the participants or assessors and, taking into account that most of the outcomes of interest are subjective measures, we therefore considered them all at high risk. In addition, the treatment protocol for <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> only lasted 12 weeks post-randomisation. Between the end of this treatment protocol and the time point measured (12 months), the "medical treatment was tailored to patients' manifestations". For one arm to be treated more intensively than the other is a very serious risk of bias, since blinding is not possible.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK> reported a drop-out rate of 16% (data available for 95 out of 109 patients), but did not specify the drop-out rates for each treatment arm. It also did not specify how the missing data were handled in the analysis, giving a high risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> had an overall drop-out rate of 13% from the whole study; the drop-out rate for the subgroup with nasal polyps is not clearly stated but appears to include 0% of the surgical group and 18.8% of the medical group. Of these studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> gave a reason for attrition (which was "lost to follow-up"), but it remained at high risk of bias despite this due to the differential drop-out for the nasal polyps subgroup. <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK> did not report whether or not there was any attrition so the risk of bias was unclear. It is also unclear how many of the patients randomised to the surgery versus systemic steroids group in <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK> were available; the study does not report the outcomes from this part of study separately. The only information available is combined with that of phase two; only 75 out of 124 patients (60%) who entered this phase of the study were available at 12 months.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-19 09:47:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the treatments were not standardised across studies and there were three different pairs of comparisons (endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids, polypectomy versus systemic steroids, and ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid), the studies consistently reported that no important difference was found between groups for patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or disease-specific health-related quality of life scores, such as Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) (<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>), or generic health-related quality of life scores (SF-36) (<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>), suggesting that medical and surgical treatment are of equivalent efficacy (low to very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Only two studies employed patient-reported quality of life measures (<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>). Significant improvement in quality of life was reported across both comparisons (ESS versus systemic steroids, and ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid), but there was no important difference found between groups. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for further details.</P>
<P>The same two studies reported improvements in endoscopic appearances in both comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>). In the former (ESS versus systemic steroids), the ESS group were significantly better at 12 months. There were no significant differences found between any other comparisons for any other objective measurements.</P>
<P>The surgical and medical treatments used in the included studies are all effective for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; most studies do not report a significant difference between the treatment groups. However, there is some limited evidence to suggest that surgery may convey an additional benefit over medical treatment, as far as patient-reported symptom scores and endoscopic appearances are concerned. No studies reported any medical treatment producing better outcomes than any surgical treatment at 12 months.</P>
<P>The potential complications of both surgical and medical treatment also need to be taken into account; these have not generally been well documented. Complication rates of up to 14.3% for all surgical treatment and 21% for all medical treatment are described, but these data are incomplete and cannot be used to make a judgement regarding the possibility of harm. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for further details.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-19 09:23:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence reviewed is relevant to the study question and incorporates all available evidence from the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) currently available.</P>
<P>Whilst the different treatment regimes used may reflect clinical practice, they do not follow recent European evidence-based guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkens 2012</LINK>), and the evidence is therefore indirect. The variety of treatments used also makes it difficult to pool results together and draw any specific conclusions or make firm recommendations about best practice. It must also be recognised that all studies gave postoperative medical treatment, usually in the form of topical intranasal steroids, in line with standard clinical practice, so any surgical treatment given cannot be considered in isolation; rather it should be considered as an adjunct to long-term medical treatment.</P>
<P>We cannot be confident about the completeness of the data, as there were serious reporting biases in two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK>); outcomes were either not reported or reported in a way that provided insufficient data for meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1997</LINK> admits that "in general, the present analysis considers the entire study as a clinical entity".</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-28 12:25:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies, including 231 participants, have been included in this review. They all have different methodology, use different surgical techniques and varying medical treatment regimes, and employ a variety of non-standardised subjective and objective outcome measurements. They all include relatively small numbers of patients with relatively short-term follow-up (12 months) for what is a chronic condition.</P>
<P>Whilst all the surgical and medical treatments used led to improvements in patient-related symptom scores and some objective measures, overall the quality of the evidence to support the use of surgical or medical treatment is low or very low (using the GRADE criteria), as can be seen from <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The quality of the evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the effectiveness of endonasal/endoscopic surgery or medical treatment in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The quality of the evidence for patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores is low due to limitations in the design of studies and indirectness of evidence. The quality of evidence regarding patient-reported quality of life scores is low, with indirectness of the evidence and publication bias affecting this. There is very low quality evidence for endoscopic appearances based on limitations in the design of studies, indirectness of the evidence and publication bias. The quality of evidence for complications is very low because of limitations in the design of studies, indirectness of the evidence and publication bias. There is low quality evidence for objective physiological measures due to limitations in the design of studies and indirectness of the evidence. The quality of evidence for olfactory tests is very low, with limitations in the design of studies, indirectness of the evidence and imprecise results.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-10-24 16:27:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy should have identified all relevant studies as broad search terms were used, all languages were included and trial databases were included to ensure any unpublished studies were found. We contacted authors where necessary to obtain unpublished data. Three authors independently reviewed the search results to minimise selection bias. Two authors extracted data independently and were in agreement throughout, limiting bias. However, the authors were not blinded to the authors of the studies, which is a potential source of bias. The lack of data reported in a way that is suitable for (meta-)analysis is a form of reporting bias; we have tried to contact the authors of the studies to obtain further information but have not been successful.</P>
<P>There were no marginal decisions during the review process. We did make some minor changes to the protocol: we further developed the methods section regarding study selection and clarified our outcome measures (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were unable to combine the studies for meta-analysis, as the interventions and outcomes used in each were not directly comparable. The type and dose of both systemic and topical steroids differed in three of the four studies; one study included a prolonged course of antibiotics as part of its medical treatment. The type and extent of surgery was also different in three of the four studies, hence the need to describe the outcomes with reference to three different pairs of treatment comparisons. In two studies, it was also not possible to extract numerical results; outcomes were given only as P values and exact figures were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Alobid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Alobid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lildholdt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lildholdt 1988</LINK>). Despite attempting to contact the study authors we were unable to obtain any exact data to use in a meta-analysis. These same studies either do not describe what statistical method was used or use non-parametric tests, which precluded us from obtaining the standard deviation for analysis. The selective reporting biases in these individual studies meant that this review was unable to carry out meta-analysis. In addition, the lack of comparability means that meta-analysis would have been difficult to justify for most outcomes even with all the data available.</P>

<P>The 2012 European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps is the only recent evidence-based systematic review on the aetiology, management and treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps, and it agrees that the efficacy of ESS is equivalent to that of medical therapy in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkens 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-28 12:16:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence relating to the effectiveness of different types of surgery versus medical treatment for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is of low or very low quality (further research is very likely to have an impact on our effect estimates and we are uncertain of the estimates). The evidence did not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements, recurrence rate, physiological measures and olfactory tests. Although one of the included studies suggests that ESS is more effective than systemic steroids based on endoscopic appearances alone (a secondary outcome), one positive finding from amongst several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. Therefore, there is inadequate evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the most appropriate treatment for this condition and the timing thereof. While the surgical and medical treatments used appear to be similar in outcome, the risks of each must be considered. There is little available literature regarding the complications of medical treatment and the studies included in this review did not report any significant problems. A large national audit of sinonasal surgery has previously reported minor surgical complications in 6.6% and major complications in 0.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 2006</LINK>). Taking this into account, it seems reasonable to continue with the currently generally accepted practice of initial medical therapy for three months, followed by surgical treatment in cases refractory to this treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-19 09:28:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy of surgical versus medical treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Further research to investigate this problem, which has significant implications for quality of life and healthcare service usage, is justified. There is a need for randomised controlled trials in which surgical and medical treatments are directly compared, using a consistent surgical approach versus standardised medical therapy. Identical outcome measures should be used to make comparison and meta-analysis easier. A national (or international) multicentre trial would be ideal, in order to obtain sufficient numbers of participants, and long-term follow-up (at least six years) should be included if possible. Patient-reported outcome measures could include disease-specific health-related quality of life scores such as Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22), as well as generic health-related quality of life scores. Objective outcome measures could include endoscopic scores, olfaction tests and nasal nitric oxide levels, with more complex physiological measurements if felt appropriate. Agreed minor and major complications of both surgical and medical treatments should be specifically recorded to allow adequate evaluation of potential benefits versus risks. The timing of when to undertake surgical treatment in those who have failed to respond adequately to medical therapy also warrants investigation.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-11-12 10:05:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The title has changed from 'Medical versus surgical interventions for nasal polyps' to 'Surgical versus medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps', in accordance with current terminology (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkens-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkens 2012</LINK>), and usual practice (less invasive/first-line treatments as control).</P>
<P>We have further developed the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section regarding study selection. Initially, the primary outcome was "symptom scores"; we have expanded this into "disease severity, as measured by patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores", "health-related quality of life, using disease-specific health-related quality of life scores" and "health-related quality of life, using generic quality of life scores". The fourth secondary outcome was originally "physiological measures of nasal airway resistance, cross-sectional area, olfaction or ciliary function"; we have divided this into two separate secondary outcomes. The first is "objective physiological measures: nasal peak flow, nasal volume, nasal cross-sectional area, nasal nitric oxide (nNO), ciliary function" and the second is "olfactory tests". This was done because olfactory tests are by definition subjective.</P>
<P>We have also added the clarifying statement, "We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but they were not used as a basis for including or excluding studies", reflecting current standards.</P>
<P>We have explicitly stated that studies with a 'split-nose' design (i.e. one side of the nose is treated with one surgical technique and the other side is treated with another) were excluded from the review due to their high risk of bias, as ongoing inflammation on one side may affect the rate of recurrence on the contralateral side, thus confounding a particular surgical technique.</P>
<P>We have adopted the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for study quality assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have provided more detail on data synthesis methods.</P>
<P>We have included a 'Summary of findings' table and described the method used.</P>
