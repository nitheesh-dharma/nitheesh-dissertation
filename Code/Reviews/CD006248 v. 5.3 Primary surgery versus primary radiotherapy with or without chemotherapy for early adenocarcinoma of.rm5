<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:22:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Astrid Baalbergen">
<P>For early squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, the outcome is similar after either primary surgery or primary radiotherapy. There are reports that this is not the case for early adenocarcinoma (AC) of the uterine cervix: some studies have reported that the outcome is better after primary surgery. There are no systematic reviews about surgery versus chemoradiation in the treatment of cervical cancer. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD006248. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006248.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-10-30 21:19:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Astrid Baalbergen">
<P>The objectives of this review were to compare the effectiveness and safety of primary surgery for early stage AC of the uterine cervix with primary radiotherapy or chemoradiation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:22:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2009, MEDLINE (1950 to July week 5, 2009), EMBASE (1980 to week 32, 2009) and we also searched the related articles feature of PubMed and the Web of Science. We also checked the reference lists of articles. For this update, the searches were re-run in June 2012: MEDLINE 2009 to June week 2, 2012, EMBASE 2009 to 2012 week 24, CENTRAL Issue 6, 2012, Cochrane Gynaecological Specialised Register June 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-11-04 11:53:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Studies of treatment of patients with early AC of the uterine cervix were included. Treatment included surgery, surgery followed by radiotherapy, radiotherapy and chemoradiation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:21:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Astrid Baalbergen">
<P>Forty-three studies were selected by the search strategy and 30 studies were excluded. Twelve studies were considered for inclusion. Except for one randomised controlled trial (RCT), all other studies were retrospective cohort studies with variable methodological quality and had limitations of a retrospective study. Comparing the results from these retrospective studies was not possible due to diverging treatment strategies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Analysis of a subgroup of one RCT showed that surgery for early cervical AC was better than radiotherapy. However, the majority of operated patients required adjuvant radiotherapy, which is associated with greater morbidity. Furthermore, the radiotherapy in this study was not optimal, and surgery was not compared to chemoradiation, which is currently recommended in most centres. Finally, modern imaging techniques (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positive emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) scanning) allow better selection of patients and node-negative patients can now be more easily identified for surgery, thereby reducing the risk of 'double trouble' caused by surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy.  </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:21:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We recommend surgery for early-stage AC of the uterine cervix in carefully staged patients. Primary chemoradiation remains a second best alternative for patients unfit for surgery; chemoradiation is probably first choice in patients with (MRI or PET-CT-suspected) positive lymph nodes. Since the last version of this review no new studies were found.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:21:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD006248. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006248.</P>
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2004</LINK>). The prognosis of patients with cervical cancer depends on FIGO (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians) (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2001</LINK>) stage at time of diagnosis, presence of lymph node metastases, tumour size and histological type (<LINK REF="STD-Baalbergen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baalbergen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasamatsu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasamatsu 2009</LINK>). The three major histological types of invasive cervical cancer are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), adenocarcinomas (AC) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC). SCC comprises 80% of cases, and AC and ASC comprise approximately 15% (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2002</LINK>). Over the past 40 years the relative proportion and absolute incidence of AC compared to SCC has increased, especially in women younger than 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-Alfsen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfsen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krane 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoolland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoolland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vizcaino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vizcaino 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Screening for SCC has effectively reduced both incidence and mortality of invasive squamous cancer by early detection and treatment of pre-invasive lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>). Although screening reduces mortality from cervical AC, the incidence remains unaltered (<LINK REF="REF-Nieminen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieminen 1995</LINK>). It remains controversial whether or not patients with AC have a worse prognosis. The literature is inconsistent; some studies report a similar prognosis for AC of the uterine cervix and SCC (<LINK REF="REF-Grisaru-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grisaru 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishikawa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishikawa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilgore-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kilgore 1988</LINK>) whereas others report a poorer prognosis for AC (<LINK REF="REF-Bulk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bulk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eifel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eifel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hopkins-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hopkins 1991</LINK>). Questions remain about what factors account for this apparent poorer prognosis. Cervical AC may metastasise earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Lea-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lea 2002</LINK>) or may be detected later (<LINK REF="REF-Drescher-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drescher 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1977</LINK>). It may respond less well to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1977</LINK>), have a higher incidence of relapse and the treatment of recurrent disease less successful (<LINK REF="REF-Kasamatsu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasamatsu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1999</LINK>) or possibly the inclusion of special subtypes such as clear cell carcinoma could account for this difference in prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Look-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Look 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:22:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Treatment protocols used for SCC and AC are similar and therapy is based on clinical staging according to FIGO (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2001</LINK>). Due to recent developments in imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and developments of surgical techniques such as endoscopy, the current FIGO classification for cervical cancer has been revised (<LINK REF="REF-Pecorelli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecorelli 2009</LINK>). Micro-invasive disease is managed by cone biopsy or hysterectomy. Radical hysterectomy (removal of the uterus with adjacent tissue and draining pelvic lymph nodes) has become standard management for the majority of early cervical cancers, but external beam irradiation along with a vaginal application of brachytherapy to the cervix has been increasingly employed for bulky stage I and II disease (tumour diameter of more than four centimetres). Both external beam irradiation and brachytherapy have undergone rapid developments, of which the therapeutic consequences are not yet clear. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows more conformal external beam dose delivery to the clinical target (uterine cervix and regional pelvic lymph nodes) thereby sparing critical organs (bladder and intestines). IMRT requires an accurate definition and delineation of clinical target (<LINK REF="REF-Small-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vizcaino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vizcaino 1998</LINK>). Paradoxically, in clinical practice, compared to 'old fashioned' four-field box-technique defined by osseous anatomical structures (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1973</LINK>), image-guided target definition has increased rather than decreased the irradiated volumes for radiotherapy of pelvic tumours. The historical low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy techniques using radium and caesium have largely been replaced by iridium as the radioactive source. Iridium allows high dose rate (HDR) and pulsed dose rate (PDR), which both have decreased irradiation time and patient burden. These techniques, particularly if combined with intraoperative MRI, have reduced the risk of misplacement of the brachytherapy applicator, and allow image-guided brachytherapy, thereby increasing local control whilst reducing toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Georg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georg 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>After primary surgery, it may be useful to add radiotherapy (in up to 50% of operated patients depending on the selection criteria of the series). In primary radiotherapy in selected cases, adjuvant surgery (salvage hysterectomy) may be performed if the tumour recurs locally (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1975</LINK>). The use of both surgery and radiotherapy leads to more severe morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Barter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1997</LINK>) than either used alone. Complications of radical hysterectomy are chronic bladder dysfunction (3% to 13%), ureterovaginal or vesicovaginal fistula (1% to 2%), pulmonary embolism (1% to 2%), small bowel obstruction (1%), lymphocoele formation (5% to 8%) and hydroureter nephrosis (3%). Complications of radiotherapy arise later but are often permanent: proctitis (7.6%), radiation colitis, early menopause, sexual dysfunction, shortening and fibrosis of the vagina, oedema of the legs (0.6%), hydroureter nephrosis (5%) and vesicovaginal fistula (1.4%). The combination of radical surgery followed by radiotherapy carries the worst morbidity: hydroureter nephrosis (10%), severe oedema of the legs (9%), lymphocoele formation (15%), ureterovaginal or vesicovaginal fistula (7.4%) and vesical complications and bowel morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Boronow-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boronow 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kucera-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kucera 1998</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waggoner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waggoner 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>In 1999, after the publication of four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Keys-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keys 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rose-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 1999</LINK>) the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) issued an alert indicating that combined chemoradiation should be considered for all patients with cervical cancer who previously would be treated with radiotherapy. In 2001, a Cochrane review showed concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in locally advanced cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>For included studies, data on characteristics of patients and interventions (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), study quality and end points were abstracted independently by two review authors (AB and YV) onto data abstraction forms (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) that were developed for the review. Differences between review authors were resolved by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (AA) if necessary. No effort was made to blind the review authors of names of investigators, institutions, journals, etc. The data abstraction forms were designed a priori and were filled out independently.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Data on the type of surgery was be collected. Details of dose and fractionation of external beam radiotherapy and details of the brachytherapy dose, insertions and dose rate were collected.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>For time to event (OS and recurrence-free survival) data, we extracted the log of the hazard ratio [log(HR)] and its standard error from trial reports; if these were not reported, we attempted to estimate them from other reported statistics using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. adverse events or deaths) if it was not possible to use an HR, we extracted the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest and the number of patients assessed at end point, in order to estimate a risk ratio (RR). For continuous outcomes (e.g. QoL), we extracted the final value and standard deviation (SD) of the outcome of interest and the number of patients assessed at end point in each treatment arm at the end of follow-up, in order to estimate the mean difference (MD) (if trials measured outcomes on the same scale) or standardised mean differences (SMD) (if trials measured outcomes on different scales) between treatment arms and its standard error. If reported, both unadjusted and adjusted statistics were extracted. Where possible, all data extracted were those relevant to an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, in which participants were analysed in groups to which they were assigned. The time points at which outcomes were collected and reported were noted.</P>

<P>Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots, by estimation of the percentage heterogeneity between trials that could not be ascribed to sampling variation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) and by a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of the significance of the heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>), irrespective of whether HRs or odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. If there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity, the possible reasons for this were investigated and reported.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:24:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>For meta-analysis of the time-to-event outcomes (OS and PFS), the most appropriate statistic is the HR. If provided in a trial report, the HR and associated variance were used directly in the meta-analysis. Alternatively, using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>, they were estimated indirectly from other summary statistics (95% confidence intervals (CI), P values, total number of events) or from data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). Where feasible, a number of methods were used to estimate the trial HR indirectly, to check its reliability. The estimated HRs were then combined across all trials using the generic inverse variance facility in RevMan 5 software to give a pooled HR (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). This represents the overall risk of an event with surgery versus radiotherapy.</P>
<P>In some papers only overall rates of local and distant recurrence were presented rather than a time-to-event analysis of these events. Therefore, only an OR of the rates of recurrence could be calculated, with no account being taken of the time to recurrence or any censoring. Data for recurrence were extracted from the text and the OR calculated from the total number of patients and the observed number of recurrences in each arm. The ORs for individual trials were then combined across all trials. These ORs indicate the odds of a local or distant recurrence in the surgery arm versus the radiotherapy arm.</P>
<P>Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests were also used to assess the consistency of effect across different subsets of trials and were referred to as Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for interaction. Pooling of data was only done if there was no clinical heterogeneity and if there were outcomes that could be combined. In the absence of statistical heterogeneity, a fixed-effect model was used; if there was statistical heterogeneity a random-effects model was used. Where pooling was not appropriate, the results of eligible trials was discussed in a narrative form. Ideally the analysis was on an ITT basis.</P>

<P>As it was known to us that only a small number, if any, of RCTs had been published, we also incorporated other types of studies in this review, that is prospective observational studies, case-control studies and studies with historic controls.</P>
<P>Forty-three possible eligible studies were retrieved for more detailed information.

<P>We found only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1997</LINK>), which is described in detail in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. This study was a prospective RCT of radiotherapy versus surgery in stage IB-IIA cervical cancer from 1986 to 1991, in patients referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo, University of Milan. Of the 468 eligible patients, a high percentage, 27% (N = 125) were excluded because of age (N = 43), medical illness (N = 54), former or concurrent malignancy (N = 21), or doctors or patients preference for a primary therapy (N = 7). Women under 30 years of age were excluded, the mean age in the study was 50 years.</P>
<P>This study included 46 patients with AC. Twenty-six patients had primary surgery and 20 had primary radiotherapy. A relatively high percentage of the primary surgery patients had adjuvant radiotherapy (64%).</P>
<P>Primary surgery was uniform. Surgery consisted of a class III radical hysterectomy as described by <LINK REF="REF-Piver-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piver 1974</LINK>. Adjuvant radiotherapy was given as a precaution for the following pathological risk factors: stage was greater than FIGO stage IIA, less than 3 mm of uninvolved cervical stroma, cut through or lymph node metastases. Adjuvant radiotherapy consisted of external pelvic irradiation, with a total dose of 50.4 Gy over five to six weeks. Sixty-four per cent (108 out of 170) of the surgery group received adjuvant radiotherapy, which is high compared to the percentages of 9% to 38% cited in literature (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1994</LINK>). For the 26 AC patients who had primary surgery and received adjuvant radiotherapy similar details were not provided.</P>
<P>Primary radiotherapy included external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by a multi-portal technique. The median total dose was 47 Gy (range 40 to 53). After two weeks one caesium-137 LDR insertion was given. The median total dose at point A (external beam plus brachytherapy) was 76 Gy (range70 to 90).</P>
<P>When lymphangiography showed common iliac or para aortic metastases, para aortic lymph nodes were treated with a radiotherapy dose of 45 Gy over five weeks. A boost of 5 to 10 Gy was given to the positive lymph nodes. In the surgery group, lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 patients (14%). Six of these 24 patients showed no lymph-node metastases in the surgical specimen. Whereas 27 of the 145 patients in the lymphangiography-negative surgery group also had nodal metastases. If nodal tumour metastases were discovered at the time of an attempted radical hysterectomy, some surgeons completed the radical hysterectomy while other surgeons abandoned it and patients were treated by radiotherapy. It was not described in this study how these patients were allocated, to the primary surgery or the primary radiotherapy group.</P>
<P>Median follow-up was 87 months (range 57 to 120). No patient was lost to follow-up. The outcomes assessed were the five-year survival, rate and pattern of complications, and recurrences associated with each primary therapy.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:25:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There was no survival benefit for either arm for all cervical cancer patients, but the multivariate (subgroup) analysis showed a marginally significant advantage in OS in the 46 AC patients after primary surgery compared to primary radiotherapy (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.26; P = 0.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). OS was only just significantly better after primary surgery (70%) versus primary radiotherapy (59%). It is not clear if this minor difference could be explained by the average higher age of the radiotherapy group. The DFS was 66% after primary surgery and 47% after primary radiotherapy (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.43; P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most complications were described after combination therapy. In the surgery group (surgery only and surgery plus radiotherapy), 48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2 to 3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment, compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group (OR 3.32; 95% CI 0.61 to 18.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). After surgery only 16% of the patients had short-term morbidity and 24% had long-term morbidity. After surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy these percentages were 20% and 29%, respectively, and after radiotherapy alone were 7% and 16%, respectively. Owing to the high percentage of adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery, and as a result of combining treatment, the morbidity was relatively high in the surgery arm. The study gave the complication data for the whole group but not for AC separately.</P>

<P>For early-stage AC surgery was better than radiotherapy. The majority of operated patients required adjuvant radiotherapy. Combined therapy (surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy) gave the highest complications and morbidity. The radiotherapy used in this study was not optimal.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:25:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We have found only one RCT for this review. It included 46 patients with AC. The mean age of patients in the study was high (50 years) compared to that in other studies (43 to 47 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eifel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Eifel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilgore-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kilgore 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nola-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nola 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saigo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saigo 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of the high percentage of patients excluded before randomisation due to age or medical illness, the results for this study apply only for relatively healthy patients in the age range 30 to 70 years.</P>
<P>The patients received a relatively low radiation dose (median dose: 76 Gy; range 70 to 90). According to the recommendation of the American Brachytherapy Society, the total dose to 'point A' in stage IB-IIA diseases should be in the range of 80 to 85 Gy (<LINK REF="REF-Nag-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nag 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study was performed from 1986 to 1991. At that time, it was not standard practice to combine chemotherapy with radiotherapy in the treatment cervical cancer patients. Since then, concurrent chemoradiation in either definitive or postoperative setting has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peters-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>The quantity and quality of the evidence was scarce and only one RCT was found (<LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1997</LINK>), which included only 46 patients with AC from 337 cervical cancer patients. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:25:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Analysis of a subgroup of the single RCT showed that surgery for early-stage AC was better than radiotherapy. However, the majority of the surgery group patients required adjuvant radiotherapy, which was associated with greater morbidity. Furthermore, radiotherapy was not optimised and surgery was not compared to chemoradiation, which is currently recommended in most centres. Finally, modern imaging techniques (MRI, PET-CT), allow for better patient selection enabling node-negative patients to be more easily identified for surgery, thereby reducing the risk of morbidity associated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy.  <BR/>
<BR/>In conclusion, we recommend surgery for early-stage AC of the uterine cervix in carefully staged patients. Whereas primary chemoradiation remains a second best alternative for patients unfit for surgery and chemoradiation probably is first choice in patients with (MRI or PET-CT-suspected) positive lymph nodes.</P>
<P>Since the last version of this review no new studies were found.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-05 12:25:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is a need for well-designed RCTs comparing primary surgery versus primary radiotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy for early AC. This can only be carried out in women who do not need fertility-sparing treatment.</P>
