<P>Radiotherapy (as commonly used in the treatment of cancer) has been proposed as a treatment for wet AMD as it may prevent the growth of new vessels in the retina. This review identified 14 randomised controlled trials of radiotherapy for wet AMD. Most of these trials showed effects (not always significant) that favoured treatment with radiotherapy to prevent vision loss. However, overall this review does not provide convincing evidence that radiotherapy is an effective treatment for wet AMD, in part because the results of different trials were inconsistent, but also because it is possible that the treatment effects could be explained by the fact that it was not possible to mask the participants, and people measuring outcome, to the treatment group. The incidence of adverse effects reported in these trials was low - nobody developed any radiation-specific side effects although in three trials higher rates of cataract were reported in the radiotherapy group.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-12-01 13:43:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials in which radiotherapy was compared to another treatment, sham treatment, low dosage irradiation or no treatment in people with choroidal neovascularisation secondary to AMD.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-26 12:03:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted the data. We combined relative risks using a random-effects model. We estimated the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity, rather than sampling error, using I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:07:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Thirteen trials (n=1154) investigated external beam radiotherapy with dosages ranging from 7.5 to 24 Gy; one additional trial (n=88) used plaque brachytherapy (15Gy at 1.75mm for 54 minutes/12.6 Gy at 4mm for 11 minutes). Most studies found effects (not always significant) that favoured treatment. Overall there was a small statistically significant reduction in risk of visual acuity loss in the treatment group. There was considerable inconsistency between trials and the trials were considered to be at risk of bias, in particular because of the lack of masking of treatment group. Subgroup analyses did not reveal any significant interactions, however, there were small numbers of trials in each subgroup (range three to five). There was some indication that trials with no sham irradiation in the control group reported a greater effect of treatment. The incidence of adverse events was low in all trials; there were no reported cases of radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy or malignancy. Three trials found non-significant higher rates of cataract progression in the treatment group.</P>

<P>This review currently does not provide convincing evidence that radiotherapy is an effective treatment for neovascular AMD. If further trials are to be considered to evaluate radiotherapy in AMD then adequate masking of the control group must be considered. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:28:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The macula, the central area of the retina, is used for detailed vision such as reading, recognising faces and driving. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. It is difficult to get a clear definition of AMD. The term 'age-related' is used partly due to its unknown pathogenesis. It is believed that both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of the disease. From a clinical perspective, AMD primarily affects the macular region. The term 'degeneration' is used to distinguish AMD from other genetic macular dystrophies which run in families and those where there is a clear environmental cause such as an infection or trauma.</P>
<P>There are several signs appearing in the retina that are associated with increasing age and increased risk of developing AMD. These signs, known as age-related maculopathy (ARM), include the presence of drusen (yellow spots beneath the retina), pigmentary disturbance and small focal areas of atrophy. In general, ARM is not associated with significant visual loss. Some people with ARM will go on to develop AMD.</P>
<P>There are two types of AMD: geographic atrophy (large area of atrophy centred in the macula) and choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) also known as wet AMD. This review is concerned with treatment for neovascular AMD.</P>
<P>In neovascular AMD, CNV develops beneath the retina. In the initial phase the CNV might cause visual distortion due to leakage of fluid into the surrounding retina. At this stage the retinal function is only mildly affected and the CNV is potentially reversible. However, the CNV may leak serum lipid and protein leading to exudation and significant swelling of the retina. The CNV may bleed and the haemorrhages may be toxic. Both exudation and haemorrhages induce a scarring response. These are associated with extensive damage to the architecture of the retina-retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex, leading to significant visual loss.</P>
<P>Choroidal neovascularisation is defined as classic or occult according to its appearance on fluorescein angiography, where fluorescent dye is injected intravenously and imaged as it passes through the blood vessels of the eye. Classic membranes are clearly delineated and can be seen at the early frames of the angiogram. Occult membranes present as either late leakage, which cannot be seen in the early frames, or fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment. Most lesions have both classic and occult components.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-26 12:03:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Radiotherapy is commonly used in oncology and its use is increasing in the treatment of non-neoplastic diseases. It is believed that it can preferentially damage dividing and fast growing cells more than normal supporting cells. In rats, photoreceptor cell death is not seen at doses less than 10 Gy and the retinal pigment epithelial cell loss does not occur under 20 Gy in single-fraction. There is also evidence to suggest that fractionation of irradiation greatly reduces the toxicity but preserves the DNA-damaging effects in rapidly dividing cells.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Clinical experience suggests that cumulative doses of up to 25 Gy cause no damage to the retina or optic nerve. As the endothelial cells in CNV are dividing it is possible that radiotherapy can stop the growth of CNV without significant damage to the retina.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-26 12:03:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There are several RCTs of radiotherapy for neovascular AMD using different dosage and fractionation schemes. The aim of this review was to assess systematically the results of these studies with a view to providing an overall estimate of treatment effect.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:42:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed study quality according to methods set out in Section 6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>
<I>)</I>. The review authors were not masked to any trial details during the assessment. We considered four parameters of quality when grading the articles: allocation concealment and method of allocation to treatment; masking of providers and recipients of care; masking of outcome assessment; and completeness of follow up. We graded each parameter of trial quality: A - adequate; B - unclear; or C - inadequate. We resolved disagreement between the review authors on assessments by discussion. We contacted the trial authors for clarification on any parameter graded B - unclear. We excluded any trial scoring C - inadequate on allocation concealment and method of allocation to treatment.</P>
<P>For the update in 2009, we used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We assessed the extent to which bias could have been introduced in the following aspects of study design and execution: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (masking), incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:42:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The primary outcome of visual acuity loss was assessed at six, 12 and 24 months. We used two outcomes, loss of 3 or more lines on a logMAR chart and loss of 6 or more lines. As the proportion of people experiencing these outcomes was high in the control group (more than 10%) we used the relative risk as our effect measure. Not all trials reported visual acuity outcomes in this dichotomous format. We contacted investigators for data but these requests were not successful. We, therefore, also included mean visual acuity and change in visual acuity as a continuous score.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Most studies randomised participants and then studied one eye per person. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jaakkola-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jaakkola 2005</LINK>) reported data from 88 eyes in 86 participants. As the numbers of people with both eyes erroneously included in the analysis was small in this study, and it was not possible to extract data for people, this error was ignored and data on eyes used in the analysis. For one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kacperek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kacperek 2001</LINK>) it was not clear how the analysis was done but data could not be extracted for the review in any case.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Our main analyses assume that missing data is missing at random. However, to see how reasonable this assumption might be we also did sensitivity analyses with different assumptions about the missing data using methods as set out by White et al (<LINK REF="REF-White-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2008</LINK>). The "informative missingness odds ratio" (IMOR) refers to the ratio of the odds of the outcome among participants for whom data were missing and the odds of the outcome among participants who were observed. These IMORs can be assumed to be equal or different in the two trial arms. We did four sensitivity analyses. Firstly we assumed the IMOR was 2 in treatment and control groups i.e. that people who were not seen were twice as likely to have the outcome. Secondly, we assumed that the IMOR was ½ in both treatment and control groups i.e. that people who were not seen were half as likely to have the outcome. For the third and fourth sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the IMOR was opposite in treatment and control groups - i.e. 2 or ½.</P>
<P>All analyses were done using the <I>metamiss</I> command in Stata (version 10.1, StataCorp LP, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, TX 77845 USA).</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-05-07 13:05:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity by looking at the forest plots to see whether the confidence intervals for the estimates of effect overlapped and by looking at the &#967;<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP> value. </P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:46:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We planned to investigate publication bias by doing a scatter plot of the effect estimates from the individual studies against their standard error. An asymmetric graph may indicate that smaller studies that are not statistically significant have not been published although it also may indicate that the effects of treatment are different in small studies. Currently not enough trials are included in the analyses to assess publication bias.</P>
<P>We investigated selective outcome reporting by doing an "outcome matrix" and classifying missing outcomes according to the ORBIT classification (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkham 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A: States outcome analysed but only reported that the treatment differences were not statistically significant<BR/>B: States outcome analysed but only reported that treatment differences were significant<BR/>C: Clear that outcome was analysed but insufficient data presented to be included in meta-analysis or full tabulation<BR/>D: Clear that outcome was analysed but no results reported<BR/>E: Clear that outcome was measured (for example, includes structurally related outcomes) but not necessarily analysed<BR/>F: States that outcome was not measured<BR/>G: Not mentioned but clinical judgement says likely to have been measured<BR/>H: Not mentioned but clinical judgement says unlikely to have been measured<BR/>I: Other give details</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:46:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We used a random-effects model to combine results.</P>
<P>There was considerable statistical heterogeneity between studies. However, the amount of heterogeneity varied with the outcome. We have included the pooled analyses and I<SUP>2</SUP> estimates on the graphs for information but have not reported the pooled results in the abstract.</P>
<P>There were not enough data reported for other potential outcome measures (growth of new vessels, contrast sensitivity and quality of life) to enable a statistical analysis but these are discussed in the results section.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-03-31 19:11:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Not all of the trials reported data for all outcomes. This meant that our options for exploring the sources of heterogeneity were limited. In our protocol we specified three factors of interest for subgroup analyses (method of delivery, dosage and type of CNV). All but one trial used the same method of delivery. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the details of dosage in these trials. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> shows the details of CNV.</P>
<P>During the course of doing the review we identified one additional aspect of study design as of interest for subgroup analysis. This was whether or not sham irradiation was carried out in the control group.</P>
<P>Using these factors we performed stratified analyses, the purpose of which was to determine whether the outcome varied significantly with type of explanatory variable. We used data from the 12 month follow-up and divided the trials into two groups for each factor: high dose (more than 14 Gy) versus low dose (less than or equal to 14 Gy); 50% or more of participants with classic CNV versus less than 50% with classic CNV; and trials with no sham irradiation versus those with sham irradiation. As the numbers of trials were small and the purpose of this analysis was to compare treatment effects only, we used odds ratios pooled using a fixed-effect model. We calculated an 'interaction effect' (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>) i.e. compared the pooled odds ratio in the two subgroups.</P>

In one study (<LINK REF="STD-SFRADS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">SFRADS 2002</LINK>) a strictly intention-to-treat analysis was not performed as one patient randomised to the control group received treatment and was analysed in the treatment group.

<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK> show the sensitivity analyses making different assumptions as to risk of outcome in people not seen. Five different assumptions are shown:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Missing at random (available case analysis)</LI>
<LI>Odds of outcome in not observed twice odds of outcome in observed in treatment and control groups</LI>
<LI>Odds of outcome in not observed half odds of outcome in observed in treatment and control groups</LI>
<LI>Odds of outcome in not observed twice odds of outcome in observed in treatment group and odds of outcome in not observed half odds of outcome in observed in control group</LI>
<LI>Odds of outcome in not observed half odds of outcome in observed in treatment group and odds of outcome in not observed twice odds of outcome in observed in control group</LI>
</UL>
<P>The pooled estimates did not appear to be at substantial risk of bias due to missing data in the included studies (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>). The pooled risk ratio, under various assumptions about the risk of outcome in people who were not observed, varied on average by less than 10% from the available case analysis. The exception to this was loss of 6+ lines at six months where making more extreme assumptions about outcome in people who were not seen resulted in approximately 15% change in the pooled risk ratio. If we assume that the odds of the outcome in people in the treatment group who were not seen was twice that of the people who were seen, and that the odds of the outcome in people in the control group who were not seen was only half that of people who were seen, the observed risk ratio showing a beneficial effect becomes non-statistically significant.</P>

This assumption, for some outcomes, leads to a change in risk ratio of greater than 10%.</P>

With regard to the pooled analyses, we are interested in whether our conclusions would change as a result of different assumptions about reasons for data being missing. Overall, the size and statistical significance of the effect was similar in the available case analyses (data missing at random) and assuming that there was a different risk of outcome in non-observed people (see table below). There were a few exceptions to this, however the differences were still relatively small and the fact that the statistical significance changed probably reflects the fact these were borderline cases anyway and the upper confidence interval was close to 1 (no effect).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Visual acuity as a continuous outcome</HEADING>
<P>Not all trials reported visual acuity outcomes in a dichotomous format. In order to include data from the trials that did not, we also collected data on logMAR visual acuity as a continuous variable. These data were available for most trials at 12 months, either as mean visual acuity at follow-up or change in visual acuity since the start of the trial (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There was less heterogeneity in these outcomes. For example, for the trials reporting change in visual acuity, the I<SUP>2</SUP> value was 15%. The pooled weighted mean difference was -0.10 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.04). These results were consistent with a mean change in visual acuity of 1.5 lines of visual acuity in favour of the treated group to approximately one third of a line of visual acuity in favour of the treatment group.</P>
<P>These analyses may be at risk of selective outcome bias because continuous data may be analysed two ways - as final visual acuity or change in visual acuity from baseline. It is possible that the choice of which outcome to present was influenced by the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>With only 14 trials included in the review, and only some of these trials providing data for some outcomes, our ability to determine the causes of the heterogeneity or inconsistency between trials was limited. Using the factors prespecified in the protocol (dosage and type of CNV) and one factor not prespecified in the protocol (sham irradiation in the control group) we performed stratified analyses for the visual acuity outcome (3 or more lines lost) at 12 months (because this was the time period for which most data were available) (<I>see</I> '<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>'). There were no statistically significant interactions. There was some indication that trials with no sham irradiation reported a greater effect of treatment as did trials with a greater percentage of participants with classic CNV. There was little evidence for any effect of dosage. <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK> shows the forest plot for the subgroup analysis by dosage with trials ordered according to dosage (highest dosage at top and lowest dosage at bottom of plot). There was little evidence for any trend in effect of radiotherapy according to dosage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Our secondary outcome measures included change in membrane size and contrast sensitivity. Of the trials that specifically studied change in lesion size a beneficial outcome for treatment was found by one (<LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 2000</LINK>). No difference in the growth rate between treatment and controls were reported by four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergink-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bergink 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Char-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Char 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valmaggia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Valmaggia 2002</LINK>). Of the trials that specifically studied changes in contrast sensitivity, <LINK REF="STD-SFRADS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">SFRADS 2002</LINK> reported a statistically significant difference in the loss of 0.3 log units of contrast sensitivity in favour of treatment at 24 months but not three months. No statistically significant difference in contrast sensitivity between treated and control groups was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>Quality of life outcomes were reported in <LINK REF="STD-SFRADS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">SFRADS 2002</LINK>. Visual functioning was assessed by the Daily Living Tasks Dependent on Vision (DLTV) questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK>). There were no differences between treatment and control groups on any dimension of the DLTV 12 or 24 months after treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of adverse events was low in all the trials reviewed.</P>
<P>Three trials found slightly higher rates of cataract progression in the treatment groups but this was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RAD-1999" TYPE="STUDY">RAD 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no reported cases of radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy or the development of malignancy. However, the duration of follow-up was likely to be too short to detect this. Given the mean age of participants this may not be a major concern.</P>
<P>Although there was an overall beneficial effect for treatment with regard to vision, <LINK REF="STD-Bergink-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bergink 1998</LINK> reported a drop in central vision with a loss of 3 or more lines in a substantial proportion of patients in the treatment group. This was not reported by trials using standard fractions (2 Gy) in the treatment protocol.</P>
<P>Other complications reported in the treatment group included one case of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and one case of a large non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2001</LINK>); transient conjunctival injection in two participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 2000</LINK>); and transient disturbance of the precorneal tear film, found to be significant (<LINK REF="STD-SFRADS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">SFRADS 2002</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-31 19:06:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-31 19:04:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We identified 14 trials of the effect of radiotherapy on neovascular AMD, which randomised 1242 participants. One of these trials studied plaque brachytherapy, the rest external beam radiotherapy. Not all of these trials could be included in each of our planned analyses because of differences in the way outcomes were presented and follow-up times. <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> summarises the effects of radiotherapy on visual loss at 12 months follow-up. Overall the quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. There was some evidence for an effect of radiotherapy on severe visual acuity loss (loss of 6+ lines) over 12 months with a statistically significant 40% relative risk reduction. However, this effect was not seen for more moderate visual loss (loss of 3+ lines) and was not maintained at 24 months. However, it must be noted that different trials contribute to these analyses. However, when repeating the analyses for 6+ lines using only three trials that had data for 12 and 24 months a similar pattern was observed.</P>
<P>There was considerable clinical and statistical inconsistency between trials. Most trials found effects that favoured treatment, but these were not always significant. The exception was <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2001</LINK> which consistently found non-significant effects that favoured the control group. It is difficult to ascertain why this trial should be different but it had sham irradiation in the control group and a very low percentage of participants with classic CNV (12%).</P>
<P>With only 14 trials in the review and differences between trials in terms of outcome reporting it was difficult to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses comparing groups of trials with different attributes (i.e. low versus high dosage; low versus high percentage with classic CNV; and sham irradiation versus observation of the control group) did not reveal any statistically significant interactions. With small numbers of trials in each subgroup (range three to five) this was not surprising.</P>
<P>It is encouraging that there were no significant adverse effects noted with up to 20 Gy of radiotherapy deployed in 2 Gy fractions. The occurrence of severe visual loss in some treated patients receiving 24 Gy in larger fractions questions the safety of higher doses. Higher doses of radiation are associated with greater morbidity such as radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy. Given the lack of a clear benefit of higher doses it cannot be assumed that these may be used safely in clinical practice. The long-term risk to the fellow eye from collateral radiation exposure also needs to be determined.<BR/>
<BR/>Neovascular AMD is a heterogenous disease with variation in CNV composition and disease presentation. Differences in lesion composition, size and time in the natural history at presentation may be a source of variability when assessing treatment outcome among the different trials. Evidence from the TAP (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-Study-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP Study 1999</LINK>) and VIP (<LINK REF="REF-Bressler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bressler 2002</LINK>) trials showed that many people with minimally classic (less than 50% classic) and occult with no classic lesions had relatively good natural history. Despite presenting as large lesions, they maintained reasonably good visual acuity throughout 24 months follow up without treatment. In contrast, the majority of predominantly classic (more than 50% classic) lesions were four disc areas or less and were more likely to present with lower visual acuity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 2000</LINK> found a significant treatment benefit in participants with smaller CNV (less than 1.5 mm<SUP>2</SUP>) with regard to smaller increase in lesion size and significantly smaller decrease in LogMAR visual acuity for over two years. They also found that there was no significant difference in visual outcome in participants with larger CNV (more than 1.5 mm<SUP>2</SUP>). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2001</LINK> did not find lesion size (less than one to more than six disc areas) determined treatment outcome. When the composition of the lesion was considered, <LINK REF="STD-Bergink-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bergink 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 2000</LINK> found a better treatment outcome for occult lesions. <LINK REF="STD-SFRADS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">SFRADS 2002</LINK> suggested that one possible reason for the negative outcome in their trial was the predominance of wholly classic and predominantly classic subgroups. This finding was not supported by the other trials included in this review.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-03-09 13:41:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Although there are 14 trials published, because of the different dosages used, and different outcome measures and follow-up times reported, the overall completeness of the evidence is less than might be expected from the number of trials. It is possible that there is an optimum treatment regime that has not yet been identified.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-05-13 15:06:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>It is possible that a moderate treatment benefit from radiotherapy exists in terms of prevention of severe visual loss. However, considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity between published trials makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. It is also possible that the moderate treatment effects seen could be explained by biases in the way that the studies were conducted. Overall, we can say that the results of this review do not currently support the use of radiotherapy in people with neovascular AMD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-13 15:06:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>Future trials should have a sufficient sample size to detect moderate effects and should report data on visual acuity outcomes so as to enable their inclusion in systematic overviews. Consistent reporting of data on factors such as lesion size and composition would also facilitate synthesis. Adequate masking of the treatment groups should be considered a priority. It is possible that radiotherapy may have a role as adjunctive treatment in conjunction with pharmacological treatments. </P>

<P>*Char 1991: Small study of 27 patients. Individual visual acuity data at baseline and last follow-up only reported. Average follow-up 14 months, range 0 to 32 months. Data extracted for the review on mean VA and assumed related approximately to 12 month follow-up. Other analyses e.g., of loss of 3+ lines etc theoretically possible but probably meaningless.</P>
<P>A: States outcome analysed but only reported the P-value &gt; 0.05 i.e.. NS.<BR/>E: Clear that outcome was measured (for example, includes structurally related outcomes) but not necessarily analysed.<BR/>H: Not mentioned but clinical judgement says unlikely to have been measured (adapted from list provided by Paula Williamson at Cochrane training workshop on selective outcome reporting bias, Edinburgh March 2009).</P>
