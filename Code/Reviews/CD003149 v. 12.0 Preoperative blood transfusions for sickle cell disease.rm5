<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-06 12:42:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to determine if blood transfusions given to people with sickle cell disease before routine or emergency surgery prevent complications due to sickle cell disease or surgery without causing any severe side effects. We also wanted to determine if any particular type of transfusion regimen is better in people with sickle cell disease undergoing surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. The disorder mainly affects people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian origin.</P>
<P>Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid and crescent shaped. Sickled cells are not only less flexible than healthy red blood cells, they are also stickier. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal blood cells are more fragile and break apart, which leads to a shortage of red blood cells, known as anaemia.</P>
<P>People with sickle cell disease are more likely to require surgery than the general population because of complications due to sickle cell disease, such as gallstones, infections, and joint problems. However, surgery can lead to sickle cell-related complications.</P>
<P>Blood transfusions before an operation may help prevent complications by reducing the level of anaemia, diluting the sickled red blood cells, and increasing the level of oxygen in the blood.This may reduce the risk of blood vessels becoming blocked causing further damage.</P>
<P>There are different types of blood transfusions. The main aim of an aggressive transfusion regimen is to reduce the number of sickled cells in the blood to below a certain level (usually sickled cells are removed and donor red cells given (exchange transfusion)), it also reduces the level of anaemia. The main aim of a conservative transfusion regimen is to reduce the level of anaemia, it also reduces the percentage of sickled cells in the blood (dilution effect) but no sickled cells are removed. An aggressive transfusion regimen decreases the percentage of sickled cells in the blood to a much lower level than a conservative transfusion regimen.</P>
<P>Blood transfusions can be linked to adverse events such as: the development of antibodies to proteins on donor red cells (alloimmunisation); accumulation of too much iron in the body from repeated transfusions; increased infection rates after surgery; and extended length of stay in hospital. Some types of surgery may not require blood transfusion.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature to 23 March 2016. We included three trials with 990 people in this review. One trial compared aggressive transfusion to conservative transfusion. Two trials compared aggressive or conservative transfusion before surgery to no transfusion. The majority of people within the trials had one form of sickle cell disease (HbSS). The majority of the operations were those considered to be at low or intermediate risk for causing sickle cell-related complications.</P>
<P>Two of the three trials received government funding, the third trial did not report the funding source.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no difference between giving a blood transfusion before surgery to reduce the number of sickled cells below a certain low level (aggressive transfusion regimen) and giving a blood transfusion to increase the number of red cells in the blood (conservative transfusion regimen) in preventing surgical or sickle-related complications immediately after surgery.</P>
<P>Giving a blood transfusion before surgery may prevent development of sickle-related lung problems. One trial was stopped early because more people developed sickle-related lung problems in the no transfusion arm; however, the other trial did not show a difference.There was no difference between giving a blood transfusion before surgery compared to not giving a blood transfusion before surgery in preventing any other sickle-related or surgical complications immediately after surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was rated as very low for this review's outcomes due to trials being at high risk of bias and because their was a small number of trials and a small number of participants included in the trials.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:34:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:24:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with sickle cell disease, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:24:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with sickle cell disease undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events.</P>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with sickle cell disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:28:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched for relevant trials in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 23 March 2016.</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 18 January 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with sickle cell disease undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-01-15 09:34:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:34:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions</B>
</P>
<P>One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/l). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar.</P>
<P>There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup.</P>
<P>There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing:</P>
<P>&#8226; an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);</P>
<P>&#8226; vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);</P>
<P>&#8226; serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);</P>
<P>&#8226; any perioperative complications, risk ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);</P>
<P>&#8226; a transfusion-related complication, risk ratio 1.85 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome.</P>
<P>There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred).</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, risk ratio 4.81 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants).</P>
<P>There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing:</P>
<P>&#8226; a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>&#8226; a serious infection, Peto odds ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low quality evidence);</P>
<P>&#8226; any perioperative complications, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:15:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Patricia  Fortin">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome.</P>
<P>Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbS&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.</P>

Populations originating from sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean, Central America, the Middle East, India and parts of the Mediterranean are predominantly affected. Reductions in infant and child mortality and increasing migration from highly affected countries have made this a a worldwide problem (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2012</LINK>). Over 12,500 people in the UK and 100,000 in the USA suffer from the disease (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pleasants-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pleasants 2014</LINK>). A recent study estimated that approximately 305,800 babies were born with SCD in 2010, of which two thirds were born in Africa, and this could increase by 25% to approximately 404,200 by 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The term 'sickle cell disease' refers to all genotypes that cause the clinical syndrome. There are three main types of SCD. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common form of the disease (up to 70% of cases of SCD in people of African origin) and is due to the inheritance of two beta globin S (&#946;S) alleles (haemoglobin (Hb)SS). The second most common genotype (up to 30% of cases in people of African origin) is haemoglobin SC disease (HbSC disease) it is due to the co-inheritance of the &#946;S and &#946;C alleles and tends to be a more moderate form of the disease.The third major type of SCD occurs when &#946;S is inherited with a &#946;-thalassaemia allele, causing HbS/&#946;-thalassaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2010</LINK>). People who have inherited a thalassaemia null mutation (HbSß°) have a disease that is clinically indistinguishable from sickle cell anaemia, whereas people with HbS&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> thalassaemia have a milder disorder. In developed nations, people with SCD are expected to live into their 40s, 50s and beyond, whereas in low-income countries including some African nations it is estimated that between 50% to 90% of children born with HbSS die before their fifth birthday (<LINK REF="REF-Gravitz-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravitz 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grosse-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosse 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In SCD under conditions of low oxygen levels, acidity and cellular dehydration, the HbS molecules polymerise and begin to distort the red blood cells taking on the appearance of sickle-shaped cells. The main determinant of disease severity is the rate and extent of this HbS polymerisation (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2010</LINK>). This is exemplified by co-inheritance of genetic factors that affect the intracellular HbS or foetal haemoglobin concentration, for example the protective effects of co-inherited &#945;-thalassaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Rumaney-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumaney 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2012</LINK>) or hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Akinsheye-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinsheye 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2012</LINK>). Sickling of red blood cells results in two main events: blockage of blood flow resulting in organ and tissue ischaemia; and haemolytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sparkenbaugh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparkenbaugh 2013</LINK>). Both of these processes are thought to lead to increased inflammation and an increased tendency to develop a clot (<LINK REF="REF-Frenette-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frenette 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2010</LINK>). Blockage of blood flow is mediated via a dynamic interaction between sticky HbS containing red cells, the vessel wall, and white cells (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2010</LINK>). Sickle red blood cells also have a shorter lifespan of 10 to 12 days versus 120 days for normal red blood cells due to intravascular and extravascular haemolysis, leading to anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2013</LINK>). Chronic intravascular haemolysis is associated with decreased levels of nitric oxide within the blood, development of pulmonary hypertension and ischaemic strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kato-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood transfusions are a mainstay of treatment in SCD and 90% of adults will have received at least one red blood cell transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2013a</LINK>). Blood transfusion can be given by simple, top-up transfusions to increase the number of normal red blood cells or by exchange transfusion in which the HbS is replaced by healthy red blood cells with a goal of reducing HbS to below 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Kanter-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanter 2013</LINK>). The benefits of transfusion therapy must be balanced against risks including infections, iron overload, alloimmunisation, acute or delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions, and increased complexity of compatibility testing (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chou-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheunemann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheunemann 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ubesie-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ubesie 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Adam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adam 2008</LINK>). In one study the most frequently identified procedures In children include cholecystectomy, followed by tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, splenectomy, umbilical hernia repair and appendectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Hyder-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyder 2013</LINK>). A study in adult surgical procedures in SCD also found cholecystectomy to be the most common procedure followed by splenectomy, hip replacement and obstetric-gynaecological procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Adam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adam 2008</LINK>). A study from the UK in all populations found that ear, nose and throat procedures were the most common, followed by obstetric and gynaecological procedures, hip replacement and cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Buck-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buck 2005</LINK>). In this survey, postoperative complications occurred in 20% of participants. Another study on hip arthroplasty reported a postoperative complication rate of 50% including anaemia due to haemolysis and excessive blood loss (35.7%) as well as infection and vaso-occlusive crisis (21.4%) in those receiving simple transfusions. In those with full exchange transfusions the postoperative complications were seen in 80% of participants with 25% involving acute or delayed haemolytic reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Ould-Amar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ould Amar 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:53:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickled red blood cells increase blood viscosity (resistance to flow) through the intrinsic properties of the sickled cells as well as through abnormal interactions of these cells with white cells, platelets, the vessel wall, and clotting factors. Transfusion of normal donor red blood cells is used to mitigate these effects (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). Blood transfusions are frequently used in preparation for surgery and several regimens are used in current clinical practice. These include 'top-up' transfusion (simple), in which normal red cells are given to decrease anaemia and the concentration of HbS without removal of the individual's blood. In people with SCD who do not have severe anaemia 'top-up' blood transfusions can cause hyperviscosity syndrome because they raise the haemoglobin, but only marginally lower the HbS percentage (<LINK REF="REF-Schmalzer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmalzer 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exchange transfusion involves removing some of the individual's own blood and transfusing allogeneic blood, thereby lowering the concentration of HbS through dilution. This reduces the effects of a given haemoglobin level on blood viscosity. A full exchange transfusion involves a full blood volume exchange by manual or automated apheresis, this allows for rapid lowering of the HbS level to 30% or less, and decreases anaemia. A partial (limited) exchange transfusion refers to manual removal of some of the individual's own blood, this is less effective in lowering the HbS level but is more easily performed when automated exchange is not available. In order to lower the HbS below 30%, repeat partial exchange transfusions may be necessary.</P>
<P>Transfusions can be done either immediately or up to 14 days prior to surgery, although in preparation for elective surgery it is usually undertaken at least 24 hours before the operation to maximise the oxygen transport capacity of the transfused blood. Various practises are used, but with no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases (<LINK REF="REF-Buck-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buck 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-04 12:54:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>People with SCD undergoing surgical procedures have an increased risk for SCD- and non-SCD-associated complications. Transfusions are commonly used to prevent complications such as stroke, vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). As well as the direct and indirect financial cost of red blood cell transfusions, they can adversely affect the individual, causing hyperviscous blood, (precipitating vaso-occlusion), iron overload, alloimmunisation resulting in future complicated compatibility testing, acute or delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions, infections, and longer hospital stays (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). These costs and adverse events are particularly relevant in the developing world where resources and equipment are limited and the infection risks of transfused blood can be higher than in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ansong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansong 2013</LINK>). There is no consensus on the standard of practice for preoperative transfusion with various practises being used. It is important to review the literature to inform and improve standard of practice in this area.</P>

<P>In the Al-Jaouni trial, participants were allocated to receive either preoperative transfusion (simple or partial exchange transfusion) in one hospital versus no preoperative transfusion in the other hospital on alternating days (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>). The length of post-surgery follow up was not reported.

Al-Jaouni enrolled 369 participants over a five-year period (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>). Howard calculated that a sample size of 405 participants would be required to provide 90% power at a 5% significance level to detect a 10% difference in complication rates in either direction (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). The trial was stopped after 70 participants had been recruited due to a higher number of people developing an acute chest syndrome in the no preoperative transfusion arm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>The two RCTs were published in 1995 and 2013 (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>), the quasi-RCT was published in 2006 (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>). One trial was based in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>); one in Saudi Arabia (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>) and one was a multinational trial in 22 centres in Canada, Ireland, Netherlands and the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All trials included individuals with predominantly HbSS disease.The Vichinsky trial only included people with HbSS disease which was confirmed by electrophoresis (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). In the Howard trial two (3%) participants were HbSß°, both were in the preoperative transfusion group (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). In the Al-Jaouni trial 20% of participants were classified as HbSß°, 4% were classified as HbSß<SUP>+</SUP>, and 2% were classified as HbSC (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Al-Jaouni stated that all types of surgical procedures were included except for cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>). In the Howard trial participants were scheduled to undergo low-risk or medium-risk elective surgery under general or regional anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). Those scheduled to undergo high risk surgery such as cardiovascular or brain surgery were excluded. Similarly in the Vichinsky trial, participants were undergoing elective surgery and most surgeries were classed as low or medium risk surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). One surgery in the aggressive transfusion group was classed as high risk.</P>
<P>In the Al-Jaouni trial, the mean age was 16 years old, age ranges from one to 35 years (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>); in the Howard trial, ages ranged from zero to 40 years or older with only 9% of participants in the 40 years or older age group (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>); and in the Vichinsky trial, ages ranged from zero to 20 years or older with approximately 75% of participants in the zero to 19 year age group (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). In both the Howard and Vichinsky trials, participants were equally divided between males and females (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK> ) and in the Al-Jaouni trial, approximately 60% of the participants were female (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Al-Jaouni reported no severity of disease measures or previous complications (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>). Howard reported the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) risk score for mild, moderate, or severe systemic disease with 67% of participants having mild to moderate disease; also, 70% of participants in the no transfusion group and 56% of participants in the preoperative transfusion group had no history of SCD complications (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). In the Vichinsky trial, more participants in the aggressive transfusion group had a history of cardiac disease, smoking or central nervous system disease, although only the latter was statistically significant (P = 0.049) and participants were equally divided in both groups between mild-moderate and severe disease on the ASA risk score (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). Two participants in the aggressive transfusion group and one in the conservative transfusion group were classified as having incapacitating illness that is a constant threat to life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The Al-Jaouni and Howard trials compared no preoperative transfusion to preoperative simple or partial exchange transfusion (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). Transfusions were allowed during surgery to compensate for blood loss.</P>
<P>In the Vichinsky trial, the surgical procedure was randomised into two groups for preoperative transfusion: aggressive, designed to decrease the haemoglobin S level to less than 30% (Group one); and conservative, which was designed to increase the haemoglobin level to 100 g/L (Group two) (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). Blood was from Hb SS negative donors, and participants with a history of allergic reactions to transfusion received leuco-depleted blood. In Group one, 57% of participants received exchange transfusions and 30% had repeated transfusions. In contrast, 77% of participants in Group two received a single transfusion.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Although primary or secondary outcomes were not pre-specified in the Al-Jaouni trial, complications were reported in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Howard trial the primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinically important complications between randomisation and 30 days afterward (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). Clinically important complications were classified as being related to SCD, infection, surgery, or transfusion. Secondary outcomes included the total number of inpatient days, number of red-cell units received during and after surgery; readmission or non-discharge by 30 days after surgery; and a composite outcome of the primary outcome and alloimmunisation at three months after surgery. Limited quality of life data were also collected.</P>
<P>In the Vichinsky trial, the primary outcome was to compare the rates of perioperative complications (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). Complications were recorded and classified as minor (brief temperature elevations and mild wound infections), serious (complications requiring prolonged hospitalisations), or life threatening. Specifically-defined complications included alloimmunisation, painful crisis, acute chest syndrome, neurological events, renal complications and fever or infection. Data regarding transfusion-related complications were also collected. Results were presented as a percentage of each group of operations.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-04 14:02:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>This Cochrane review aimed to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness and safety of preoperative transfusions in people with sickle cell disease (SCD).</P>
<P>We identified three randomised or quasi-randomised trials that met our inclusion criteria containing a total of 990 participants.These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of participants had HbSS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered of low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications.</P>
<P>One randomised trial compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%, usually via an exchange transfusion) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L) (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data from these subsets were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Results for the largest subgroup (cholecystectomy) are reported here as results for both subgroups were similar but the results for the tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries were more imprecise.</P>
<P>The findings of the review led to the following main conclusions regarding an aggressive versus conservative preoperative transfusion regimen.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving a preoperative transfusion regimen to decrease HbS below 30% and decrease anaemia (usually an aggressive regimen), and those that did not. There were no deaths in either subgroup.</LI>
<LI>There was no difference in the number of people developing sickle cell-related complications, a serious infection, any perioperative complications, or transfusion-related complications between people receiving transfusions to lower HbS below 30% and decrease anaemia and those receiving transfusions to increase haemoglobin to 100 g/L to decrease anaemia. This lack of difference between the two outcomes may be due to insufficient evidence to detect a difference due to the small number of participants in the trials.</LI>
<LI>Quality of life was not reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two trials (one randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>) and one quasi-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>)) with 434 participants compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those that did not (there were no deaths in either trial).</LI>
<LI>There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, this may have been due to inherent differences between the populations in the underlying incidence of acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (65 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.80)), whereas the other trial did not (369 participants; RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61)).</LI>
<LI>There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in people receiving preoperative transfusions, this was only seen in the Al-Jaouni trial, there were no events in Howard trial (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>There was no difference in the number of people developing a vaso-occlusive crisis, a serious infection, any perioperative complications, or quality of life between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those that did not. This lack of difference between the two outcomes may be due to insufficient evidence to detect a difference due to the small number of participants in the trials.</LI>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-06 13:02:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>This review provides the most up-to-date assessment of the effectiveness and safety of a preoperative transfusion policy in people with SCD. This 2016 updated review included one additional randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the results of this review should not be interpreted without considering the impact of the following factors.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The trials included in this review range over a 23-year period (1988 to 2011) during which predicted survival rates and supportive care, have changed substantially, and hydroxyurea has been introduced into routine care.</LI>
<LI>The findings in this review can not be generalised to people with HbSC disease or HbS&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> disease. Two trials specifically excluded these individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>), and one trial included only nine people with HbSC disease and 14 people with HbS&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> disease (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Only a subset of data in the Vichinsky trial could be analysed due to unit of analysis issues with re-randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>There are significant differences in the frequency of sickle cell-related complications in people with HbSS disease due to co-inheritance of genetic variants that lead to the persistence of high levels of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) into adulthood. Some people with SCD have exceptionally high levels of HbF. High HbF is associated with generally milder but not asymptomatic disease. Sickle cell anaemia in Saudi Arabia has population concentrations in the Southwestern and Eastern Provinces. Most affected people from the Eastern Province carry the Saudi-Indian -globin gene-like cluster haplotype and have very high levels of HbF. Those from the Southwestern Province have typical African-derived haplotypes and lower HbF levels, albeit at twice the level of comparable haplotype groups of African descent (<LINK REF="REF-Akinsheye-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinsheye 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2012</LINK>). Haemoglobin F levels were not reported in any of the trials.</LI>
<LI>Co-inheritance of alpha thalassaemia may reduce the frequency of complications in people with HbSS (<LINK REF="REF-Rumaney-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumaney 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2012</LINK>). This was not reported in any of the trials.</LI>
<LI>Only five participants within the Howard trial had a haemoglobin level above 90 g/L which necessitated an exchange transfusion to reduce their HbS percentage below 60% (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). Therefore, there are sparse data on the management of people with higher baseline haemoglobins.</LI>
<LI>The majority of participants had intermediate or low risk surgery in all three trials.</LI>
<LI>All of the included trials were conducted in wealthy Western countries. However, developing countries often do not have the resources to support such an extensive preoperative transfusion programme. The potential risks associated with transfusion therapy are increased in such settings due to a lack of trained staff, modern equipment, sanitary conditions and clean, infection-free blood products (<LINK REF="REF-Ansong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansong 2013</LINK>). Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio will be different in developing countries to those in the included trials, and the results discussed in this review may not be generalisable to this setting.</LI>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-04 14:11:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). This was due to two of the trials being at high or unclear risk of bias, and many of the outcome estimates being imprecise.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aggressive versus conservative preoperative transfusion regimen</HEADING>
<P>Five outcomes were considered very low-grade quality evidence according to GRADE methodology due to the serious risk of bias of the included trial, indirectness and the serious imprecision of the estimates. These were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>serious complications related to SCD - acute chest syndrome;</LI>
<LI>serious complications related to SCD - painful crisis;</LI>
<LI>serious infection;</LI>
<LI>perioperative complications (any);</LI>
<LI>transfusion-related complications (any).</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was because of a high risk of performance bias and detection bias due to the nature of the intervention and difficulty blinding participants, physicians and outcome assessors. The reason for indirectness is that we could only report the results in cholecystectomy patients due to unit of analysis issues because of re-randomisation. The reason for the imprecision is because of the small number of participants within the trial and the low number of events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Preoperative transfusion regimen versus no preoperative transfusion regimen</HEADING>
<P>One outcome (perioperative complications (any)) was considered low-grade quality evidence according to GRADE methodology due to the serious risk of bias of the included trial and the serious imprecision of the estimates. This was because of a high risk of performance bias due to the nature of the intervention and difficulty blinding participants and physicians. The reason for the imprecision is because of the small number of participants within the trial and the low number of events.</P>
<P>Two outcomes were considered very low-grade quality evidence according to GRADE methodology due to the very serious risk of bias of the included trials and the serious imprecision of the estimates. These were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>serious complications related to sickle cell disease - painful crisis;</LI>
<LI>serious infection.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was because of a high risk of performance bias and detection bias due to the nature of the intervention and difficulty blinding participants, physicians and outcome assessors; and a high risk of selection bias due to one quasi-randomised trial.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-15 12:10:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>To our knowledge, our review process is free from bias. We conducted a comprehensive search; searching data sources (including multiple databases, and clinical trial registries) to ensure that all relevant trials would be captured. There were no restrictions for the language in which the paper was originally published. The relevance of each paper was carefully assessed and all screening and data extractions were performed in duplicate. We pre-specified all outcomes and subgroups prior to analysis. There were insufficient numbers of included trials within the meta-analyses for us to use a funnel plot to examine the risk of publication bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-06 13:05:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>We know of only one recent systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>), and one evidence-based Expert Panel Report (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>)</P>
<P>The systematic review by Alotaibi included both randomised and non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>). The authors included 10 studies for meta-analyses and identified the same three randomised or quasi-randomised trials identified in this review and included another seven observational studies. They used criteria recommended by the US preventive services task force and the Canadian task force on preventive health care for quality assessment, and rated each trial as good, fair, or poor based on internal validity criteria established a priori. They rated the quality of randomised trials from good (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>) to fair (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>), and all observational studies were rated as poor. They did not use GRADE methodology to create a 'Summary of findings' table and rate the quality of evidence, nor did they follow Cochrane standards for reporting systematic reviews. They included surgical procedures as the unit of analysis in the Vichinsky trial and did not take into account re-randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In accordance with this review, Alotaibi reports a lack of data in individuals with other sickle cell genotypes and in those with HbSC disease (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In accordance with this review, Alotaibi found no difference between aggressive transfusion and conservative transfusion for all-cause mortality, sickle cell-related complications, (analysed as a composite outcome which included acute chest syndrome, painful crisis and neurological complications), or perioperative complications (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>). We found no difference in transfusion-related complications between the conservative and aggressive transfusion groups, whereas in Alotaibi, transfusion-related complications were higher in those treated with an aggressive transfusion (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>). The Alotaibi review included 666 individuals in the analysis but it is not clear how many studies were pooled or if there was any heterogeneity identified (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In accordance with this review, Alotaibi found no difference between preoperative transfusion and no preoperative transfusion for perioperative mortality, transfusion-related complications and postoperative infections (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>). It is not reported how many studies were pooled in these analyses and if there was any heterogeneity identified. They also found no differences in the rate of major surgical complications. There was significant heterogeneity among the three included observational studies and also when pooled with the data from the Howard trial, but no explanation for heterogeneity was provided (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). In contrast to this review, Alotaibi found no differences between preoperative and no preoperative transfusion in sickle cell-related complications, analysed as a composite outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>). The analysis showed significant heterogeneity between randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Jaouni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Jaouni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>), and when both randomised and the two included non-randomised studies were pooled. No explanation for the heterogeneity was provided; however, they did comment that the randomised trials had major quality and power limitations.</P>
<P>Alotaibi also analysed another seven non-randomised studies qualitatively. These were not eligible for meta-analyses and it was reported that preoperative transfusion had a beneficial effect for a reduction in postoperative complications, and a negligible effect in low-risk procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Alotaibi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alotaibi 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 2014 evidence report on the management of SCD by the Expert Panel included randomised trials, non-randomised intervention studies, and observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). For preoperative red blood cell transfusion they included one randomised trial, four observational studies and six case series. It also included a <I>post hoc</I> commentary on the Howard trial and translated the results into a recommendation that red blood cell transfusion should be used in children and adults to increase their Hb levels to 10 g/dL prior to any surgical procedures involving general anaesthesia and rated this as a strong recommendation with moderate quality evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2014</LINK>). No recommendations were made regarding type (aggressive or conservative) of transfusion therapy. They make a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence to consult an SCD expert for guidance as to the appropriate transfusion method for people who have high haemoglobin levels, who are on long-term hydroxyurea therapy or are undergoing high risk surgery. They also make a moderate recommendation with low-quality evidence to consult an SCD expert for those with HbSC or HbSB<SUP>+</SUP> undergoing surgical procedures involving general anaesthesia.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-04 14:18:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-04 14:18:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>It is widely agreed that people with SCD should be warm, well-hydrated and well-oxygenated for surgery in order to avoid conditions that could lead to relative or regional hypoxia, increased sickling and compromised oxygen delivery to tissues.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications. Preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome in people with HbSS who are undergoing moderate risk surgery. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbS&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> disease or those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations, or management of individuals undergoing low-risk surgery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-04 14:18:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Although information from a well-designed prospective randomised controlled trial of preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD is ideal in order to make recommendations for the optimal use of this therapy, there are significant challenges in conducting randomised trials in people with haemoglobinopathies. In the Howard trial, out of 342 people screened only 70 were recruited with reasons for exclusion being decisions by treating clinicians, transfusion within the previous three months, refusal of consent, logistical reasons, low haemoglobin concentration, acute chest syndrome and orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 2013</LINK>). Issues that were not addressed in the included trials includes managing those with low risk surgery, efficacy of a regime of several top-up transfusions over four to six weeks in lieu of exchange transfusions, and the management of people with HBSC or HbS&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> disease.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Changes from previous versions of the review:</HEADING>
<P>Since the protocol for the review was not available we report on changes in this current version of the review from previous versions of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2012</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Objectives</HEADING>
<P>We have added an additional objective. "To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in patients with sickle cell disease." This was implicit in the previous review but not explicitly stated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Types of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>We amalgamated four outcomes for serious complications</P>
<OL>
<LI>Serious complications related to:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>sickle cell disease (e.g. acute chest syndrome, painful crisis, neurological complication, renal complication);</LI>
<LI>surgery (e.g. fall in haemoglobin level);</LI>
<LI>infection;</LI>
<LI>transfusion (e.g. serious transfusion reactions, other serious transfusion complications).</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>We also made some minor rewording changes to the primary outcome of perioperative mortality by adding all-cause, For the secondary outcome for quality of life we added as measured on a validated scale.</P>
<P>
<I>Unit of analysis issues</I>
</P>
<P>Unit of analysis issues were not identified in the previous versions of this review. There were unit of analysis issues with <LINK REF="STD-Vichinsky-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vichinsky 1995</LINK>. We did not report the data in the Vichinsky primary publication on all 551 participants (with 604 procedures), as we could not obtain patient specific data excluding the patients who were re-randomised. We therefore used subsets of the data from two publications reporting on cholecystectomy patients (230 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Haberkern-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haberkern 1997</LINK>) and tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy patients (107 participants) ((<LINK REF="REF-Waldron-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldron 1999</LINK>) where we knew patients could only be randomised once.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We changed from reporting the odds ratio to reporting the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio method for dichotomous outcomes because its interpretation is more familiar to patients and health professionals. Where appropriate, we used the Peto odds ratio when fewer than 5% of participants experienced an outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to build a 'Summary of Findings' table as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low', or 'very low' using the five GRADE considerations. This had not been done in the previous versions of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Characteristics of included studies and risk of bias tables</HEADING>
<P>We added more information on the included trials, and added baseline characteristics of participants and more details on methods and interventions. We also added 'blinding of outcome assessment', 'selective reporting' and 'other bias' to the risk of bias assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Study flow diagram</HEADING>
<P>We created a study flow diagram and based it on guidance adapted from the PRISMA flow diagram and recommended for updates to Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Stovold-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovold 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Aspects of the review that were not implemented due to lack of data</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Publication bias</B>: we did not perform a formal assessment of potential publication bias (small trial bias) because there were fewer than 10 trials within this review (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>: we were unable to group outcome data, with the exception of transfusion-related complications, into those measured during surgery and at three hours, 24 hours, one week and one month after surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>: due to lack of data, two of the three pre-specified sub-group analyses was not performed, these were severity of the disease and age of the patient.</P>
<P>Meta-regression was not performed because no subgroup contained more than 10 trials (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=z1211051241267450100544141048892&amp;versionPK1=z1402131050058761851788035899183&amp;versionPK2=z1501291308432334779879578464591#REF-Deeks-2011">Deeks 2011</A>). Differences between subgroups were commented on as a narrative.</P>
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity between trials due to age of trial or type of transfusion was not performed due to lack of data.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses</B>: we planned to use the random-effects model for sensitivity analyses as part of the exploration of heterogeneity. We could not do sensitivity analyses due to inadequate data.</P>

While it is stated that the participant characteristics of this group were similar in both groups, and that the age range was representative of the whole sample, the fairly limited information of participant or procedure characteristics including at what point in the randomisation that procedures were excluded, and the high exclusion rate, may introduce some attrition bias.</P>
