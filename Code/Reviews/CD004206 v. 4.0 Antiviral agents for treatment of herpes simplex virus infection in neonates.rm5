<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-04 01:04:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The virus herpes simplex (herpes) causes a rare but devastating disease in the newborn that can range from skin and eye infection to shock, organ failure, brain infection, and death. Newborn herpes infection is an uncommon complication of active genital herpes in the mother around the time of delivery or after direct contact with a herpes blister ("fever blister", "cold sore") of an infected caregiver. We reviewed five studies conducted to assess the effects of antiviral agents (medications that reduce the spread of virus in the body) on mortality and long-term complications of herpes disease in the newborn. Antiviral agents were shown to reduce mortality from the condition, but the reduction was not statistically significant due to the small number of infants in the study. There was insufficient trial data to guide caregivers regarding the duration of antiviral therapy or dose.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-11 07:14:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare but serious neonatal pathogen. Prior to the availability of antiviral drugs the mortality associated with all but localised neonatal infection was high, with 85% of infants with disseminated HSV infection and 50% of infants with encephalitis dying by one year of age. The morbidity in the survivors of multiorgan infection was also high, with up to 50% experiencing long-term neurological sequelae.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-03-18 10:28:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effect of antiviral agents in the treatment of neonatal HSV infections on mortality, progression of disease and neurodevelopmental sequelae at approximately one year. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of antiviral agents on major complications associated with the use of these agents including nephrotoxicity and bone marrow suppression.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-03-15 13:10:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2008), MEDLINE (1996 - Nov 2008), EMBASE (1982 - Nov 2008) and reference lists of published trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antiviral therapy in infants less than one month of age with virologically proven HSV infection were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-13 11:57:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were extracted and the analyses performed independently by two review authors. Studies were analysed for methodological quality using the criteria of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. All data were analysed using RevMan 5.1. When possible, meta-analysis was performed to calculate typical relative risk, typical risk difference, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-13 11:58:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two eligible studies of a total of 273 infants were included. Both studies were randomized controlled trials. One study treated 63 infants with vidarabine or placebo (Whitley 1980) and the other study treated 210 infants with aciclovir or vidarabine (Whitley 1991).</P>
<P>In the study comparing vidarabine with placebo (Whitley 1980), infants with all forms of neonatal HSV disease were included [disseminated disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease alone, and skin, eye and mouth (SEM) disease].There was no significant reduction in the risk of mortality when analyzed as an entire group; however, mortality was significantly reduced when data from infants with CNS disease or disseminated disease were combined. There was no difference in the rate of neurological abnormalities in survivors at one year when analyzed as an entire group or by disease category.</P>
<P>There was no difference between aciclovir and vidarabine (Whitley 1991) in preventing mortality from neonatal HSV disease, in preventing disease progression, in reducing the incidence of neurological abnormality at one year, or in the incidence of drug-induced renal or bone marrow toxicity. In infants with SEM disease, there was no significant difference in neurological outcome with aciclovir compared vidarabine treatment. Both drugs were well tolerated in the newborn period.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-03-18 10:29:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient trial evidence to evaluate the effects of antiviral agents with controls or with each other. The rarity of the condition makes effectively powered clinical trials difficult to perform. The efficacy of newer antiviral agents with better bioavailability (e.g. valaciclovir, valganciclovir) for the treatment of neonatal disease needs to be evaluated in randomised trials. The efficacy of oral formulations need to be evaluated as they may be useful for infants with skin, eye or mouth HSV disease or in the treatment of infants with recurrences after the neonatal period.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 12:01:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare but serious neonatal pathogen. The incidence of HSV infection ranges from 1:3,500 to 1:5,000 live births in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan_x002d_Bolyai-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan-Bolyai 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 1999</LINK>), to 1:10-50,000 live births in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Tookey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tookey 1996</LINK>) and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2006</LINK>). Both type 1 and type 2 HSV can cause neonatal disease with the predominant type varying around the world (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2001</LINK>). The majority of infected infants acquire the infection after passage through an infected birth canal, while 5 - 10% are infected postnatally by a caregiver and about 5% are infected <I>in utero </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Whitley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitley 1993</LINK>). Neonatal infection may result in disease localised to the skin, eye or mouth, encephalitis, pneumonitis or disseminated infection (<LINK REF="REF-Whitley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitley 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The highest attack rate for neonatal HSV disease is in offspring of women experiencing their first genital HSV infection who have not seroconverted to HSV prior to the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>). The use of fetal scalp electrodes is an additional risk factor for neonatal HSV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Whitley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitley 1993</LINK>). The diagnosis of neonatal HSV disease is made difficult by the fact that over 70% of women with genital HSV infection are unaware of their condition (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1991</LINK>). Therefore, there is often a significant delay between the onset of symptoms in the infant and the initiation of antiviral therapy.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 12:01:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first drugs that demonstrated efficacy <I>in vivo</I> against HSV were idoxuridine, vidarabine, and trifluridine (<LINK REF="REF-Naesens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naesens 2001</LINK>). Due to toxicity with systemic administration, these drugs were replaced by the nucleoside analogues; first aciclovir and, more recently, ganciclovir, penciclovir, and their respective pro-drugs (inactive precursor of the drugs that are metabolised in the body into the active form)(<LINK REF="REF-Naesens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naesens 2001</LINK>). These agents are converted to monophosphate metabolites by the HSV enzyme thymidine kinase and then to di- and triphosphate products by cellular enzymes that inhibit viral DNA synthesis by a variety of mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Naesens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naesens 2001</LINK>). Of these drugs, only aciclovir and vidarabine have been evaluated in the context of neonatal HSV disease. Prior to the availability of these drugs, the mortality associated with all but localised neonatal infections was very high; 85% of infants with disseminated HSV infection and 50% of infants with encephalitis died by one year of age (<LINK REF="REF-Whitley-1980a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitley 1980a</LINK>). The morbidity in the survivors of multi-organ infection was also high, with up to 50% experiencing long-term sequelae such as seizures, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, visual or hearing impairment and learning difficulties (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>). In the 1980's, the mortality rate from neonatal HSV disease improved with the availability of the intravenous antiviral agents vidarabine and aciclovir, although there was a less dramatic improvement in the morbidity rate (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>). Aciclovir has become the favoured agent over vidarabine as it is more easily administered (<LINK REF="REF-Kimberlin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimberlin 2001</LINK>). In general, these agents are well tolerated in the newborn period aside from reversible neutropenia observed with high doses of aciclovir and the putative risks of nephrotoxicity from both agents (<LINK REF="STD-Kimberlin-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberlin 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recent changes to the therapy of neonatal HSV disease have come about in the form of increased dosing regimens and increased duration of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kimberlin-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberlin 2001a</LINK>) in an attempt to further reduce the death rate and the rate of recurrence. In addition, the availability of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify HSV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood has redefined the natural history of neonatal HSV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Malm-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malm 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1999</LINK>). This technique may have an impact on the classification of neonatal HSV disease in two ways: first, some infants classified clinically as having skin, eye or mouth disease may now have HSV DNA detected in the CSF and be redefined as having central nervous system disease and second, infants with suspected HSV encephalitis without a skin focus from which to culture the virus may now have their condition proven by PCR. The increased use of molecular techniques to diagnose neonatal HSV disease has not been shown to reduce the time to institution of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kimberlin-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberlin 2001a</LINK>) as treatment is usually initiated on an empirical basis because of the high mortality.</P>

<P>We identified five potentially eligible trials assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapy for neonatal HSV disease. Two of these studies met the inclusion criteria: <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>. Both these studies were published as complete articles. A report by Corey and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Corey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corey 1988</LINK>) described a subset of infants enrolled in the randomised control trial that was later reported by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>. This paper reported the outcome of neonatal HSV encephalitis according to HSV serotype and was included in the subgroup analyses of the <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK> study. A report by Sullender (<LINK REF="REF-Sullender-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullender 1987</LINK>) was also on a subset of infants enrolled in the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>. However, this report did not provided additional data for this analysis because it was a descriptive report of neonatal immunity and not a randomized controlled trial.</P>
<P>There were three excluded studies. The study of Skoldenberg (<LINK REF="STD-Skoldenberg-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Skoldenberg 1984</LINK>) was excluded even though it was a randomised controlled trial of antiviral therapy for HSV encephalitis because all patients in the study population were beyond the neonatal period (i.e. greater than four weeks of age). The youngest infants in this study were four months of age. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1983</LINK> described an open label trial of 39 infants less than one month of age with virologically proven HSV that were treated with one of two different doses of vidarabine: 15 mg/kg/day (16 infants) or 30 mg/kg/day (23 infants) both given as a 12 hour infusion for a duration that ranged from one to &gt; 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1983</LINK>). The study was excluded because it was not randomized or quasi-randomized based on current criteria but instead used two consecutive enrolment periods to allocate infants in an open fashion to two different doses. Allocation to different dosing regimens was on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis. Outcome data was combined with infants reported in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>, which had compared vidarabine 15 mg/kg/day for 10 days vs. placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>). There were no randomised controlled trials that compared different doses of aciclovir or different durations of one dose of aciclovir in infants with neonatal HSV disease. Kimberlin described the use of different doses and durations of aciclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV disease (<LINK REF="STD-Kimberlin-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberlin 2001a</LINK>). However, this study was excluded from this review because the study compared two escalated doses of acyclovir (45 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day) with historical controls from the previously reported trial which used a dose of 30mg/kg/day of acyclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The table "Characteristics of Included Studies" contains the details of the included studies. Both studies compared the efficacy of antiviral agents in preventing mortality and morbidity of neonatal HSV disease. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK> was a multicentre trial run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Group (NIAID) in the United States. The study began in 1974 with unstated duration and compared vidarabine with a placebo. The later study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK> was also run through NIAID. This study was conducted from 1981 to 1988 and compared the two antiviral agents, aciclovir with vidarabine. The inclusion criteria and primary and secondary outcome measures were the same for both studies. Newborn infants less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were eligible for enrolment in both studies irrespective of gestational age or co-morbidities. Neonates with signs of HSV disease at birth (i.e. congenital HSV disease) were excluded only in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>. Both studies analysed the mortality and neurological morbidity up to one year of age and analysed these outcomes according to category of neonatal HSV disease : i.e. skin, eye, mouth (SEM), central nervous system disease (CNS) or disseminated infection with or without encephalitis. The two studies had the same definitions for the category of HSV disease. Infants were classified as having disseminated infection if they had multiorgan involvement as shown by elevated hepatic transaminases, pneumonitis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Infants were classified has having CNS disease if they had an abnormal neurological examination or CSF abnormalities such as pleocytosis or elevated CSF protein, with or without skin or eye involvement. Infants were classified as having disease localised to the skin, eye or mouth if they had no evidence of other organ involvement. Hematological, liver and renal abnormalities and adverse clinical events were recorded in both trials, but the laboratory definitions of abnormality were not stated for the laboratory parameters in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK> enrolled 63 neonates with virologically confirmed HSV disease whose disease was diagnosed in the first month of life. No exclusion criteria were specifically listed but it was stated that all infants were enrolled regardless of gestational age, birth weight, and concurrent medical conditions. There were no demographic or clinical differences between the groups. Thirty one infants were randomised to receive intravenous vidarabine at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day over 12 hours at maximum concentration of 0.7 mg/ml for ten days. At entry, four infants in the vidarabine treatment group had SEM disease, ten had CNS disease alone, and 14 had disseminated infection. Thirty two infants were randomised to receive intravenous placebo. In the placebo group, nine infants had SEM disease at study entry, six had CNS disease alone, and 13 had disseminated infection. After enrolment, infants were monitored daily until death or discharge for at least 30 days for evidence of progressive disease (the presence of new lesions, CNS, respiratory, hepatic, or other complications of viral disease) or other concomitant medical conditions or infections. Seven infants were excluded from the efficacy analysis after randomisation. Four infants in the placebo group were given vidarabine because of progressive disease, two infants in the treatment group received a higher dose than stated in the protocol, and one infant in the treatment group received a second course of vidarabine. Outcomes were reported on the remaining 56 infants who were equally divided between the two groups; therefore, analysis was not performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK> enrolled 210 infants with virologically proven neonatal HSV infection. Eight had disease at birth suggestive of intrauterine HSV infection and were excluded from efficacy analysis. Ninety-five infants received vidarabine at 30 mg/kg per day over 12 hours by continuous infusion. One hundred and seven infants received intravenous aciclovir, 30 mg/kg/day divided into three equal doses given eight hours apart. In the aciclovir treated group, there were 54 infants with SEM disease, 35 infants with CNS disease and 18 infants with disseminated infection. In the vidarabine group, there were 31 infants with SEM disease, 36 with CNS disease and 28 with disseminated infection. There were no demographic differences between the groups and the proportion of premature infants was similar in both groups. However, the treatment groups were dissimilar with respect to the category of HSV disease and, therefore, disease severity. Twenty nine percent and 33 percent of infants who received vidarabine had disseminated HSV disease or skin eye mouth disease respectively compared to 17% and 50% of aciclovir-treated infants. Infants were monitored for progression of disease on treatment, mortality, neurodevelopmental morbidity at approximately one year, virologically proven skin recurrences at one and six months after completion of therapy, nephrotoxicity and other adverse reactions. Follow-up was until death or approximately 12 months of age and was complete for mortality but not for neurological sequelae at approximately one year of age (data only reported for 146/167 surviving infants).</P>

<B>Mortality within the first year of life overall, by disease category or by gestational age (Outcomes 1.1 - 1.3):</B>
<BR/>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>, mortality in the first year of life was reported for 56 out of 63 infants randomized to receive either vidarabine or placebo. The mortality for infants was less in infants treated with vidarabine compared with a placebo when all infants were analyzed, with a reduction from 32% to 53% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.32, 1.14) but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The reduction in mortality from vidarabine treatment was greater for infants with disseminated neonatal HSV disease (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.41, 1.12) and for infants with CNS disease alone (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03, 1.51) compared to infants with skin, eye and mouth (SEM) disease (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.03, 13.60) but the confidence intervals were wide and so the differences were not significant when analysed separately. However, the reduction in mortality was significant when data from the infants with disseminated disease or CNS disease was combined (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28, 0.91). Only one infant with SEM disease died in this study and that infant was from the placebo group. In the vidarabine treated group, 14 infants were born at term (greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation) and 14 were preterm (&lt; 37 weeks gestation), whereas in the placebo group, 15 infants were born at term and 13 were born prematurely. No differences were observed in the effect of vidarabine in reducing mortality from neonatal HSV disease when the study population was analysed according to gestational age (term RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.26,1.35; preterm RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.22, 1.71).</P>
<P>
<B>Progression of Disease while on treatment (Outcome 1.4):</B>
<BR/>Information regarding progression of disease was available for this systematic review in 56/63 infants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>. Eight infants in this study were reported to have progression of disease while on treatment, four from the placebo group and four from the vidarabine group. These infants were not included in the final efficacy analyses. Presence or absence of progression of disease on treatment for the remaining 56 enrolled infants was not clearly stated.</P>
<P>
<B>Abnormal neurodevelopment at about one year in total and by disease category at presentation in all enrolled infants (Outcomes 1.5, 1.6):</B>
<BR/>No difference was observed in the number of infants with neurological abnormalities at one year between the 28 vidarabine-treated infants and 28 placebo-treated infants when compared using all enrolled infants as the denominator (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.62, 3.65). Of the 28 infants enrolled in the vidarabine treatment group, 4 had SEM disease at diagnosis, 10 had CNS disease and 14 had disseminated disease. Of the 28 infants enrolled in the placebo group, nine had SEM disease at diagnosis, six had CNS disease and 13 had disseminated disease.

No infants in the treatment or placebo group had demonstrated renal toxicity. Non-significantly fewer infants in the vidarabine-treated group developed leucopenia (RR 0.65 95% CI 0.41, 1.03) or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36, 1.05) compared to the placebo group. No differences between the two groups were observed in the presence or absence of liver function test abnormalities as shown by AST elevation (RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.33, 27.12).

<B>Mortality within the first year of life in total, by disease category or by gestational age (Outcomes 2.1 - 2.2):</B>
<BR/>Comparison of the two antiviral agents aciclovir and vidarabine in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK> revealed no evidence of a difference in preventing mortality in neonates with HSV disease when all categories of disease were included (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41, 1.37). There were no differences between the two drugs noted when mortality was analysed by category of disease. No infants with SEM disease died in this study. No details were provided about mortality according to gestational age in this study.</P>
<P>
<B>Progression of Disease while on treatment (Outcome 2.3):</B>
<BR/>In the study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>, HSV disease progressed on treatment in 12 infants. There was no difference between treatment groups in the development of progression of neonatal HSV disease after initiation of therapy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.30, 2.66).</P>
<P>
<B>Abnormal neurodevelopment at about one year in total and by disease category (Outcome 2.4 - 2.6):</B>
<BR/>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>, the effect of vidarabine and aciclovir on the neurodevelopmental outcome at approximately one year of age was reported for 79 of 98 (81%) surviving aciclovir-treated infants and 67 of 81(83%) surviving vidarabine-treated infants. Neurological sequelae was less in surviving infants who had been treated with aciclovir (25%) compared to surviving infants treated with vidarabine (34%) but the difference did not reach statistical significance when using all enrolled infants as the denominator for each treatment group as a whole (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50, 1.34), when analyzed by disease category or when data from infants with dissseminated or CNS disease were combined. Although a trend to a more favourable neurodevelopmental outcome at one year was present in the aciclovir-treated infants with SEM disease compared to those with the same disease category treated with vidarabine, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.19 95% CI 0.02, 1.76).</P>
<P>
<B>Abnormal neurodevelopment or death in total and by disease category (post-hoc analysis) (Outcome 2.7):</B>
<BR/>We also analysed combined data for death or neurological abnormality at one year to take account for differences in the number of infants who may be evaluated at one year of age due to differences in mortality rate. No difference was noted when the presence of neurological abnormality at one year or death was compared between the two antiviral agents when the group was analysed as a whole (RR 0.79 95% CI 0.57, 1.10) or by disease category (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK>).</P>

The 23 infants were reported by <LINK REF="REF-Corey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corey 1988</LINK> and had been consecutively enrolled at one site; 10 into the aciclovir treatment group, and 13 into the vidarabine treatment group. The infants were analysed for the presence of microcephaly, eye abnormalities, seizures, cerebral palsy, or developmental delay according to HSV serotype at 3 years of age. While the presence of microcephaly, eye abnormalities, seizures, or developmental delay was more common in infants who had neonatal HSV encephalitis caused by HSV-2 compared to HSV-1, no differences were observed according to the type of antiviral agent.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 12:06:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal HSV disease is an uncommon but life-threatening condition with significant morbidity in many of the infants who survive. This systematic review is a summary of the two original trials of antiviral agents to treat neonatal HSV disease that were performed 15 to 20 years ago, as there have been no randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions to treat this disease since that time. The original trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK> of vidarabine vs. placebo for neonatal HSV disease reported a statistically significant reduction in mortality in vidarabine-treated infants with CNS or disseminated disease when the groups were combined compared to those treated with placebo. In this systematic review, the same observation was made, however, when the entire group was analyzed or when these disease categories were analysed individually, the reduction in mortality due to vidarabine did not achieve statistical significance. However, the results of this systematic review need to be interpreted with caution given the small numbers involved and problems in study design of these two trials such as failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis in both studies, and lack of blinding in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK>. Historically, the use of antiviral agents against systemic HSV disease has been temporally associated with improved mortality from this condition, although in the same time period there were also improvements in the intensive care support of the sick neonate and in diagnostic techniques. Confirmation of the clinical efficacy of antiviral agents for neonatal HSV disease is now difficult as it is no longer possible to include a placebo group. A control group was not included in the subsequent trial comparing aciclovir with vidarabine for ethical reasons. Therefore, the protective efficacy of vidarabine displayed in the subsequent trial could not be reconfirmed except by extrapolation to the previous controls from the earlier study.</P>
<P>This review found no evidence of a difference between aciclovir and vidarabine with respect to the prevention of mortality and morbidity from neonatal HSV disease. There were no statistically significant differences between these therapies for either the aforementioned outcomes or for progression of disease when analysed by gestational age, HSV serotype or disease classification. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to small numbers in the subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>The original dose and duration of aciclovir in the study for the treatment of neonatal HSV disease reported by <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1991</LINK> was 30 mg/kg/day of aciclovir given intravenously for 10 days. Early CNS recurrence after the cessation of aciclovir and the finding of long-term neurological deficit in infants originally classified with the non-lethal SEM form of the disease raised concern about persistence of HSV in the CNS at the end of therapy and occult CNS recurrences, respectively. This led to the clinical practice of increased aciclovir dose for this condition (initially 45 mg/kg/day, then 60 mg/kg/day) and for a longer duration of therapy (up to the current practice of 14 days for SEM disease and 21 days for CNS and disseminated infections). It is important to note that these dose escalations are not based on clinical trial results. <LINK REF="REF-Kimberlin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimberlin 2001</LINK> reported a study evaluating the effects of the increased doses and durations of aciclovir; however, this trial could not be included in this review because the subjects reported were not all enrolled in a blinded randomised trial and the investigators used historical controls. In this study, which ran from 1989 to 1997, an earlier calendar year of birth was not associated with increased mortality suggesting but not proving that the improved mortality was more likely due to increased aciclovir dose rather than technological advances in intensive care. The rarity of this condition makes evaluation of small changes in therapy difficult to conduct even by large, multicentre collaborative groups.</P>
<P>This systematic review reflects the fact that research into the treatment of neonatal HSV disease has advanced little over the last two decades. Advances have been made in efforts to reduce vertical transmission of HSV. In a recent systematic review, antiviral prophylaxis given in pregnancy to women with genital herpes have been shown to reduce the incidence of viral shedding at delivery and the rate of Caesarean Section for genital herpes; however, studies were insufficiently powered to determine the effect of this intervention on neonatal HSV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Hollier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollier 2008</LINK>). The use of oral aciclovir prophylaxis in infants that survive neonatal HSV infection to reduce CNS sequelae has also been recently evaluated in a Phase I/II trial. However, there was a high rate of neutropenia in treated infants. There have also been case reports of late CNS recurrences despite the use of oral aciclovir prophylaxis that have raised concerns regarding the efficacy of this therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kimberlin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimberlin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonseca_x002d_Aten-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonseca-Aten 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>The use of systemic antiviral agents to reduce the high morbidity and mortality from neonatal herpes simplex virus disease is an established clinical practice based on the original clinical trial results of <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1980</LINK> that suggested improved mortality in neonates with HSV disease of the CNS or disseminated infection. There is insufficient trial evidence to support a preference for the use of aciclovir or vidarabine or the use of increased dose and duration of aciclovir therapy for this condition.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The efficacy of newer antiviral agents with better bioavailability (e.g. valaciclovir, valganciclovir) for the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus disease needs to be evaluated in randomised trials. However, the rarity of the condition makes effectively powered clinical trials difficult to perform. These agents are available as oral formulations and may be useful for infants with skin, eye and mouth HSV disease, or in the treatment of infants with recurrences after the neonatal period. </P>
