<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Seven new authors (AC, VR, AM, MA, ARN, SMR, AG) conducted the update of the review.</P>
<P>Our conclusions differed from those of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>This updated version includes an extensive revision and update to the text and layout of the review, a 'Risk of bias' assessment according to the last updates of the Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias (including the identification of three key domains for risk of bias assessment), the inclusion of a 'Summary of findings' table and incorporates GRADE.</P>
<P>We adopted the term 'untargeted antifungal treatment' instead of 'antifungal prophylaxis' (used in the original review) to include the following antifungal treatment strategies: prophylaxis, pre-emptive and empiric treatment.</P>
<P>We modified the definition for the outcomes of invasive fungal infection and fungal colonization.</P>
<P>We considered untargeted nonabsorbable antifungal an eligible option for the intervention of our interest, so we changed the name of the comparison to: untargeted treatment with any antifungal drug (systemic or nonabsorbable) compared to placebo/no antifungal/any other antifungal.</P>
<P>We performed additional sensitivity analyses: risk of bias for key domains (all studies versus unclear/high risk), incomplete data outcome (low risk versus unclear/high risk of bias).</P>
<P>We did not perform the subgroup analysis entitled: "Definition of invasive fungal infection conforms to that used in this review" included in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2006a</LINK>). We modified the definition of invasive fungal infection and colonization according to recent evidence leading to discrepancies with definitions provided by most of the studies.</P>
<P>We decided to classify the intervention of the included studies in three classes (prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment, empiric treatment) according to the current classification of antifungal treatment of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 2012</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-01-14 21:32:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving antifungal medications before a definitive diagnosis of fungal infections on mortality from all causes and development of severe infections due to fungi (invasive fungal infections) in adults and children who are critically ill but non-neutropenic, i.e. with a normal number of neutrophils in their blood.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Critically ill adults and children may suffer from invasive fungal infections, such as those affecting the bloodstream and other organs. Once established, such infections are difficult to treat and frequently result in death. Antifungal medications are sometimes given to critically ill adults and children most prone to developing fungal infections and to those with signs of infections when it is still unclear if a fungus is the cause.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (total of 2761 participants). Eleven trials compared the use of fluconazole to placebo or no antifungal treatment. Three trials compared ketoconazole versus placebo. One trial compared anidulafungin with placebo. One trial compared caspofungin to placebo. Two trials compared micafungin to placebo. One trial compared amphotericin B to placebo. Two trials compared nystatin to placebo and one trial compared the effect of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, nystatin and no treatment. The RCTs included participants of both genders with a wide age range and severity of critical illness.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current as of February 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>Funding sources from drug manufacturers were reported in 11 out of 22 studies. Another study was funded by a government agency.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Results of 19 from 22 randomized trials involved 2374 participants and showed that antifungal medications given before definitive diagnosis of fungal infection did not reduce mortality from all causes. None of the studied drugs were associated with a significant reduction of mortality from all causes. However, results from 17 randomized studies involving 2024 participants showed that antifungal drugs significantly reduced the risk of developing invasive fungal infections.</P>
<P>We also reviewed the evidence from five trials (662 participants) about the effect of antifungal treatment on the development of superficial fungal infections but we did not find any significant difference. However, we found evidence from 12 trials (1020 participants) of a significant reduction of fungi in body sites (excluding blood) not causing an infection. Eleven trials (1691 participants) reported serious adverse events requiring cessation of therapy. We found no evidence of differences in serious adverse events requiring interruption of antifungal medications between people who received and those who did not receive them.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for the outcome of mortality (all-cause) was moderate due to limitations in study design. The quality of evidence for the outcome of invasive fungal infection, superficial fungal infection, fungal colonization and adverse events requiring cessation of therapy was low due to limitations in study design, non-optimal total number of patients studied and results inconsistent across studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that the use of antifungal treatment given before definitive diagnosis of fungal infection is not associated with a significant reduction in mortality from all causes among critically ill adults and children with a normal number of neutrophils in the blood. This type of antifungal treatment may be associated with a reduction of invasive fungal infections but the quality of evidence on this point is low.</P>
<P>Further studies with high-quality design are needed to improve the evidence.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-01-15 16:11:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-13 20:42:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Invasive fungal infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Early institution of antifungal therapy is pivotal for mortality reduction. Starting a targeted antifungal therapy after culture positivity and fungi identification requires a long time. Therefore, alternative strategies (globally defined as 'untargeted antifungal treatments') for antifungal therapy institution in patients without proven microbiological evidence of fungal infections have been discussed by international guidelines. This review was originally published in 2006 and updated in 2016. This updated review provides additional evidence for the clinician dealing with suspicion of fungal infection in critically ill, non-neutropenic patients, taking into account recent findings in this field.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-14 15:32:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of untargeted treatment with any antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) compared to placebo or no antifungal or any other antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) in non-neutropenic, critically ill adults and children. We assessed effectiveness in terms of total (all-cause) mortality and incidence of proven invasive fungal infections as primary outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-01-14 15:32:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> We searched the following databases to February 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), and EMBASE (OVID). We also searched reference lists of identified studies and major reviews, abstracts of conference proceedings, scientific meetings and clinical trials registries. We contacted experts in the field, study authors and pharmaceutical companies as part of the search strategy.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-01-13 20:42:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (irrespective of language or publication status) comparing the use of untargeted treatment with any antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) to placebo, no antifungal, or another antifungal agent in non-neutropenic critically ill participants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-01-15 16:11:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Three authors independently applied selection criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion. We synthesized data using the random-effects model and expressed the results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-14 15:32:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 22 studies (total of 2761 participants). Of those 22 studies, 12 were included in the original published review and 10 were newly identified. Eleven trials compared the use of fluconazole to placebo or no antifungal treatment. Three trials compared ketoconazole versus placebo. One trial compared anidulafungin with placebo. One trial compared caspofungin to placebo. Two trials compared micafungin to placebo. One trial compared amphotericin B to placebo. Two trials compared nystatin to placebo and one trial compared the effect of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, nystatin and no treatment. We found two new ongoing studies and four new studies awaiting classification. The RCTs included participants of both genders with wide age range, severity of critical illness and clinical characteristics. Funding sources from pharmaceutical companies were reported in 11 trials and one trial reported funding from a government agency. Most of the studies had an overall unclear risk of bias for key domains of this review (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data). Two studies had a high risk of bias for key domains. Regarding the other domains (blinding of participants and personnel, outcome assessment, selective reporting, other bias), most of the studies had a low or unclear risk but four studies had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There was moderate grade evidence that untargeted antifungal treatment did not significantly reduce or increase total (all-cause) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, P value = 0.36; participants = 2374; studies = 19). With regard to the outcome of proven invasive fungal infection, there was low grade evidence that untargeted antifungal treatment significantly reduced the risk (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83, P value = 0.0001; participants = 2024; studies = 17). The risk of fungal colonization was significantly reduced (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, P value = 0.03; participants = 1030; studies = 12) but the quality of evidence was low. There was no difference in the risk of developing superficial fungal infection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.29, P value = 0.24; participants = 662; studies = 5; low grade of evidence) or in adverse events requiring cessation of treatment between the untargeted treatment group and the other group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.27, P value = 0.51; participants = 1691; studies = 11; low quality of evidence). The quality of evidence for the outcome of total (all-cause) mortality was moderate due to limitations in study design. The quality of evidence for the outcome of invasive fungal infection, superficial fungal infection, fungal colonization and adverse events requiring cessation of therapy was low due to limitations in study design, non-optimal total population size, risk of publication bias, and heterogeneity across studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-13 20:45:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that the use of untargeted antifungal treatment is not associated with a significant reduction in total (all-cause) mortality among critically ill, non-neutropenic adults and children compared to no antifungal treatment or placebo. The untargeted antifungal treatment may be associated with a reduction of invasive fungal infections but the quality of evidence is low, and both the heterogeneity and risk of publication bias is high.</P>
<P>Further high-quality RCTs are needed to improve the strength of the evidence, especially for more recent and less studied drugs (e.g. echinocandins). Future trials should adopt standardized definitions for microbiological outcomes (e.g. invasive fungal infection, colonization) to reduce heterogeneity. Emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs should be considered as outcome in studies investigating the effects of untargeted antifungal treatment to balance risks and benefit.</P>

<P>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a well-documented complication of critically ill patients.

Moreover, IFIs impose an important economic burden mainly due to prolonged ICU stay, cost of antifungal drugs and overall use of hospital resources (<LINK REF="REF-Dodds-Ashley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodds Ashley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rentz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rentz 1998</LINK>). Bloodstream infection (BSI) due to <I>Candida spp</I>. (candidaemia) is considered the most common IFI in critically ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bassetti-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassetti 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kett 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kullberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kullberg 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2009</LINK>). In specific subgroups of patients (e.g. abdominal surgical patients), other forms of IFIs are also frequent (e.g. intra-abdominal candidiasis), alone or in combination with candidaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Bassetti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassetti 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bassetti-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassetti 2015</LINK>). Among fungal pathogens, <I>Candida spp</I>. are the most commonly isolated microorganisms, currently ranking the fourth most commonly identified pathogens in nosocomial BSIs and the third most common pathogens isolated in ICU patients (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wisplinghoff--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisplinghoff 2004</LINK>).

<P>The administration of an antifungal drug after the definitive microbiological proof of fungal infection constitutes what has been defined as targeted antifungal therapy. Due to the long turnaround time for culture results with late microbiological documentation in the course of infections (<LINK REF="REF-Bassetti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassetti 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cuenca_x002d_Estrella-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuenca-Estrella 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2011</LINK>), and the increasing mortality associated with a delay in therapy institution (<LINK REF="REF-Garey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garey 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kollef-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollef 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Morrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puig_x002d_Asensio-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puig-Asensio 2014b</LINK>), different antifungal strategies have been studied for preventing IFI in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. The administration of any antifungal drug prior to the definitive microbiological evidence of fungal infection constitutes an untargeted antifungal treatment . Recently, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) provided the definitions of three different treatment strategies, classifying them into prophylactic, pre-emptive and empiric treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 2012</LINK>). Prophylaxis has been defined as the administration of antifungal agents in patients without proven or suspected fungal infection (i.e. absence of microbiological or radiological evidence) but with risk factors for its development (e.g. patients treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, presence of a central venous catheter, under parenteral nutrition or who underwent major abdominal surgery). Pre-emptive treatment (<I>diagnosis-driven approach</I>) has been defined as treatment triggered by microbiological evidence of fungal infection, without definitive microbiological proof. Surrogate biomarkers for the presence of fungal infection (e.g. 1-3 ß-D-glucan, mannan/anti-mannan antibody) have been investigated for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Mikulska-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikulska 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Posteraro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posteraro 2011</LINK>). Empiric treatment (<I>fever-driven approach</I>) has been defined as the antifungal treatment triggered by signs and symptoms of infection in patients at risk for IFI, in the absence of microbiological evidence of infection at the moment of therapy institution.</P>

<P>A prompt effective antifungal treatment is one of the most important determinants for mortality reduction in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock due to fungal infections. Unfortunately, despite advances in microbiological techniques, the proven diagnosis of fungal infections requires several days and usually occurs late (<LINK REF="REF-Bassetti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassetti 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cuenca_x002d_Estrella-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuenca-Estrella 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2011</LINK>). The advantage of antifungal treatment given before definitive microbiological diagnosis has been established in high-risk patients such as cancer patients and solid organ transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Cruciani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruciani 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marino-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marino 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Playford-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2004a</LINK>). In these populations, the use of antifungal agents has been proven to be effective for IFI reduction. However, in non-neutropenic critically ill patients, several antifungal strategies have been investigated among different selected populations (e.g. surgical or nonsurgical patients). In non-neutropenic critically ill patients, the definitive evidence for the effect on mortality and IFIs by untargeted treatment has not been established to date. Potential detrimental effects of the extensive use of antifungal agents are the emergence of <I>Candida</I> <I>spp</I>. with reduced susceptibility to drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Fekkar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fekkar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfaller--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfaller 2012</LINK>), drug-induced side effects and an increase of financial costs (<LINK REF="REF-Lortholary-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lortholary 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-13 20:55:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antifungal drugs given to critically ill patients before definitive microbiological proof of IFIs may have a positive impact on patients' outcome given the high morbidity and mortality, especially in case of inadequate and late antifungal treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Garey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garey 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kollef-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollef 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puig_x002d_Asensio-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puig-Asensio 2014b</LINK>). The original review aimed to determine the benefits and harms of the prophylactic administration of antifungals in non-neutropenic, critically ill patients. That review incorporated the existing evidence up to 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2006a</LINK>). During these last 10 years, the administration of antifungal drugs for prevention of fungal infections has been further investigated, additional antifungal treatments have been introduced for this purpose and the role of colonization for subsequent development of fungal infection has been better clarified (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pittet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vardakas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardakas 2009</LINK>). This updated version was conducted to determine the current state of the evidence in this regard. Recently, different approaches for fungal infection prevention and treatment have been better defined and standardized by international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 2012</LINK>). In the original review, authors used "antifungal prophylaxis" as a definition for the intervention encompassing the terms prophylaxis, pre-emptive and empiric treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2006a</LINK>). In order to avoid confusion and considering the new definitions, in this updated version we decided to use the term "untargeted treatment" to identify the use of any antifungal agent given prior to the definitive microbiological diagnosis. "Un-targeted treatment" encompasses the terms prophylaxis, pre-emptive and empiric treatments. Recent evidence reconsidered the role of <I>Candida spp</I>. detection from respiratory tract specimens (<LINK REF="REF-Meerssemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meerssemann 2009</LINK>), leading to the suggestion by international guidelines of considering this event a colonization rather than invasive infection (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 2012</LINK>). Consequently, we modified the definition of a primary outcome (invasive fungal infection), excluding those events involving the respiratory tract. In older studies, azole antifungals (e.g. fluconazole, ketoconazole) were more commonly used for this purpose. Recently, another class of antifungal agents, namely echinocandins (e.g. anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin) have been introduced for both targeted and untargeted treatment use in a broad spectrum of clinical conditions including critically ill, non-neutropenic patients. Moreover, since <I>Candida</I> colonization has been identified as a risk factor for subsequent IFI (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pittet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vardakas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardakas 2009</LINK>), nonabsorbable antifungal drugs (e.g. nystatin) have been studied for its prevention. For this reason, we studied these types of antifungal drugs as part of the intervention of interest for this updated review.</P>

The GRADE approach considers &#8216;quality&#8217; to be a judgement of the extent to which we can be confident that the estimates of effect are correct (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Evidence from randomized controlled studies initially was graded as high and was downgraded by one for serious (or by two for very serious) limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. We selected the following outcomes for the 'Summary of findings' table:</P>

<P>We identified a total of 3725 records from both databases and other sources (3687 through databases search and 38 from other sources). After we removed duplicates, 3281 records were screened from title and abstract. We excluded articles at the title and abstract stage (3230) included studies with a non-randomized design, with other than untargeted antifungal treatment or studies including an ineligible population. We examined 51 records further for eligibility from full-texts (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Of these, we excluded a total of 18 articles (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The reasons for exclusion were as follows: not randomized design (two studies), ineligible population (three studies), ineligible interventions (10 studies), outcomes not relevant (one study), results not available after contacting investigators and sponsors (two studies). We included 22 studies in the qualitative analysis (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Among them, 12 studies were already included in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2006a</LINK>), and 10 were additionally included in this update. Eleven trials compared the use of fluconazole to placebo or no antifungal treatment. Three trials compared ketoconazole versus placebo. One trial compared anidulafungin with placebo. One trial compared caspofungin to placebo. Two trials compared micafungin to placebo. One trial compared amphotericin B to placebo. Two trials compared nystatin to placebo and one trial compared the effect of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, nystatin and no treatment.</P>

Furthermore, participants were required to have an anticipated length of ICU stay of more than 48 hours and at least one manifest risk factor within 48 hours of ICU admission (central venous catheter placement, administration of total parenteral nutrition, artificial ventilation for more than 24 hours, or treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics). Baseline characteristics reported in the analysis included mean age (46 in the treatment group, 42 in the placebo group), sex (82 men and 37 women) and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (18 in both groups). Participants were randomized to receive either fluconazole (800 mg initially followed by 400 mg daily intravenously, orally, or enterally) or placebo (given by same route of administration) for the duration of ICU stay. This study was supported by an investigator-initiated grant from Roerig/Pfizer.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Albert-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 2014</LINK> included 61 adult people admitted to five ICUs in Canada for at least 96 hours who developed a clinically suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Participants were included if a respiratory tract secretion culture was positive for <I>Candida</I> <I>spp</I>. Respiratory tract specimens were collected within 24 hours of suspicion of infection. Baseline characteristics reported in the analysis included mean age (57.6 in the intervention group, 63 years in the placebo group), sex (44 men and 16 women) mean APACHE II score (22.9 in the treatment group, 23 in the placebo group), mean sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) score (3.8 in both groups). Participants were randomized to receive either anidulafungin (200 mg intravenously, followed by 100 mg daily for at least 72 hours) or matching placebo. When <I>Candida</I> <I>spp</I>. were sensitive to fluconazole, participants were de-escalated to fluconazole or matching placebo. Participants were treated for a total of 14 days. The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty in recruiting participants and diminishing study resources.

<P>The ARDS Network trial included 234 people aged at least 18 years admitted to 24 ICUs in the United States, who were ventilated and who developed acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from direct and indirect lung injury (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). Reported baseline characteristics included mean age (55 in the treatment group, 52 in the placebo group), sex (140 men and 94 women), mean APACHE III score (81.6 in the treatment group, 81 in the placebo group). Participants were randomized to receive either ketoconazole (400 mg daily enterally) or placebo for 21 days or until more than 48 hours of unassisted ventilation was achieved. This study tested the efficacy of ketoconazole in reducing mortality and morbidity in people with ARDS based on its anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, this study did not test the direct antifungal activity of ketoconazole.

<LINK REF="STD-NCT00048750" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00048750</LINK>. In this phase three unpublished trial, investigators included 103 people at least 16 years of age. Twenty-one ICUs in the United States and Canada participated in this study. Participants were included if they had a predicted ICU stay of at least 72 hours and were judged to be at a high risk of developing IFIs based on risk factors (usage of systemic antibiotics, use of total parenteral nutrition, renal failure, fungal colonization). Participants' reported baseline characteristics included mean age (52.8 years in the treatment group and 59.9 in the placebo group), sex (61 men and 41 women), mean APACHE II score (16.4 in treatment group and 19.1 in the placebo group), and mean Marshall score (5.7 in the treatment group and 6.3 in the placebo group) (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1995</LINK>). Participants were randomized to receive either micafungin (100 mg daily intravenously) or placebo until ICU discharge. The study was discontinued because the sponsor (Astellas Pharma) concluded that many truly high risk participants were receiving antifungal prophylaxis off-study and consequently they were not enrolled into the study. It was judged that a reversal of this trend was unlikely and that a low incidence of fungal events would continue.</P>

In one study, a randomization table was used (<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1990</LINK>); and in another study a random number generator was adopted (<LINK REF="STD-Sandven-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sandven 2002</LINK>). According to the information provided, these trials were judged to have a low risk of bias due to inadequate randomization. In eight studies a description of both method and type of the randomization was partially missing (<LINK REF="STD-Eggimann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eggimann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garbino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Garbino 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giglio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Giglio 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00048750" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00048750</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Namikawa-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Namikawa 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ostrosky_x002d_Zeichner-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ostrosky-Zeichner 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pelz 2001</LINK>).

In one study, participants received the intervention on admission to ICU although the inclusion criteria stated the need for at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation for inclusion; thus, there seems to be unclear relationships between inclusion, randomization, allocation concealment and timing of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Beshey-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Beshey 2014</LINK>). In one study a sample size of 600 participants was originally planned; however, after a data review, a low incidence of fungal endpoints was observed due to a low recruitment rate (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00048750" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00048750</LINK>). This was attributed to the off-study administration of antifungals to truly high risk participants in the participating centres and the study was terminated. After consensus, we decided to consider this study at high risk of other bias for this reason. In another study, participants with altered liver function were not allocated in one treatment group (ketoconazole) leading to a potential unbalanced allocation of most critically ill people (<LINK REF="STD-Savino-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Savino 1994</LINK>).</P>

In the intervention group, 145 participants developed a fungal colonization in comparison to 204 participants in the other group. The RR of developing fungal colonization if allocated to the untargeted treatment group was 0.71 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.97; P value = 0.03). The quality of evidence was rated as low as all studies that contributed to this result had an unclear risk of bias and a downgrading was applied. Moreover, we observed a significant statistical heterogeneity across studies (I² statistic = 78%) possibly linked to a clinical heterogeneity that could be explained by the adoption of different criteria for detection of colonization (e.g. different numbers of sites or different locations of sites (or both) analysed for fungal cultures). We applied a further downgrading for this reason.</P>

<P>The effect estimates for main outcomes are detailed in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We found moderate quality evidence from 19 studies (2374 participants) that the use of untargeted antifungal treatment in non-neutropenic critically ill patients was not associated with significant survival benefits since it did not significantly reduce or increase total (all-cause) mortality. Evidence from 17 studies in 2014 people showed that untargeted antifungal treatment may significantly reduce the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. We found low-quality evidence that untargeted antifungal treatment may significantly reduce fungal colonization whereas it did not significantly reduce the incidence of superficial fungal infections. Moreover, we found low quality evidence, from 11 studies, supporting that there is no increase in the risk of adverse events requiring cessation of antifungal treatment. Evidence from included studies showed that the use of untargeted antifungal treatment did not significantly reduce or increase the incidence of IFIs by azole-resistant <I>Candida</I> species, fungal colonization by azole-resistant <I>Candida</I> species and suspected IFIs. The use of untargeted antifungal treatment did not significantly reduce the incidence of proven or suspected IFIs.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-14 21:48:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review need to be interpreted in light of the following considerations. Firstly, there is a lack of eligible high-quality randomized controlled trials addressing our outcomes of interest. Only two trials were judged to have an overall low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuster-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 2008</LINK>). Secondly, the overall effect of untargeted antifungal treatment came from studies investigating the use of different antifungal drugs covering a wide period of research. The effect of an untargeted antifungal treatment may be influenced by the type of drug used, due to fungal microbiological epidemiology and patterns of resistance to antimicrobials in different ICUs and hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Kett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kett 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfaller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfaller 2011</LINK>). There was a predominence of studies investigating the use of fluconazole (and azoles in general). Other drugs were tested in few studies. The subgroup analyses, investigating the effects of azoles, echinocandins, systemic and nonabsorbable drugs separately, aimed to deal with this issue (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>). On the other hand, the participants included in this review seem to be representative of the general population of non-neutropenic critically ill people, due to the relatively high number of participants for both primary outcomes, different clinical characteristics and severity of illness, and the wide range of geographic locations of enrolling centres.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-01-14 21:11:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence contributing to the main outcomes is described in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The overall quality of evidence contributing to the effect estimate for mortality was considered of moderate grade since most studies that contributed to this outcome had an unclear risk of bias and the quality of evidence was downgraded for this reason. For the outcome of proven IFI, the quality of evidence was rated low due to the unclear risk of bias of the contributing studies and the potential for publication bias detected through the observation of asymmetry of the funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). A low quality of evidence was also attributed to the outcome of superficial fungal infection, since all five studies contributing to this result had an unclear risk of bias and downgrading was applied (<LINK REF="STD-Ables-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ables 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garbino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Garbino 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Namikawa-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Namikawa 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pelz 2001</LINK>). Moreover, the total number of participants and events from studies contributing to the outcome of superficial fungal infection was less than the number which would be generated for the calculation of the optimal information size: a further downgrading was applied for this reason. For the outcome of fungal colonization, the quality of evidence was rated as low as all studies that contributed to this result had an unclear risk of bias: a downgrading was applied. Moreover, a significant statistical heterogeneity across studies was observed. A clinical heterogeneity across studies investigating the outcome of fungal colonization may be explained by the adoption of different criteria for detection of colonization (e.g. different numbers of sites or different locations of sites (or both) analysed for fungal cultures); we applied a further downgrading for this reason. Regarding the outcome of adverse events requiring cessation of study drug, the overall quality of evidence was low. We downgraded by one level for the unclear risk of bias of most studies contributing to this outcome. We further downgraded by another level due to the low number of total participants and events compared to the optimal information size.</P>

We searched clinical trial registries from which we retrieved eligible studies with partial missing data (e.g. part of results and participants characteristics) (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00048750" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00048750</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01122368" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01122368</LINK>). A reconsideration of these studies should be taken into account in light of their possible future peer-reviewed publication. As part of our search strategy, we contacted study authors, sponsors and pharmaceutical companies of studies reported as ongoing, or completed, but without published results. Moreover, we tried to obtain further information from authors of already published studies in cases of doubt about data. However, on some occasions we had incomplete correspondence. We also had incomplete correspondence regarding the studies awaiting classification (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havlicek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Havlicek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milesi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Milesi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2005</LINK>). In two studies we could not ascertain the proportion of included patients with neutropenia even though results were available (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havlicek-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Havlicek 2008</LINK>). We decided not to include these studies in order to avoid potential bias in the review process. In the other two studies we could not obtain necessary further information and results (<LINK REF="STD-Milesi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Milesi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some studies reporting fungal colonization, the outcome did not fit our definition (e.g. studies reporting number of colonized sites by fungi per participants or colonization index). Where possible, we obtained data suitable for our analysis from study authors upon request. However, when the number of participants with at least one colonized site was not available (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>), this outcome was not considered for the quantitative analysis.</P>
<P>For each included study, we provided a definition for the type of untargeted antifungal treatment used (i.e. prophylactic, pre-emptive, empiric treatment) according to international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 2012</LINK>). However, due to incomplete description of participants' characteristics and settings, this definition attribution was not always straightforward. It may be argued that the intervention studied in this review (untargeted antifungal treatment) encompassed three different treatment strategies possibly leading to heterogeneity. However, it should be considered that all three different antifungal strategies are used before the definitive proof of fungal infections and that is the reason why they are studied as a single intervention in both the original and updated review (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2006a</LINK>). These aspects should be considered by the reader when considering the results of the subgroup analysis according to the type of treatment.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-14 15:30:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several systematic reviews studied the use of antifungal treatment for prevention of IFIs (<LINK REF="REF-Cruciani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruciani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shorr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorr 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vardakas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardakas 2006</LINK>). They all included critically ill surgical participants and most of their evidence was based on the use of azoles for prophylaxis. They showed a significant reduction of IFIs rate with an associated reduction of mortality risk observed only in one meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Cruciani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruciani 2005</LINK>). Of note, the results for IFIs were similar to that observed in subgroup analysis for azoles (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>). However, our update encompasses a wider range of participants' characteristics (e.g. both medical and surgical critically ill participants) and this should be considered when these results are compared with those from our review. To our knowledge, there are no more recent systematic reviews investigating the use of azoles, echinocandins, nonabsorbable antifungal drugs as untargeted antifungal treatment in non-neutropenic adult critically ill patients. Systematic reviews on antifungal agents for prevention of fungal infections were conducted in many other settings including: low-birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Austin-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2013b</LINK>), children (<LINK REF="REF-Blyth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blyth 2010</LINK>), people affected by cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Robenshtok-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robenshtok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2014</LINK>), solid organ transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Cruciani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruciani 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marino-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marino 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Playford-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2004a</LINK>). In low-birth weight infants and children the use of antifungal prophylaxis was not associated with a mortality reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Austin-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blyth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blyth 2010</LINK>), whereas a reduction of IFIs was described (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Austin-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2013b</LINK>). In people with cancer or who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, a mortality reduction was observed with antifungal prophylaxis or empiric treatment (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robenshtok-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robenshtok 2007</LINK>). A reduction of IFIs in people with cancer was observed after the use of amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole but not with the use of ketoconazole or miconazole (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2014</LINK>). In people who underwent liver transplantation, a reduction of IFI, but not of mortality was reported after antifungal prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Cruciani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruciani 2006</LINK>). Due to the different settings and people's characteristics, a comparison of these results with those from this update is not feasible.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-13 22:09:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, in critically ill, non-neutropenic patients, there is moderate-quality evidence that un-targeted treatment with any antifungal drug does not significantly increase or reduce total (all-cause) mortality. There is low-grade evidence supporting the use of untargeted antifungal treatment for prevention of invasive fungal infection. The reduction of invasive fungal infections is observed when fluconazole and caspofungin are used as antifungal medication. Low-quality evidence supports the efficacy of the intervention for fungal colonization reduction. The use of untargeted antifungal drugs does not seem to be associated with an increase of superficial fungal infections and adverse events requiring cessation of treatment with low quality of evidence for both outcomes. The clinical decision of starting an untargeted antifungal treatment in non-neutropenic critically ill patients should consider patients' characteristics, type of drugs available and feasible type of antifungal strategy (i.e. prophylactic, pre-emptive and empiric).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-13 22:09:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence provided by this updated review on the effect of untargeted antifungal treatment is not conclusive. Further research may be justified focusing on which specific untargeted antifungal treatment among prophylactic, pre-emptive and empiric is most beneficial in non-neutropenic, critically ill patients. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials should be done to investigate the use of drugs less studied in this setting to date. Two ongoing trials are addressing some of these issues, giving more evidence in the next future (<LINK REF="STD-Lass_x002d_Fl_x00f6_rl-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lass-Flörl 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Timsit-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Timsit 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future trials should adopt standardized definitions of microbiological outcomes (e.g. invasive fungal infection, fungal colonization) to reduce heterogeneity. Moreover, they should consider the emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs, especially with the use of recently introduced compounds (e.g. echinocandins), to balance risks and benefit of untargeted antifungal treatment .</P>

<P>Comment: The authors excluded patients who died or were discharged within the 15-day period of intervention. The study did not report the number of these patients and the events that possibly occurred to them. Even though the primary outcome of this study is the effect of treatment in terms of reduction of severity score, colonization and infections during the study period, the missing data from patients excluded for this reason could be a potential source of bias. According to the study protocol, it was clear that these patients had been excluded retrospectively (after randomization and either discharge or death within 15 days)</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote: &#8220;Six hundred male and female patients were planned to be enrolled in the study. Due to the low incidence of fungal endpoints observed at the time of an initial blinded data review, a survey on patient entry was conducted and an investigators&#8217; meeting was held. At that time the sponsor concluded that many truly high risk patients were receiving anti-fungal prophylaxis off study and consequently not being enrolled into the study. It was judged that a reversal of this trend was unlikely and that a low incidence of fungal events would continue. Therefore, the study was discontinued&#8221;</P>

<P>Why was the <LINK REF="STD-De-Jonge-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Jonge 2003</LINK> study excluded? The text says the intervention was not eligible but it included topical / non-absorbable amphotericin B (in combination with other interventions, as per "types of study" described in the methods section).</P>
<P>Surely many of the Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) trials (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2009</LINK>) would be potentially eligible for inclusion as they contain antifungal prophylactic treatment in critically ill patients?</P>

<P>The authors clarification in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> "<I>The study groups were required to differ only for the antifungal regimen under investigation; other co-interventions and aspects of care, including the routine use of other antimicrobial agents, were required to be the same to avoid potentially confounded comparisons.</I>" clarifies why SDD trial were not included.</P>
<P>However, I would suggest that this contradicts the wording of the <LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK> included "<I>We considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of any antifungal agent (either systemic or nonabsorbable;<B>
<U>alone or in combination with other interventions</U>
</B>) given as untargeted treatment in non-neutropenic critically ill adults and children." </I>This suggests that other co-interventions (i.e. SDD trials) would be eligible, hence the confusion. Maybe this wording could be altered to improve clarity?</P>

<P>Thank you for your query. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the use of any antifungal drugs either absorbable or non absorbable to no antifungal, placebo or any other antifungal drug. Moreover, we specified in the methods section (<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>): "The study groups were required to differ only for the antifungal regimen under investigation; other co-interventions and aspects of care, including the routine use of other antimicrobial agents, were required to be the same to avoid potentially confounded comparisons.". We excluded <LINK REF="STD-De-Jonge-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Jonge 2003</LINK> because the two groups (SDD versus control or standard of care) differed not only for the antifungal drugs administered.<BR/>We considered for inclusion RCTs investigating SDD if the intervention arm and the control arm differed only for the administration of<BR/>antifungal drugs. Notably, we included <LINK REF="STD-Beshey-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Beshey 2014</LINK> in the qualitative analysis for this reason. We excluded trials investigating SDD regimens, even if including antifungal drugs, if co-interventions were different between study groups as in <LINK REF="STD-De-Jonge-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Jonge 2003</LINK>

<P>Thank you for your feedback on this review. We have been in correspondence with the review author who has agreed to make the following recommended change and this will appear shortly along with your feedback. </P>
<P>&#8216;<LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK>&#8217; now reads: "We considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of any antifungal agent given as untargeted treatment in non-neutropenic critically ill adults and children."</P>
<P>We removed the section previously in parenthesis (either systemic or nonabsorbable; alone or in combination with other interventions). The </P>
<P>explanation in parenthesis was unnecessary because the full clarification is in &#8216;<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>&#8217;. I hope this addresses your feedback.</P>
