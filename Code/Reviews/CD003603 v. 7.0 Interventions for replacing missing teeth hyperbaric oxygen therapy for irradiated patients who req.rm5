<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:10:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was produced to compare the success of dental implant treatment carried out with and without hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in patients who had previously had radiation treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Missing teeth can affect eating and speaking as well as appearance. Dental implants offer one way to replace missing teeth. Patients who have undergone radiotherapy and those who have also undergone surgery for cancer in the head and neck region may particularly benefit from reconstruction with implants. Dental implants into the bone of the jaw offer support for replacement teeth, and sometimes for replacements for parts of the mouth (prosthetics) that have been removed following surgery for cancer or as a result of damage to the bone (osteonecrosis) caused by radiation treatment.</P>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (which requires patients to breath pure oxygen under pressure in a specially designed chamber on several occasions) has been advocated to improve the success of implant treatment. It has been suggested that HBO therapy will improve the healing of the bone and tissues around dental implants in patients who have undergone radiotherapy, but this remains a controversial issue.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was up-to-date as of 1 July 2013. One small study carried out at a head and neck cancer clinic based at a university in the Netherlands was found. The study included 26 adults who had been treated for head and neck cancer either with radiotherapy or a combination of radiotherapy and surgery. All participants were missing all their teeth in the lower jaw and were experienced problems retaining a denture. The participants were split into two groups, 13 of them were treated with HBO and the other 13 were not.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Only one small trial that was at high risk of bias compared treatment with HBO with treatment without HBO. The results failed to determine a benefit for HBO therapy in preventing failure of dental implants or other serious complications such as the death of bone in the jaw caused by radiotherapy treatment. More reliable studies are needed to provide the final answer to this question.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was very low as it was based on one small trial at high risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:00:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 17 June 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 June 2013). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for studies outside the searched journals. We wrote to authors of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and to more than 55 oral implant manufacturers; we used personal contacts and we made a request on an internet discussion group in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:01:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were analysed using random-effects models to determine mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:08:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one RCT, providing very low quality evidence, was identified and included. Thirteen patients received HBO therapy while another 13 did not. Two to six implants were placed in people with fully edentulous mandibles to be rehabilitated with bar-retained overdentures. One year after implant loading, four patients had died from each group. One patient, treated with HBO, developed an osteoradionecrosis and lost all implants so the prosthesis could not be provided. Five patients in the HBO group had at least one implant failure versus two in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures, postoperative complications and patient satisfaction between the two groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-06-12 14:39:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the limited amount of clinical research available, it appears that HBO therapy in irradiated patients requiring dental implants may not offer any appreciable clinical benefits. There is a definite need for more RCTs to ascertain the effectiveness of HBO in irradiated patients requiring dental implants. These trials ought to be of a high quality and reported as recommended by the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>). Each clinical centre may have limited numbers of patients and it is likely that trials will need to be multicentred.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:49:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with dentures or bridges, permitting restoration of masticatory function, speech and aesthetics. Since the 1970s dental implant supported prostheses have offered an alternative. Dental implants are surgically inserted into the jaw bone and are retained due to the intimacy of bone growth onto their surface, termed osseointegration (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>). Osseointegrated dental implants have undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 40 years.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:11:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Teeth are lost due to dental diseases or trauma, or may be congenitally absent. In addition, there are some patients who have lost extensive oral and facial tissues following surgery for cancer. Reconstruction of these tissues can be difficult but implant therapy offers an improvement to previous treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Franzen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franzen 1995</LINK>). Some cancer patients have undergone radiotherapy as an adjunct to surgery whereas others have only had radiotherapy treatment. Complications of radiotherapy treatment include oral mucosal damage (mucositis), dry mouth (xerostomia) as a result of salivary gland damage, and damage to bone (osteoradionecrosis). Osteoradionecrosis is the most serious complication as it is difficult to treat and may require partial jaw resection. It commonly affects the mandible although it may also affect other bones (sternum, skull, pelvis). Any surgical treatment involving the jaws that follows radiotherapy may show compromised healing or even lead to osteonecrosis, hence dental implant treatment for such patients has been considered as a relative contraindication. Conversely, implant therapy is of significant benefit to this group of patients who can have trouble wearing dentures due to a dry mouth and since ulcerations of the oral mucosa below the dentures are common and impair their eating capacity and may lead to serious infections or osteonecrosis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:11:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy gained strong support, for positive effects on compromised tissue following irradiation, after its introduction in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1984</LINK>). HBO therapy consists of exposing a patient in a special chamber to intermittent, short term 100% oxygen inhalation at a pressure greater than one atmosphere. A typical protocol developed for osteoradionecrosis is the Marx-University of Miami protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1984</LINK>), which requires a patient to receive 20 HBO treatments of 100% oxygen at 2.4 atmospheres for 90 minutes before surgery, followed by a further 10 HBO treatments of 100% oxygen at 2.4 atmospheres for 90 minutes after surgery.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 16:18:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been proposed that HBO therapy may improve osseointegration of implants (<LINK REF="REF-Granstr_x00f6_m-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granström 1992</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The question as to whether HBO therapy affects implant success in irradiated patients is important because HBO therapy is not without risk of adverse effects. HBO therapy is time consuming, expensive, and requires significant patient compliance. Side effects include the most common temporary trauma to the ears and sinuses or barotraumas due to pressure changes. Mild ear pain is normal and is not of concern. Patients may also experience blurry vision or fatigue while in the pressurized chamber. Complications and serious side effects are uncommon. Occasionally patients may experience oxygen toxicity while in the chamber, which can cause seizures and serious respiratory illness. Particular attention should be given to avoiding flammable items and accidental sparks since a 100% saturated oxygen environment is highly flammable.<BR/>Despite several authors supporting HBO therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Granstr_x00f6_m-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granström 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldmeier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmeier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Granstr_x00f6_m-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granström 2005</LINK>), it remains a controversial issue and some clinicians consider HBO ineffective (<LINK REF="REF-Keller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 1997</LINK>). Those who advocate HBO therapy have based their conclusions on clinical experience, retrospective case control studies (<LINK REF="REF-Granstr_x00f6_m-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granström 1999</LINK>) and experimental animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1997</LINK>). On the other hand, oral implant rehabilitation of irradiated patients has been shown to be successful without adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-Franzen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franzen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to compare dental implant treatment carried out with and without HBO therapy in irradiated patients.</P>

Each domain includes one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, either 'low risk', 'high risk' or, where there is insufficient information on which to base a judgement, 'unclear risk'.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment of the included trials was completed independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. On occasions when the review authors were also authors of trial reports that needed to be assessed, the reports were independently evaluated only by review authors who had not been involved in the trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Both groups received antibiotic prophylaxis with broad-spectrum antibiotics (cephradine 1 g, three times daily during two weeks) starting one day before implant surgery. The test group received 20 hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatments of 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres for 80 minutes (four periods of 20 minutes) before implant surgery, and 10 HBO identical treatments after implant surgery. In all patients Brånemark implants were placed in the interforaminal region of the mandible according to a one-stage procedure. After six months, bar-retained overdentures were delivered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The following data were presented: prosthesis failures as implant failures, radiographic bone level changes (but not used since extrapolated from oblique lateral radiographs), preimplantation complications, postimplantation complications, patient satisfaction. We used the 'overall denture satisfaction', however one patient from the HBO group who lost all the implants during the healing period and could not receive an implant-supported overdenture was excluded from the trial. This was not correct since the treatment was clearly a failure, but its potentially negative consequences were not accounted for. Cost effectiveness data were not presented but it was possible to extrapolate this.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:41:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schoen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schoen 2007</LINK>) included 13 patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy and 13 patients who did not receive HBO therapy. Two patients, one from each group, died during the healing period of the implants. One year after placement of the overdentures three additional patients in each group were no longer alive. Eight implants failed in five patients subjected to HBO therapy versus three implants in two patients in the control group. Two postoperative complications (one osteoradionecrosis and some minor soft tissue complications) developed in two patients subjected to HBO therapy. The patient affected by osteoradionecrosis lost all implants, the implant-supported prosthesis could not be fabricated and patient satisfaction was not evaluated. One year after delivery of the prosthesis there were no statistically significant differences for any of the outcome measures (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:48:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The question of whether or not hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is effective for implant success in irradiated patients is important. HBO therapy requires significant patient compliance and involves substantial financial expense in terms of cost per patient treatment and the equipment. It is not without risk of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Readers should be aware that the 'evidence' on this matter remains highly controversial. For instance, another Cochrane systematic review suggested a limited advantage of HBO therapy in reducing the chances of osteoradionecrosis in irradiated tooth sockets following dental extractions (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2012</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:48:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one trial at high risk of bias compared HBO with no HBO and the results failed to determine a benefit for HBO therapy in preventing failures of dental implants or other serious complications such as osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (<LINK REF="STD-Schoen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schoen 2007</LINK>) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the increased number of implant losses, irradiation therapy cannot be considered an absolute contraindication to dental implants in the mandible. In fact, only three out of the 26 patients included in the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schoen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schoen 2007</LINK>) did not benefit from their implant-supported overdentures. Two patients died during the implant healing period, and all implants failed in another patient because of osteoradionecrosis so that the overdenture could not be fabricated. From the trial it clearly emerges that implant-retained mandibular overdentures improve life quality in terms of oral function and denture satisfaction in patients treated for head and neck cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Schoen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schoen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is a definite need for more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to ascertain the effectiveness of HBO therapy in irradiated patients requiring dental implants. These trials ought to be of a high quality and reported as recommended by the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>).
