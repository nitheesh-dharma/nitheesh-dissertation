<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:30:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of angioplasty for intracranial artery stenosis. Narrowing of the arteries inside the skull is a significant cause of stroke. Medical treatment for prevention consists of the control of risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Blood thinners are also used, but none has been demonstrated to be superior to another. Angioplasty, a procedure for opening narrowed arteries by means of a balloon or stent, is feasible but its safety and efficacy is not known. This review found no randomised controlled trials and no evidence to support the use of this procedure in routine practice. More research is needed to establish the role of this procedure in the treatment of this disease.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Intracranial artery stenosis causes up to 10% of all ischaemic strokes. The rate of recurrent vascular ischaemic events is very high. Angioplasty with or without stent placement is a feasible procedure to dilate the vessel affected. However, its safety and efficacy have not been systematically studied.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of angioplasty combined with best medical treatment compared with best medical treatment alone in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) resulting from intracranial artery stenosis for preventing recurrent ischaemic strokes, death, and vascular events.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2006). In addition we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1980 to February 2006) and Science Citation Index (1945 to March 2006). To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors and experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or otherwise controlled studies comparing best medical care plus angioplasty of the intracranial cerebral arteries, with or without stent placement, with best medical care alone. Studies were only included if data for clinical significant endpoints such as recurrent ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke and death were available. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors selected trials for inclusion, and independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Calculation of relative treatment effects with subgroup analysis was done if possible. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No randomised controlled trials were found. There were 79 articles of interest consisting of open-label case series with three or more cases. The safety profile of the procedure showed an overall perioperative rate of stroke of 7.9% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 5.5% to 10.4%), perioperative death of 3.4% (95% CI 2.0% to 4.8%), and perioperative stroke or death of 9.5% (95% CI 7.0% to 12.0%). No comments can be made on the effectiveness of the procedure.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>At present there is insufficient evidence to recommend angioplasty with or without stent placement in routine practice for the prevention of stroke in patients with intracranial artery stenosis. The descriptive studies show that the procedure is feasible although carries a significant morbidity and mortality risk. Evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to assess the safety of angioplasty and its effectiveness in preventing recurrent stroke.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Intracranial artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis is a significant cause of ischaemic stroke, accounting for 5% to 10% of all ischaemic strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hass-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hass 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacco-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacco 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wityk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wityk 1996</LINK>). Although the annual risk of stroke in patients with intracranial artery stenosis was estimated at 3% to 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Bogousslavsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogousslavsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corston-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corston 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EC_x002f_IC-Bypass-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC/IC Bypass 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hinton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinton 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marzewski-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marzewski 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moufarrij-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moufarrij 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pessin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pessin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WASID-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WASID 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wechsler-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wechsler 1986</LINK>) a recent clinical trial showed a risk of recurrent vascular events at 15% to 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasner 2006</LINK>). Patients with severe stenosis of the vertebral artery, the basilar artery, or both, are at particularly high risk of recurrent stroke despite antithrombotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thijs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thijs 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WASID-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WASID 1998</LINK>). Retrospective studies suggested that chronic anticoagulation with warfarin was the best therapeutic alternative (<LINK REF="REF-Benesch-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benesch 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WASID-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WASID 1998</LINK>); however, a randomised trial showed no benefit of warfarin over aspirin for the prevention of stroke or vascular events. Moreover, its use was associated with higher rates of adverse events such as bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 2005</LINK>). Despite claims of ballon angioplasty low complication rate associated with improved experience and technology (<LINK REF="REF-Gomez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 2001</LINK>), the reported rate of stroke or death during or after angioplasty ranges from 3% to 40%. Even fewer data exist on the evaluation of cerebral artery stenting. Although there have been several large series undertaken, these have included rather heterogeneous groups of patients with variable follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Chebl-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Chebl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alazzaz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alazzaz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barakate-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barakate 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callahan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callahan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connors-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomez-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 2000b</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Gomez-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mori-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mori 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qureshi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qureshi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>). In this systematic review of all randomised or otherwise controlled studies, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of angioplasty with or without stent placement and medical care with medical care alone in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with or without stent placement combined with best medical care compared to best medical care alone in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:39:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:34:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We sought all randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing best medical care plus angioplasty of the intracranial cerebral arteries, with or without stent placement, with best medical care alone. Studies were only included if data for clinically significant endpoints such as ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke and death were available. Studies were assessed for comparability between both treatment assignment groups for major factors including age, gender, type of clinical presentation (asymptomatic versus stroke versus transient ischaemic attack), stroke location, vessel involved, time to randomisation, and time of follow up. Valid endpoints included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, death. An assessment was made of all complications related to the procedure and other endpoints such as length of stay and readmissions to hospital.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials including patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic intracranial cerebral artery stenosis caused by atherosclerosis were considered eligible for inclusion in this review. Intracranial stenosis was defined as stenosis greater than 50% only by conventional angiography. Symptomatic patients were defined as those people that presented with a transient ischaemic attack or an ischaemic stroke in the territory of the stenosed vessel. Studies including patients treated with angioplasty or stent placement or both as a salvage or rescue procedure during an acute ischaemic event with acute vascular occlusion were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Angioplasty was defined as the percutaneous insertion of an endovascular catheter with a balloon designed to inflate at areas of vascular stenosis to dilate the vascular lumen. Stent placement refers to the deployment of a metallic mesh of a tubular device designed to dilate an area of vascular stenosis.</P>
<P>Trials with the following characteristics of the interventions were included.<BR/>(1) The active treatment group involved intracranial artery angioplasty with or without stent placement on a background of best medical treatment that included antithrombotic therapy.<BR/>(2) The control group involved medical treatment alone based on antithrombotic therapy that included antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant agents alone or in combination. Antithrombotic therapy is defined as the use of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant agents, alone or in combination.</P>
<P>We planned to examine the patterns of medical care between the two arms of a study to determine any potential for confounding. The areas of medical care considered included use of antithrombotic agents, use of anticoagulation, specialist nursing, medical care or both, and variation in follow up. If such discrepancies existed between the arms, the study was considered poorly controlled and therefore was excluded from this review.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:34:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We planned an intention-to-treat analysis. We sought the number of patients allocated to each treatment arm in each trial. Outcomes were analysed at 30 days and at one year after randomisation. A perioperative outcome was defined as an endpoint occurring during the procedure or within 30 days of the procedure. We divided the endpoints into primary and secondary outcomes as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Stroke in the vascular territory of the stenosed vessel, either ischaemic or haemorrhagic after randomisation. First stroke, either ischaemic or haemorrhagic occurring after randomisation (for asymptomatic patients).</LI>
<LI>Death</LI>
<LI>Stroke or death</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Restenosis of the involved vessel documented by conventional cerebral angiography. Restenoses were classified as: (1) symptomatic, (2) asymptomatic.</LI>
<LI>Other perioperative complications. These were classified as: (1) major; those requiring additional therapy, prolonged hospital stay or causing death, (2) minor; hematoma, wound infection, nerve palsy.</LI>
<LI>Hospital length of stay</LI>
<LI>Re-admission</LI>
</UL>
<P>Strokes were classified, if possible, as disabling or non-disabling. Disabling stroke was defined by the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) of 2 or 3 (<LINK REF="REF-Jennett-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennett 1975</LINK>), a modified Rankin score (MRS) 3, 4, or 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Rankin-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rankin 1957</LINK>), or a Barthel index less than 80 out of 100 (<LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 1965</LINK>). In the studies that do not provide information using a valid scale, we estimated the proportion of disabling stroke by seeking further detail if necessary. The GOS is often misquoted, with the scale inverted, and care was taken interpreting data given in this form. Death was considered a poor outcome. Restenosis was defined as stenosis greater than 50% from the original lumen diameter.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:39:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The review authors (SCF and ALD) inspected the titles identified by the searches. Both review authors independently examined abstracts of references with titles of interest to determine their relevance. Where it was not clear from the abstract if the trial was relevant, or if no abstract was available, we obtained a copy of the article. We tried to contact the study author if further clarification was necessary. Any study deemed relevant was critically appraised using the checklist developed by Fowkes and Fulton (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). Review authors discussed limitations of studies with a view to inclusion. Both review authors independently extracted and cross-checked data from the included studies on to a pro-forma. We specifically sought the following information.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Method of randomisation and whether the randomising physician was blind to the treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>Method of measuring outcome and whether the adjudication of outcome was done independently, blindly, or both, to treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>Number of exclusions and losses to follow up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. We planned to calculate the relative treatment effects by using a fixed-effect model, and expressing odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. We decided to use the Peto method to calculate odds ratios. Subgroup analyses were planned to stratify participants by the presence or absence of symptoms prior to the procedure, gender, degree of stenosis, and angioplasty alone or in combination with stent placement. To perform these analyses we looked for the presence or absence of overlap between the confidence intervals of the summary estimates of the groups considered. When in doubt, because of a small visual overlap in the confidence intervals, we used the significance test recommended by Deeks (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). We planned to perform sensitivity analyses to assess the effects on outcomes according to the degree of concealment of allocation, blinded outcome assessor or not, and degree of dropout. Heterogeneity would be sought by using the chi-squared test. If heterogeneity was found we planned to discuss it and consult a statistician. We used The Cochrane Collaboration software Review Manager (RevMan 4.2).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:39:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>No completed or ongoing randomised controlled trials, or studies with comparative data, were found. Seventy-nine articles with anecdotal case series were found, and are detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. These comprise a total of 1999 cases, spread among series of different sizes.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>No studies had methods suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis of controlled trials. The available data consisted of case series and anecdotal reports (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The patient characteristics, procedural methods and medical management made this population very heterogeneous. The participants were all selected from a population with an estimated high risk for recurrent stroke and death. Additionally, these studies defined success and good outcome differently. No attempt to quantify the effect of the treatment was made, as no comparison groups were found. Although these reports showed that angioplasty with or without stent placement can be performed, the associated complication rate and survival ranged from 0% to 50%. No comment can be made regarding the efficacy of the procedure since these reports might be subject to reporting bias. In fact, the series with fewer participants had the lower rate of complications reported.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>No relevant trials were found in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register or the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). A total of 5884 references were retrieved from the electronic databases searches of which 79 were articles of interest comprising a total 1999 participants. Citation tracking identified further articles but no relevant trials. An ISCI search showed no further citations as all had already been retrieved by the EMBASE and MEDLINE searches. The rate for perioperative stroke was 7.95% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 5.5% to 10.4%) (range 0% to 50%), perioperative death 3.4% (95% CI 2.0% to 4.8%) (range 0% to 33%), perioperative stroke or death 9.5% (95% CI 7.0% to 12.0%) (range 0% to 50%), and other perioperative complications (such as groin hematoma and arterial dissection) 9.88% (95% CI 6.4% to 13.4%) (range 0% to 75%). Additionally, in those studies with follow up of at least one year, the risk of stroke or death was 5.6% (95% CI 3.7% to 7.6%) (range 0% to 50%).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The studies retrieved consist of open label case reports and case series providing descriptive data and, therefore, no meta-analytic approach was pursued. These data suggest that angioplasty with or without stent placement of the intracranial vessel is a feasible procedure but no comments can be made with regards to the effectiveness of the procedure. In addition, it is clear that the rate of complications can be very high. The evidence from the most recent randomised trial comparing warfarin to aspirin for the prevention of vascular events in patients with intracranial artery stenosis clearly indicates a very high annual risk of both stroke (20%) and the combined endpoint stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death (23%) (<LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasner 2006</LINK>). Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that angioplasty is the treatment of choice considering the high rate of complications reported to date in open label series that did not use randomisation, concealment of allocation, or blinded outcome assessment. Furthermore, two important facts from the WASID trial (<LINK REF="REF-Chimowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimowitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasner 2006</LINK>) need to be considered: first, the risk of recurrent stroke is highest within the first two weeks from the initial stroke; and second, the risk of stroke is highest among those patients with stenosis greater than 70%. Our findings and those from the WASID trial suggest that before adopting angioplasty with or without stent placement for intracranial stenosis in routine clinical practice, randomised controlled trials on this intervention should target the population at highest risk of recurrent stroke, such as those patients within two weeks from their initial event and those with stenosis greater than 70%, as an invasive, high-risk intervention may not be warranted in patients without these findings. Therefore, results from well-controlled trials are required before adopting this treatment for routine practice. </P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-16 11:40:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A controlled clinical trial comparing angioplasty with or without stent placement with best medical treatment is needed. Considering the average rate of complications found in the case series, such a trial must target the population at highest risk of recurrent stroke. In fact, assuming that the rate of stroke in this population is 20% per year and considering the point estimates (with its confidence intervals) for complication rates from angioplasty observed in this review, a trial comparing angioplasty with best medical treatment and alpha of 0.05, power of 80% and an expected relative risk reduction of 25%, will require 950 participants per treatment arm and a perioperative rate of stroke or death of less than 7%. A similar trial with an expected relative risk reduction of 50% will require 220 participants per treatment arm and a perioperative rate of stroke or death less than 3%.</P>
