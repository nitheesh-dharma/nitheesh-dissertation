<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-13 09:22:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan (brand name: Cozaar), candesartan (Atacand), eprosartan (Teveten), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan (Micardis) and valsartan (Diovan) are commonly used to treat heart failure. We asked whether ARBs reduced death, or severe disability as assessed by hospital admission for any reason versus an inert substance (placebo) or another class of drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as ramipril (Altace), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), and quinapril (Accupril). We also asked whether combining an ARB with an ACE inhibitor is more effective than an ACE inhibitor alone in reducing death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason. The scientific literature was searched to find all trials that had assessed these questions.</P>
<P>We found 24 trials that randomly assigned participants to take either an ARB or control substance (placebo or ACEI). These trials evaluated ARBs in 25,051 patients with heart failure and followed them for 2 years. ARBs were no better than placebo or ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason. However, more patients stopped treatment early with ARBs than with placebo due to side effects. Adding an ARB to an ACEI also did not reduce the risk of death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason as compared to ACEI alone, although more patients taking the combination stopped early due to side effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-13 11:40:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic heart failure (HF) is a serious condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, the goal of any pharmacological therapy is to lower the risk of adverse clinical outcomes associated with this chronic disease. </P>
<P>It is a well-known fact that excess activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) contributes to the pathophysiology of heart failure. Activation of the RAS results in increased production of angiotensin I (AI), which is converted to angiotensin II (AII) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). AII is a potent vasoconstrictor and also stimulates aldosterone secretion, which increases sodium and water retention (<LINK REF="REF-Erhardt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erhardt 2005</LINK>). AII and aldosterone are also implicated in other potentially deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, including endothelial damage, sympathetic activation, collagen formation and decreased nitric oxide production (<LINK REF="REF-Erhardt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erhardt 2005</LINK>). Together, these effects put a strain on the heart, which can eventually lead to heart failure. With the understanding that the RAS plays such a vital role in the progression of heart failure, two drug classes, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), were developed to inhibit the RAS and thus provide a potentially beneficial therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</P>
<P>ACE inhibitors are indicated as first-line treatment for HF (<LINK REF="REF-ACCF_x002f_AHA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCF/AHA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CCS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC 2008</LINK>) because they have been conclusively demonstrated in major clinical trials evaluating morbidity and mortality to reduce mortality as well as rates of reinfarction and hospitalizations for heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Flather-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flather 2000</LINK>). ACE inhibitors achieve their favourable effects by blocking the production of AII, thereby inhibiting its biological effects, such as enhanced vasoconstriction and excessive sodium and water retention. The favourable effect of ACE inhibitors may also be partly attributed to the fact that ACE is identical to another enzyme called kininase II that is responsible for kinin degradation. By retarding degradation of bradykinin, ACE inhibitors prolong its beneficial vasodilatory and antitrophic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK>). However, the accumulation of bradykinin in the lung probably causes the side effect of dry cough and possibly other side effects that force some patients to discontinue treatment with ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-McMurray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurray 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initially, it was believed that ACE is the only enzyme that will catalyze the production of AII from AI. However, it is unclear how complete the blockade by ACE inhibitors is and if there is continuing angiotensin II formation during chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Wolny-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolny 1997</LINK>). Numerous studies have now shown that some patients on long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors eventually have AII levels return to pretreatment levels, demonstrating that the blockade of the RAS by the ACE inhibitor is incomplete. This phenomenon is referred to as &#8220;ACE escape&#8221; and it may be the result of AII formation through non-ACE-dependent pathways. For example, chymase, a serine protease found in the human heart and other tissues, is able to form AII from AI and is not blocked by ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Wolny-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolny 1997</LINK>). The physiological significance of these non-ACE-dependent pathways for AII formation is not known at the present time.</P>
<P>In contrast, RAS blockade with ARBs is achieved by inhibiting the binding of AII to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which is believed to mediate the harmful cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. ARBs are believed to provide a more effective means of blockade of the RAS than is possible with ACE inhibitors because this blockade at the receptor level is independent of the pathway for AII formation (<LINK REF="REF-Erhardt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erhardt 2005</LINK>). In addition, this drug class allows the displaced AII to continue to bind to the angiotensin II type II (AT2) receptors that are not blocked by ARBs. Since AT2 receptors are believed to mediate favourable vasodilatory and anti-trophic effects, this unopposed stimulation of the AT2 receptors may confer a theoretical advantage with ARBs over ACE inhibitors [<LINK REF="REF-Azizi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azizi 2004</LINK>]. Furthermore, ARBs may be better tolerated since they do not interfere with the degradation of bradykinin that is responsible for cough and possibly other side effects of ACE inhibitors.</P>
<P>Despite their theoretical benefits, several clinical practice guidelines recommend ARBs only in ACE-intolerant patients because clinical trial evidence of their effectiveness in heart failure patients is less robust yet ARBs are still widely prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-ACCF_x002f_AHA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCF/AHA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CCS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC 2008</LINK>). A systematic review of existing trial data may therefore provide new insights on the use of this drug class in patients with HF.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-13 11:40:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In recent years, several meta-analyses evaluating ARBs for HF have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lakhdar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakhdar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shibata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibata 2008</LINK>). In fact, the authors who originally developed the protocol for this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002b</LINK>) decided to publish the results of their meta-analysis elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK>). Subsequently a published meta-analysis included all 17 studies from <LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK> as well as an additional five studies, totaling 22 studies evaluating ARBs in HF patients and LVEF &#8804;40% (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>). No new trials in patients with HF and LVEF &#8804;40% have been published since <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>, which quantifies the effect of ARBs when compared with placebo (with and without background ACE inhibitors) and ACE inhibitors on all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisations. This meta-analysis concluded that there was a reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76 to 1.00]; ARR=7.1%, NNT=14, p=0.05) with ARBs and HF hospitalisations (RR 0.71 [95% CI 0.61 to 0.82]; ARR=7.9%, NNT=13, p&lt;0.00001), as compared to placebo. For ARBs versus ACE inhibitors, all-cause mortality (RR 1.05 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.22]) and HF hospitalisations (RR 0.96 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.11]) did not differ. For ARB plus ACE inhibitor combinations versus ACE inhibitors alone, all-cause mortality was not reduced (RR 0.98 [95% CI 0.90 to 1.06]) but HF hospitalisations were reduced (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.74 to 0.89]; ARR=4.4%; NNT=23; p&lt;0.00001).</P>
<P>Of the 22 chronic HF trials included in the meta-analysis, 17 were short-term studies evaluating the effect of an ARB on cardiac haemodynamic and/or neurohormonal parameters. They were not designed to assess the long-term impact of ARBs on mortality or morbidity and contribute very little (&lt; 2% per trial) to the overall estimate of the effect of ARBs on all-cause mortality and hospitalisations for HF.</P>
<P>Four large-scale trials (<LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Added-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Added 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Alternative-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Alternative 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ELITE-II-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE II 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Val_x002d_HeFT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Val-HeFT 2001</LINK>) contribute nearly all of the data to the meta-analysis. However, the <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK> meta-analysis is limited to only two outcomes (all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations), whereas each trial reports on other mortality and morbidity outcomes, as well as withdrawals due to adverse effects. Furthermore, a recent systematic review of two large-scale studies evaluating ARBs in patients with HF and preserved systolic function (LVEF &gt;40%) has also limited its meta-analysis to all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, the purpose of this review is not only to provide an update on the available literature, but also to more completely evaluate the data from large-scale clinical trials using a broader range of outcomes in order to get a more complete understanding of the benefit and harm of ARBs in the treatment of chronic heart failure.</P>

<P>The protocol for this review was first published in Issue 2, 2001 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002b</LINK>). The authors published the results of their meta-analysis a year later in another medical journal (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK>). However, the full Cochrane review has never been published. In 2009, we took over the protocol in order to complete the systematic review according to the rigorous quality standards of The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>The strategies included in the published Cochrane protocol to search the bibliographic databases for potentially relevant studies (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002b</LINK>) have been listed in the appendices (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). It is not possible to know if these exact search strategies have been used for the review since the published report did not include the search strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, other systematic reviews have also been published in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Lakhdar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakhdar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shibata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibata 2008</LINK>), which have served to independently verify that <LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK> identified all relevant studies evaluating ARBs for HF up to May 2001.

<P>Search strategies were designed with reference to those of the previous systematic review and in accordance with the Cochrane Heart Group methods and guidance. Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining a modified form of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms relating to angiotensin receptor blockers and heart failure. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into the other databases using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable.<BR/>

<P>Searches have been limited to randomised controlled trials and a filter applied to limit by humans. No language restrictions have been applied. Consideration was given to variations in terms used and spellings of terms in different countries so that studies were not missed by the search strategy because of such variations.</P>

This suggests that investigators have knowledge of each participant&#8217;s prior experience with this drug class and, thus, may select for patients who have responded favourably or have been found to tolerate treatment with ARBs. It was possible for us to prove selection bias in terms of WDAE (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Two included trials compared ARBs with placebo in patients with HF and a preserved EF (<LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Preserved-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Preserved 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-I_x002d_PRESERVE-2008" TYPE="STUDY">I-PRESERVE 2008</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Preserved-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Preserved 2003</LINK> trial, which did not exclude patients who demonstrated a previous ARB intolerance, there was a statistically significant increase in WDAE in patients treated with candesartan as compared to placebo (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.12, 1.56]). In contrast, the increase in WDAE with irbesartan <LINK REF="STD-I_x002d_PRESERVE-2008" TYPE="STUDY">I-PRESERVE 2008</LINK> trial did not reach statistical significance compared with placebo (RR 1.15 [95% CI 0.99, 1.33]).</P>
<P>Two smaller studies (<LINK REF="STD-ARCH_x002d_J-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ARCH-J 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamroff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hamroff 1999</LINK>) included an ARB tolerability phase and those patients with a confirmed intolerance of an ARB were excluded prior to randomisation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding these two studies and the results of the meta-analysis were not affected.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Twenty three (96%) of the 24 included trials were sponsored by the manufacturer of the ARB being studied and one study did not report the source of funding. Given the fact that industry sponsored trials with positive results are selectively published, it is likely that this source of bias has had a significant impact on this review since it only included and appraised published trial evidence.</P>
<P>In order to test for the possibility of publication bias, a funnel plot was created for 9 of the placebo-controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-ARCH_x002d_J-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ARCH-J 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Alternative-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Alternative 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crozier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crozier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazayev-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mazayev 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitrovic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mitrovic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000_x002c_-III_x002d_Int_x0027_l" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000, III-Int'l</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000_x002c_-III_x002d_US" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000, III-US</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPICE-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SPICE 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STRETCH-1999" TYPE="STUDY">STRETCH 1999</LINK>) that reported total mortality in patients with EF &#8804;40%. <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Added-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Added 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-I_x002d_PRESERVE-2008" TYPE="STUDY">I-PRESERVE 2008</LINK> looked at patients with preserved ejection (LVEF &gt;40%) and were therefore excluded from the funnel plot analysis. There was no visual indication of funnel plot asymmetry and the Egger test was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). However, due to the small number of studies the power was too low to reliably test for asymmetry.</P>
<P>Despite this limitation, there was still evidence of publication bias. One publication, a meta-analysis of the effect of losartan on mortality in patients with HF, reported on deaths that occurred in two multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000_x002c_-III_x002d_Int_x0027_l" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000, III-Int'l</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000_x002c_-III_x002d_US" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000, III-US</LINK>). Published reports of the complete data for these two multicenter studies were not identified by our comprehensive search.</P>
<P>Since the source of funding for these trials was almost always the manufacturer, the risk of bias is high. Therefore, we believe that this meta-analysis may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of ARB therapy. All studies, regardless of the findings, need to be published and accessible for secondary analysis in order to accurately assess the benefits and harms associated with this class of drugs.<BR/>

All-cause hospitalisations were not reduced with candesartan compared with placebo. When this outcome was divided according to cause, candesartan reduced the risk of hospital admissions for HF (RR 0.71 [95% CI 0.61, 0.82]; ARR=8.0%; NNT=13) but increased the risk of hospital admissions for other causes (RR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.25]). <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Alternative-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Alternative 2003</LINK> contributed 98% of the data and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in other hospitalisations with candesartan (RR 1.13 [95% CI 1.01, 1.27]; ARI=4.6%; NNH=22). </P>
<P>Since an increase in hospitalisations for other causes can be attributed to a harmful effect of ARB therapy that is unrelated to the exacerbation of heart failure, we combined the data for all HF patients irrespective of LVEF (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).

<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK> included a total of 16 studies that randomly allocated 12,295 patients to either an ARB or control (placebo or ACEI). This review has allowed analysis of an increased number of patients from an additional eight studies published from 2001 to 2008, totaling 24 studies that enrolled 25,051 patients with symptomatic HF. A total of 17,900 patients with a LVEF &#8804;40% were studied in 22 studies (with a weighted mean follow-up of 2.2 years in four large-scale studies (<LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Added-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Added 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Alternative-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Alternative 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ELITE-II-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE II 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Val_x002d_HeFT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Val-HeFT 2001</LINK>) and 7151 patients with a LVEF &gt;40% were studied in two large-scale studies for a weighted mean duration of 3.7 years (<LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Preserved-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Preserved 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-I_x002d_PRESERVE-2008" TYPE="STUDY">I-PRESERVE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ARBs versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Treatment with ARBs in symptomatic HF patients with a LVEF &#8804;40% did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality, stroke, or all-cause hospital admission as compared to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Alternative-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Alternative 2003</LINK>, a large-scale trial in which HF patients who had demonstrated intolerance to ACE inhibitors were treated with candesartan or placebo for a median duration of 33.7 months, contributed 90% or more of the data to the outcome of hospital admission. In this trial, candesartan reduced the risk of hospital admission for HF (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.62, 0.85]; ARR=7.8%; NNT=13) but increased the risk of hospital admission for other causes (RR 1.13 [95% CI 1.01, 1.27]; ARI=4.6%; NNH=22). Candesartan also increased the risk of MI (RR 1.57 [95% CI 1.10, 2.23]; ARI=2.7%; NNT=37) compared with placebo, which may partly explain the significant increase in other hospitalisations observed in this trial. A recently published systematic review evaluating the effect of ARBs in all major trials reporting MI did not demonstrate an increased risk of MI with ARBs as compared to other drugs or placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Volpe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 2009</LINK>). However, we cannot be certain all unpublished trials are accounted for and data not reported in existing published trials are needed to confirm the findings of this meta-analysis.</P>
<P>There is no available RCT evidence that demonstrates that any individual ARB is more or less effective than another in the treatment of HF. In fact, the data included in this review showed no reduction in total mortality or total hospitalizations when candesartan or valsartan studies were pooled. Elevated blood pressure is in most cases the predominant contributor to the development and progression of HF. ARBs or any other antihypertensive agents have not been shown to provide any benefit beyond BP lowering. The evidence (46 studies, n=13,451) from a Cochrane review of the BP lowering efficacy of ARBs for primary hypertension suggests that there are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between available ARBs (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In symptomatic HF patients with a LVEF &gt;40%, ARB therapy did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality or all-cause hospital admission compared with placebo. A statistically marginal reduction in hospitalisations for HF with ARBs was counteracted by a non-significant increase in other hospitalisations. Rates of stroke and MI were not reported.</P>
<P>We pooled the data for all HF patients, irrespective of LVEF, to fully examine the effect of ARBs on hospital admission for other causes and there was a significantly increased risk of hospitalisations for other causes compared with placebo (RR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01, 1.12]; ARI=1.4%; NNH=72). We also pooled WDAE data from all placebo-controlled studies and significantly more patients in the ARB group stopped treatment early due to adverse effects (RR 1.19 [95% CI 1.09, 1.30]; ARI=1.4%; NNH=72). These findings are in contrast with the widely held belief in the literature that ARBs have a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Mancia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mancia 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We pooled trials that compared ARBs with ACE inhibitors in symptomatic HF patients with a LVEF &#8804;40% and there appears to be no difference between the two drug classes in total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, MI, total hospitalisations, or hospitalisations for HF. ARBs were found to be superior to ACE inhibitors in tolerability with a significantly lower rate of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.52, 0.76]; ARR=6.0%; NNT=17).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ARB plus ACEI versus ACEI alone</HEADING>
<P>In symptomatic HF patients with a LVEF &#8804;40%, the addition of an ARB to an ACE inhibitor was not effective in reducing total mortality or cardiovascular mortality compared with ACE inhibitor therapy alone. Combination therapy reduced hospitalisations for HF (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.74, 0.89]; ARR=4.4%; NNT=23) but a non-significant increase in hospital admissions for other causes (RR 1.07 [95% CI 0.98, 1.18]) was also observed, resulting in no significant difference between combination and ACE inhibitor monotherapy in all-cause hospital admissions. The risk of stroke was not reduced but the risk of MI (RR 0.64 [95% CI 0.44, 0.92]; ARR=2.0%; NNT=50) was reduced with combination therapy. More patients receiving ARB plus ACE inhibitor combination had to stop treatment prematurely because of adverse effects (RR 1.34 [95% CI 1.19, 1.51]; ARI=3.7%; NNH=27).</P>
<P>Our search did not identify any studies that compared ARB plus ACE inhibitor combination therapy with ACE inhibitor alone in HF patients with a LVEF &gt;40%.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-13 11:55:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are important differences between our review and previously published meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shibata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibata 2008</LINK>), including the non-Cochrane meta-analysis published by the authors who originally developed this protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Jong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jong 2002</LINK>).  The major limitation with these other reviews is that they have limited their analyses to total mortality and hospital admission for worsening HF. Our review also analysed other clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular mortality, total hospitalisations, hospitalisations for other causes, stroke, MI, and withdrawals due to adverse effects, in an attempt to fully elucidate the benefit and harm of ARB treatment in HF patients based on published data from large-scale clinical trials.<B> </B>In particular, all-cause hospital admission is a useful measure of total morbidity and was reported in three of four large-scale studies. Other useful indexes of morbidity would be total length of hospital admission or days in ICU or on a ventilator; however, these outcomes were not reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>By expanding our analysis, we have observed some effects of ARBs that have not been reported in other meta-analyses. For instance, the reduction in hospitalisations for HF with ARBs compared with placebo has been reported previously. However, the increase in hospitalisations for other causes with ARBs observed in our review has not been reported before. Given that in these trials the majority of total hospital admissions is to due to reasons other than worsening symptoms of HF, and the fact that total hospitalisations for any cause are not reduced, this suggests that there is no net health benefit of ARBs. If this is true the use of ARBs in this setting is called into question.</P>
<P>It is commonly accepted that ACEI reduce mortality and morbidity and therefore have become standard therapy in HF patients (<LINK REF="REF-ACCF_x002f_AHA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCF/AHA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CCS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC 2008</LINK>). We therefore decided to review the findings of a meta-analysis of data from individual patients with HF or left-ventricular dysfunction that is frequently cited to support that claim (<LINK REF="REF-Flather-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flather 2000</LINK>). The authors of this systematic overview collected individual patient data from three large-scale studies (n=5966) that enrolled acute MI patients (<LINK REF="REF-AIRE-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIRE 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SAVE-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAVE 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TRACE-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRACE 1995</LINK>) and two studies (n=6797) that enrolled patients with chronic HF (<LINK REF="REF-SOLVD-treatment-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLVD treatment 1991</LINK>) or LV dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-SOLVD-prevention-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLVD prevention 1992</LINK>) who were randomly assigned to an ACEI or placebo and continued treatment for at least a year.</P>
<P>When the analysis was limited to the SOLVD treatment and prevention trials of enalapril in chronic HF, the ACEI group had lower rates of mortality (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.78, 0.98]), reinfarction (OR 0.78 [95% CI 0.65, 0.92]) and readmission for HF (OR 0.63 [95% CI 0.56, 0.72]) than with placebo. The <LINK REF="REF-Flather-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flather 2000</LINK> meta-analysis did not report total hospitalisations so we retrieved the published reports of <LINK REF="REF-SOLVD-treatment-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLVD treatment 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-SOLVD-prevention-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLVD prevention 1992</LINK> for these data. When these 2 studies were pooled, total hospitalisations (RR 0.96 [95% CI 0.92, 0.99]) and hospitalisations for HF (RR 0.69 [95% CI 0.63, 0.77]) were significantly reduced with enalapril (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). However, hospitalisations due to other causes were significantly increased (RR 1.10 [95% CI 1.04, 1.16]) with enalapril as compared to placebo (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), a finding consistent with what he have observed with ARBs.</P>
<P>Given this information, the finding in the present review that ARBs are not effective in terms or mortality and morbidity versus placebo is surprising and inconsistent with the finding that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not different when compared directly. We cannot completely resolve this inconsistency; however, it is possible that we may have missed a modest benefit of ARBs compared to placebo in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction. The mortality effect for ARBs (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76, 1.00] versus ACE inhibitors (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.78, 0.98] and the total hospitalisations effect for ARBs (RR 0.94 [95% CI 0.88, 1.01] versus ACE inhibitors (RR 0.96 [0.92, 0.99] is not necessarily that different.</P>
<P>Where other meta-analyses also failed to include WDAE as a safety outcome, we pooled all studies that reported this outcome and observed a higher rate in patients taking ARBs as compared to placebo. We also observed a higher rate of WDAE in patients taking ARB plus ACEI combination therapy versus an ACE inhibitor alone.</P>
<P>Overall, given the lack of proven benefit with ARBs in terms of total mortality and total hospitalisations as compared to placebo and a proven benefit of ACE inhibitors as compared to placebo, it is clear that ACE inhibitor should be the first choice class of drugs in HF patients.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-13 11:57:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has revealed several significant limitations in the available RCT evidence, most notably the poor reporting of methodology in many trial publications. The method of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was rarely described. Although the quality of reporting tended to be better in long-term health outcome studies, details on the methodology was still incomplete.</P>
<P>All but one of the 24 included studies were sponsored by the manufacturer making a high risk of publication bias and other biases likely. It was not possible for us to determine the existence of publication bias by analysing funnel plots for asymmetry due to an insufficient number of included studies. However, we were able to find evidence of unpublished studies during our search for relevant studies. <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2000</LINK> was an industry-sponsored meta-analysis of losartan for HF that included 2 unpublished placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The full reports of these 2 studies have not been published elsewhere. Therefore, it is possible that our inability to identify unpublished studies with negative results may have led to overestimation of treatment effects in our review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, this meta-analysis may under-estimate the harms associated with ARB therapy as a result of patient selection bias. In one of two large-scale trials in HF patients with preserved systolic function, participants with a previously documented intolerance of ARBs were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-I_x002d_PRESERVE-2008" TYPE="STUDY">I-PRESERVE 2008</LINK>). This source of bias clearly influenced the outcome of WDAE since in <LINK REF="STD-I_x002d_PRESERVE-2008" TYPE="STUDY">I-PRESERVE 2008</LINK> trial there was no increase in WDAE with irbesartan compared with placebo, yet in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-CHARM_x002d_Preserved-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CHARM-Preserved 2003</LINK>) WDAE were significantly higher with candesartan, which did not select for patients who were tolerant of ARBs. Overall, significantly more patients treated with ARBs discontinued prematurely due to an adverse effect (RR 1.22 [95% CI 1.09, 1.36]; ARI=3%; NNH=33).</P>

<P>ARBs do not reduce total mortality or all-cause hospitalisations compared with placebo in the treatment of HF patients irrespective of LVEF. In HF patients with LVEF &#8804;40%, the benefit observed with ARBs in terms of a reduction in hospitalisations for HF was mitigated by an increase in hospitalisations for other causes. More patients treated with ARBs stopped treatment early due to adverse effects compared with placebo.</P>

<P>In placebo-controlled trials, the higher rate of hospitalisations for other causes in patients treated with ARBs is a key observation. The majority of total hospital admissions in the included studies is to due to reasons other than worsening symptoms of HF. This potentially harmful effect of ARBs needs to be investigated further by exploring the causes of hospital admission using individual patient data.</P>
