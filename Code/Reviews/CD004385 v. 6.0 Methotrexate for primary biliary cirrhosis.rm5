<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-08 19:40:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology, affecting mostly women. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist with immunosuppressive properties, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the evidence did not show a clear benefit of methotrexate on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This review is based on five randomised trials; four comparing methotrexate with placebo, and one comparing methotrexate with colchicine. Methotrexate, compared with placebo, has no significant beneficial effect on mortality and the need for liver transplantation is not significantly reduced. The effects of methotrexate on pruritus, fatigue, clinical complications, liver biochemistry levels, liver histology, and adverse events were not significantly different from placebo. There may be some beneficial effect on pruritus score (ie, an objective measure of subjective feeling of pruritus), but we cannot recommend methotrexate for this indication only, taken into account possible adverse events. In the small trial comparing methotrexate versus colchicine, methotrexate seemed to work superior to colchicine, but it is not clear if this stems from the fact that methotrexate exerts beneficial effects as colchicine exerts harmful effects. In comparison with both placebo and colchicine, methotrexate was associated with large risks of mortality and adverse events, but the increase did not reach statistical significance. </P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-18 16:17:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We searched to include randomised clinical trials comparing methotrexate with placebo, no intervention, or another drug irrespective of blinding, language, year of publication, or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-19 18:02:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our primary outcomes were mortality, and mortality or liver transplantation combined. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) if applicable. Continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-08 19:34:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Five trials were included. Four trials with 370 patients compared methotrexate with placebo or no intervention (three trials added an equal dose of ursodeoxycholic acid to the intervention groups). The bias risk of these trials was high. We did not find statistically significant effects of methotrexate on mortality (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.64), mortality or liver transplantation combined, pruritus, fatigue, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, or adverse events. The pruritus score (MD - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.25 to - 0.09) was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate. The prothrombin time was significantly worsened in patients receiving methotrexate (MD 1.60 s, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.02). One trial with 85 patients compared methotrexate with colchicine. The trial had low risk of bias. Methotrexate, when compared to colchicine, did not significantly effect mortality, fatigue, liver biopsy, or adverse events. Methotrexate significantly benefited pruritus score (MD - 0.68, 95% CI - 1.11 to - 0.25), serum alkaline phosphatases (MD - 0.41 U/l, 95% CI - 0.70 to - 0.12), and plasma immunoglobulin M (MD - 0.47 mg/dl, 95% CI - 0.74 to - 0.20) compared with colchicine. Other outcomes showed no statistical difference.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-18 16:17:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Methotrexate had no statistically significant effect on mortality in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis nor the need for liver transplantation. Although methotrexate may benefit other outcomes (pruritus score, serum alkaline phosphatase, immunoglobulin M levels), there is no sufficient evidence to support methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-08 19:41:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology. Ninety per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are females, and the majority are diagnosed after the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-James-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1981</LINK>). Over the past 30 years, several studies have reported an increase in the incidence of primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is now a frequent cause of liver morbidity, and patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are significant users of health resources, including liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is classically defined on the basis of the triad: antimitochondrial antibodies, found in over 95 per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fregeau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fregeau 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacerda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacerda 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Invernizzi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Invernizzi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turchany-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turchany 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattalia-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattalia 1998</LINK>); abnormal liver function tests that are typically cholestatic (with raised activity of alkaline phosphatases being the most frequently seen abnormality); and characteristic liver histological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheuer-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheuer 1967</LINK>) in the absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1996</LINK>). Patients may either be diagnosed during a symptomatic phase (the common symptoms being pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, liver enlargement, signs of portal hypertension, sicca complex, and scleroderma-like lesions), in which case survival is significantly decreased, or during an asymptomatic phase, which has a relatively favourable prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balasubramaniam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasubramaniam 1990</LINK>). However, between 40 and 100 per cent of these patients will subsequently develop symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nyberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metcalf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalf 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prince-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the aetiology remains unknown, primary biliary cirrhosis is in many respects analogous to the graft-versus-host syndrome in which the immune system is sensitised to foreign proteins. Histologically, primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by portal inflammation and necrosis of epithelial cells in the small and medium sized bile ducts, with subsequent destruction, cholestasis, fibrosis and, ultimately, hepatic cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>). Most primary biliary cirrhosis patients have increased class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) histocompatibility antigen expression on bile duct cells (<LINK REF="REF-Ballardini-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballardini 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Oord-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Oord 1986</LINK>), and cytotoxic T-cells, specific for the non-glutathionated PDC-E2 epitope of the mitochondria, are infiltrating the bile duct epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2005</LINK>). Other duct systems of the body with a high concentration of HLA class II antigens on their epithelium, such as the lacrimal and pancreatic glands, may be involved in the disease process (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have been subjected to many drugs. Ursodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid, is the most extensively used drug in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). However, we were unable to demonstrate any significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on mortality or liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>). Over the years, a number of other drugs have been used for primary biliary cirrhosis. Earlier attempts to treat primary biliary cirrhosis using immunomodulatory and other agents such as azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heathcote 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1985</LINK>), prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1992</LINK>), chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1986</LINK>), cyclosporine (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 1990</LINK>), D-penicillamine (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matloff-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matloff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 1985</LINK>), or colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vuoristo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vuoristo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1996</LINK>) did not lead to widespread acceptance of these drugs for primary biliary cirrhosis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a UK national survey of prescribing habits in primary biliary cirrhosis, 0.3% of gastroenterologists prescribed methotrexate to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist that blocks nucleic acid synthesis. Additionally, folic acid antagonists are potent inhibitors of cell-mediated (T and B cells) immune reactions and have been employed as immunosuppressive agents, for example, in allogeneic bone marrow and organ transplantation, and for treatment of dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Chu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feagan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 1995</LINK>). Low-dose methotrexate has immunosuppressive properties that may be mediated through inhibition of human interleukin-1 beta-induced leukocyte proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on small pilot studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergasa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergasa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1997</LINK>), methotrexate was initially suggested as monotherapy for primary biliary cirrhosis patients since the degree of hepatic inflammation and bile duct injury improved in some patients. The degree of liver fibrosis and histological stage, however, were not improved (<LINK REF="STD-Bergasa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergasa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1997</LINK>). One recent case series, based on a small number of patients, reports improvement in symptomatology in patients on methotrexate (<LINK REF="STD-Babatin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Babatin 2006</LINK>). The first placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate for primary biliary cirrhosis did not support clinical use of low-dose methotrexate (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK>). The addition of methotrexate did not seem to confer additional benefit in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Steenbergen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Van Steenbergen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK>). We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews assessing the effects of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, other than the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005</LINK>). here it seemed that methotrexate significantly increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Trials with 'low risk of bias' were considered those trials that were assessed as trials having 'low risk of bias' in all of the specified above individual domains. Trials with 'uncertain risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' were considered those trials that were assessed as trials having 'uncertain risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the specified individual domains. The difference between the estimates of two subgroups was estimated according to <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>We used the statistical package Review Manager 5 provided by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). Regarding the time-to-event data, like death, for example, we extracted the hazard ratios (HR) from the trials (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>) and pooled them by generic inverse variance. We presented dichotomous data as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous outcome measures by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>We examined intervention effects by using both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>) with the significant level set at P &lt; 0.05. If the results of the two analyses led to the same conclusion, we presented only the results of the fixed-effect model analysis. In case of discrepancies of the two models, we reported the results of both models. We explored the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi-squared test with significance set at P &lt; 0.10 and measured the quantities of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2 </SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>)<SUP> </SUP>.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
</P>
<P>We planned to perform the following comparisons whenever possible:<BR/>1. Methotrexate versus placebo or no intervention.<BR/>2. Methotrexate with co-intervention versus placebo or no intervention with co-intervention (combination therapy).<BR/>3. Methotrexate versus another intervention.<BR/>We planned to combine subgroups one and two together, and to perform the third analysis as a separate meta-analysis. We planned to compare the interaction effect in comparison 1 and comparison 2, in order to examine the potential interaction between the drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses<BR/>
</B>Regarding the primary outcome measure, that is, mortality, we included patients with incomplete or missing data in the sensitivity analyses by imputing them into following scenarios (the last four being intention-to-treat analyses) (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>):<BR/>1. Available patient analysis: data on only those whose results are known, using as denominator the total number of patients who completed the trial;<BR/>2. Assuming poor outcome: dropouts from both the methotrexate and control groups had the primary outcomes;<BR/>3. Assuming good outcome: none of the dropouts from the methotrexate and control groups had the primary outcomes;<BR/>4. Extreme case favouring methotrexate: none of the dropouts from the methotrexate-group but the dropouts from the control group had the primary outcomes;<BR/>5. Extreme case favouring control: all dropouts from the methotrexate-group but none from the control group had the primary outcomes.<BR/>For secondary outcomes, we adopted 'available patient analysis'. Therefore, in the review, the number of patients in the denominator changed according to the secondary outcomes investigated.</P>
<P>
<B>Bias exploration<BR/>
</B>Funnel plot was used to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates were associated with study size. The performance of the available methods of detecting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) vary with the magnitude of the treatment effect, the distribution of study size, and whether a one- or two-tailed test is used (<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>). Therefore, we intended to use the most appropriate method having good trade-off in the sensitivity and specificity, based on characteristics of the trials included in this review.</P>

We excluded 545 duplicates or clearly irrelevant references through reading abstracts. Accordingly, 29 references were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, we excluded 17 because they were non-randomised trials, reviews, or observational studies. They are listed under 'Characteristics of excluded studies' with the reasons for exclusion. Twelve references were subsequently considered, and seven of them were already included in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005</LINK>).

<P>The mean age of patients in the included trials was 53 years, and 96% of the patients were females. In the three trials, which reported liver histological stage at entry, about half of the patients had liver histological stage I/II and half had stage III/IV. The entry criteria varied across the trials but were generally well-defined, making it highly likely that all patients had primary biliary cirrhosis. The dosage of methotrexate differed, that is, 7.5 mg/week, 10 mg/week, 15 mg/week, and 15 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> body surface (maximal dose 20 mg/week). The duration of methotrexate treatment varied from 48 weeks to 10 years, and the median duration was six years.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2004</LINK> et al compared methotrexate versus colchicine for two years. They observed that 11/42 patients died or underwent liver transplantation in the methotrexate group versus 9/43 patients in the colchicine group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.71) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The pruritus score was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate than those receiving colchicine (MD - 0.68, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.25) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Regarding liver biochemical outcomes, the activity of s-alkaline phosphatases and the concentration of plasma immunoglobulin M were significantly lower in the methotrexate group than in the colchicine group (MD - 0.41 U/l, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.12 and MD -0.47 ng/ml, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>).

<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analyses and compared methotrexate alone versus placebo alone, and methotrexate+ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo+ursodeoxycholic acid or no intervention+ursodeoxycholic acid. The <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK> trial showed a statistical difference in mortality favouring placebo (RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.19 to 20.92 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1), but the wide confidence interval warrants caution in this case, and the pooled risk ratios did not show a statistical difference when <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Combes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Combes 2005</LINK> trials were included in the analysis.

<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses</B>
</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome measure, that is, mortality, to evaluate the effect of dropouts from studies on the pooled effect estimate. We performed the following analyses:</P>
<P>1) Assuming poor outcome: dropouts from both the methotrexate and control groups had the primary outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). The analysis showed no significant difference in risk ratio between methotrexate and placebo (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33).<BR/>2) Assuming good outcome: none of the dropouts from the methotrexate and control groups had the primary outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). The analysis showed no significant difference in risk ratio between methotrexate and placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.77).<BR/>3) Extreme case favouring methotrexate: none of the dropouts from the methotrexate group but all the dropouts from the control group had the primary outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). The analysis showed a significant difference favouring methotrexate (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47).4. Extreme case favouring placebo: all of the dropouts from the methotrexate group but none of the dropouts from the control group had the primary outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>). The analysis showed a significant difference favouring placebo (RR 4.52, 95% CI 2.58 to 7.92).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK> trial showed a significant difference in mortality favouring placebo in all sensitivity analyses, but this result must be taken with caution because of wide confidence intervals and because there were no dropouts in the control group, and only one dropout in the methotrexate group. The other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Combes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Combes 2005</LINK>) did not show a significant difference in mortality in <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK> (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.13) and <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK> (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26 to1.62). In the sensitivity analysis evaluating extreme case favouring methotrexate, <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>, both <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Combes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Combes 2005</LINK> trials showed a significant difference favouring methotrexate (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.25), and when pooled with the <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK> trial the significant difference remained favouring methotrexate (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47). The heterogeneity was substantial (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 95%); therefore this result should be taken with a high degree of caution. In the sensitivity analysis evaluating extreme case favouring placebo, <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>, both <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Combes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Combes 2005</LINK> trials showed a significant difference favouring placebo (RR 4.43, 95% CI 2.41 to 8.15), and pooled data from all included trials supported this significant difference (RR 4.52, 95% CI 2.58 to 7.92).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-08 19:56:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Evidence shows that methotrexate compared with placebo has no significant effect on mortality or liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Furthermore, it shows no significant positive effect on biochemical markers. There is an apparent significantly positive effect on pruritus score. However, this cannot justify its use in clinical practice, as our data show that there are adverse events that need to be considered. We advise that any new randomised trials with methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis monitor harmful effects closely and that methotrexate should not be used outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
<P>We identified only one trial studying methotrexate versus colchicine. We observed no significant differences between the two interventions, apart from less pruritus in the methotrexate group. These results are difficult to interpret as we have no firm knowledge about the effects of colchicine in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our systematic review has several limitations. Only four trials involving 370 patients with 30 deaths were analysed on methotrexate versus placebo, or no intervention. This is a low number of patients and outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). None of the trials reported a sample size estimation. The risk of bias of the four placebo trials was generally high, which may significantly overestimate intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). If the same overestimation is valid for the present sample of trials, the prospects for methotrexate for primary biliary cirrhosis are even worse than our results may indicate. On the other hand, we cannot preclude that methotrexate may have beneficial effects in certain subgroups of patients. Furthermore, all but one of the trials had shorter follow-up than the estimated median survival of 10 to 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is difficult to detect a significant difference on mortality.</P>
<P>Methotrexate tended to increase the risk of mortality or liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Heterogeneity was considerable (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 82%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) across the two included trials for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Combes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Combes 2005</LINK>). The possible explanation for the heterogeneity could be the different follow-up periods (6 years and 10 years), or that methotrexate was given with or without co-intervention.</P>
<P>Methotrexate did not show any significant effect on fatigue or liver complications when compared with placebo. It showed a significant effect versus placebo in lowering the pruritus score; however, the number of patients that had an actual improvement (subjective decrease) in pruritus was not significant. When compared with colchicine (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2004</LINK>), methotrexate seemed to improve the severity of pruritus score (MD -0.68, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.25) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). This finding was from one trial with only 85 patients, and due to the large number of statistical comparisons having been performed, some of the comparisons might have come out with a significant difference simply due to the repetitive testing ('mass significance'). Therefore, this finding may need confirmation.</P>
<P>In a non-randomised study, <LINK REF="STD-Bergasa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergasa 1996</LINK> reported that methotrexate increased the number of patients with fibrosis. In another non-randomised study, <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1997</LINK> reported that methotrexate slowed the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. Based on the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK>), we did not observe any significant improvement in the liver histologic variables in the methotrexate group. For example, Knodell inflammatory score, Knodell fibrosis score, Ludwig stage, and bile duct/portal tract ratio, were not significantly different between the methotrexate and the placebo groups, neither after two years nor after four to six years follow-up.</P>
<P>The total dose in the <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK> trial was 10 mg/week, while in <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK> was 7.5 mg/week. Failure to show a beneficial effect of methotrexate on clinical, biochemical, or histologic evolution may point to insufficient dose of methotrexate. Since there was no death and/or liver transplantation in <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK>, it is impossible to do a subgroup analysis by dosage.</P>
<P>The analysis of adverse events showed substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). A six-year randomised clinical trial, applying methotrexate with 7.5 mg/week, observed a non-significant difference in adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1999</LINK>). However, in the <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Koch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Koch 1997</LINK> trial with the dosage of 10 mg/week and 48-week follow-up, 10/13 patients given methotrexate developed adverse events, while none of the twelve patients given placebo had adverse events. This contrast might be due to the toxicity of methotrexate appearing in the early stage of its administration while it becomes well-tolerated in selected patients during long-term treatment. It might also be because the two trials applied different definitions to adverse events. The <LINK REF="STD-Combes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Combes 2005</LINK> trial, which was carried out on a larger number of included patients and with longer follow-up, reports a non-significant difference in adverse events.</P>
<P>We evaluated the safety issue of adverse events in the relevant non-randomised studies and observational studies. We found that interstitial pneumonitis, aphthous ulcers, transient abdominal discomfort, minor dyspeptic symptoms, and mucositis and bone marrow depression were the most frequent adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>). In our sample of included trials, we could not rule out the hepatotoxicity of methotrexate because of the liver cirrhosis related nature of primary biliary cirrhosis and its reflection on the tendency of decreased survival or liver transplantation. Four Cochrane reviews have examined the hepatotoxic effect of methotrexate in patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2009</LINK>), rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Suarez_x002d_Almazor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suarez-Almazor 2009</LINK>), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Takken-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takken 2009</LINK>), and Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Alfadhli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfadhli 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, a narrative review on patients with psoriasis has also explored the hepatotoxicity of methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 1996</LINK>). Hepatotoxicity was a common adverse effect with methotrexate (8 trials using 15 mg/week, 1 using 30 mg/week) compared with placebo in adults with asthma (RR 6.61, 95% CI 2.36 to 18.53, nine trials) (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2009</LINK>). The most common cause for discontinuation of methotrexate (7.5 to 15 mg/week) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was the presence of liver enzyme abnormalities (RR 4.45, 95% CI 1.57 to 12.66, five trials) (<LINK REF="REF-Suarez_x002d_Almazor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suarez-Almazor 2009</LINK>). The RR for overall withdrawals from methotrexate therapy (10 to15 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>/week) for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis was 1.60 (95% CI 0.66 to 3.87, two trials) compared with placebo, suggesting there is no difference between methotrexate and placebo in terms of harmful effects. However, the type of adverse events was not specified (<LINK REF="REF-Takken-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takken 2009</LINK>). The adverse events in methotrexate patients (12.5 mg, 22.5 mg, 25 mg per week) with refractory Crohn's disease were significantly more common than with placebo (RR 6.97, 95% 1.61 to 30.10, three trials) (<LINK REF="REF-Alfadhli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfadhli 2009</LINK>). The most common reasons for withdrawal were nausea and vomiting, and asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes. The evidence is sufficiently strong to support that in psoriatic patients, low-dose methotrexate may be hepatotoxic, eventually leading to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 1996</LINK>). More information is needed about the methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. If the problem is limited to an increase of biological parameters that disappear when the drug is stopped, it may be manageable, but if there is clinical complications related to the hepatotoxicity or major histological lesion, the issue is different.</P>

<P>Although the majority of the evidence did not point to a beneficial effect of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, we are not able to exclude the possibility for a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. It is noteworthy, and therefore possibly a matter for research, that methotrexate has a possible beneficial effect in control of symptoms in primary biliary cirrhosis (ie, pruritus score). We advise that any new randomised, placebo-controlled trial with methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis should monitor harmful events closely.</P>
