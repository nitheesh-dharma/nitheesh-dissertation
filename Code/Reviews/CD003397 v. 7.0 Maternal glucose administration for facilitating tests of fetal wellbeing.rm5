<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-20 14:43:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>There is no evidence that antenatal maternal glucose administration make tests of fetal wellbeing more effective.</P>
<P>Tests on unborn babies such as ultrasound and heart rate testing are carried out to check their wellbeing. As a baby's sleep periods can alter those results, various methods are used to wake the baby. Antenatal maternal glucose administration is one of the methods. The review of two trials, involving 708 participants, did not find this method to be effective. Research on antenatal maternal glucose administration should take into consideration that there have not been any benefits demonstrated as yet.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antenatal maternal glucose administration has been suggested to improve the efficiency of antepartum fetal heart rate testing. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:20:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various methods of stimulation have been proposed to arouse the fetus from the quiet sleep phase of the rest-activity cycle. They include a change in maternal position, physical activity, maternal glucose ingestion, acoustic stimulation, stimulation with light and manual manipulation of the fetus. If the fetus can be aroused effectively, such stimulations may be useful when used in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing.</P>
<P>A number of studies have reported an increase in fetal activity related to increased serum levels of maternal glucose following glucose administration (<LINK REF="REF-Adadjem-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adadjem 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gelman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gelman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1978</LINK>). Arousing the fetus by administering glucose to the mother (either orally or intravenously) could be useful in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. In particular the time needed to obtain a normal reactive cardiotocograph might be decreased and the number of false positive non-reactive antepartum fetal heart tracings might be lowered.</P>

<P>The objectives are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>to evaluate the effects of antenatal maternal glucose administration (oral glucose ingestion or intravenous glucose) used in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. In particular to assess whether the adjunctive use of glucose administration to alter fetal behavioural states leads to fewer false positive non-reactive tests.</LI>
<LI>to assess whether the adjunctive administration of glucose affects: perinatal outcome, maternal satisfaction, time required to complete the test, and cost savings.</LI>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Only two trials were identified from the search strategy which satisfactorily addressed the effect of glucose ingestion on the incidence of non-reactive cardiotocography (<LINK REF="STD-Eglinton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eglinton 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1983</LINK>). Reactivity was defined as two or more accelerations (<LINK REF="STD-Eglinton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eglinton 1984</LINK>) or four or more accelerations (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1983</LINK>) of at least 15 beats per minute which lasted at least 15 seconds in a 20 minute interval. Patients in the experimental group received an eight ounce preparation of reconstituted orange juice (20 gm of carbohydrate) in Eglinton's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eglinton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eglinton 1984</LINK>) and 50 grams of oral glucose drink in Richardson's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1983</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Eglinton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eglinton 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1983</LINK> trials, were single blinded studies where the workers who performed the analysis of the cardiotocography did not know whether the patients had received glucose. There was no withdrawal from the two trials after randomization.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:17:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The benefits of antenatal maternal glucose administration, if any, in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing must be weighed against its effect on the predictive reliability of the tests and the safety of the procedure.</P>
<P>There is a paucity in the literature of randomized controlled trials relating to antenatal maternal glucose administration in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. There is currently insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials upon which to base a recommendation regarding the use of antenatal maternal glucose administration.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current evidence suggests that there is unlikely to be a clinical role for maternal glucose administration in reducing the incidence of non-reactive cardiotocography. The benefits of the adjunctive use of glucose ingestion with respect to perinatal outcome also remain to be established.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further clinical trials on its use in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing and its effect on perinatal outcome are needed. However research on antenatal maternal glucose administration should take into consideration that there have not been any clinical benefits demonstrated as yet. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. We will enter data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) and check for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</P>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.  We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.  Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomization);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by 1 to 5 above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.  We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Dichotomous data</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.<I> </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Continuous data</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. <B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors<I> </I>using the methods described in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T<SUP>2</SUP>, I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if I<SUP>2</SUP> is greater than 30% and either T<SUP>2</SUP> is greater than zero, or there is a low P-value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
