<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Peripheral neuropathies are a wide range of diseases (both genetic and acquired) affecting the peripheral nerves. Symptoms can include pain, altered sensation such as tingling or numbness, muscle weakness and fatigue. Exercise therapy, with a view to improving strength and stamina, forms part of many rehabilitation programmes after a peripheral neuropathy. This review found inadequate evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effect of exercise in disability in peripheral neuropathy. There was evidence that strengthening exercises moderately improve muscle strength in people with a peripheral neuropathy.<BR/>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:37:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Peripheral neuropathies are a wide range of diseases affecting the peripheral nerves. Demyelination or axonal degeneration gives rise to a variety of symptoms including reduced or altered sensation, pain, muscle weakness and fatigue. Secondary disability arises and this may result in adjustments to psychological and social function. Exercise therapy, with a view to developing strength and stamina, forms part of the treatment for people with peripheral neuropathy, particularly in the later stages of recovery from acute neuropathy and in chronic neuropathies. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to examine the effect of exercise therapy on functional ability in the treatment of people with peripheral neuropathy. In addition, secondary outcomes of muscle strength, endurance, broader measures of health and well being, as well as unfavourable outcomes were examined. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:37:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In September 2009 we updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register, MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), CINAHL (from January 1982) and LILACS (from January 1982). Bibliographies of all selected randomised controlled trials were checked and authors contacted to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-04-07 20:18:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trial in people with peripheral neuropathy comparing the effect of exercise therapy with no exercise therapy or drugs or an alternative non-drug treatment on functional ability (or disability) for at least eight weeks after randomisation was included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently selected eligible studies, rated the methodological quality and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one trial fully met the inclusion criteria. An additional two trials assessed outcomes less than eight weeks after randomisation and were also included. Methodological quality was poor for several criteria in each study. Data used in the three studies could not be pooled due to heterogeneity of diagnostic groups and outcome measures. The results of the included trials failed to show any effect of strengthening and endurance exercise programmes on functional ability in people with peripheral neuropathy. However, there is some evidence that strengthening exercise programmes were moderately effective in increasing the strength of tested muscles.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of exercise on functional ability in people with peripheral neuropathy. The results suggest that progressive resisted exercise may improve muscle strength in affected muscles. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-11 11:55:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-20 12:41:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Peripheral nerves connect the sensory receptors and muscles to the central nervous system. Peripheral nerves are subject to a very wide range of diseases called peripheral neuropathies that collectively affect about 2.4% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Martyn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martyn 1998</LINK>). The peripheral neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which one or all of the elements of the peripheral nervous system are damaged, primarily affecting either the myelin (the nerve insulating sheath), the axon (the central nerve fibre), or a mixture of the two. Damage to the myelin sheath, or demyelination, produces dysfunction which may be quite rapidly reversed in a matter of weeks as the myelin regenerates. Damage to the nerve axon is repaired by regeneration or sprouting from the intact elements, which may take many months and recovery is often incomplete.</P>
<P>Patients with peripheral neuropathy typically develop symptoms of numbness, or altered sensation (e.g. pins and needles), starting at the extremities and progressing more proximally with advancing disease. Strength is affected when motor nerves are involved. Reduced or absent reflexes are a characteristic examination finding.</P>
<P>Peripheral neuropathies can be genetic or acquired. Some may be insidious in onset whilst others are acute. The natural history in any individual case of neuropathy is largely dependent upon the underlying cause. Acute neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, reach their worst and then slowly recover. Others, e.g. chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, tend to relapse and remit, whilst others gradually deteriorate over many years (e.g. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), alcohol-related neuropathy).</P>
<P>Symptoms during and residual problems after peripheral neuropathy include muscle weakness, pain, sensory deficits, increased fatigability (<LINK REF="REF-Merkies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkies 1999</LINK>), psychological dysfunction and difficulties with poor social adjustment (<LINK REF="REF-Lennon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfeiffer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfeiffer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padua-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padua 2008</LINK>). The extent of an individual's physical recovery is not necessarily related to recovery of nerve function (<LINK REF="REF-Molenaar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molenaar 1999</LINK>). As in other chronic neurological disorders, the extent to which individuals with similar residual deficits experience limitations in activity and how they perceive the impact of this on their daily lives varies (<LINK REF="REF-Lennon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholas 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rehabilitation for people after peripheral neuropathy has focused on symptomatic treatment and exercise therapy with little agreement in the literature regarding whether strengthening (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) or endurance (<LINK REF="REF-Pitetti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitetti 1993</LINK>) programmes are more effective (<LINK REF="REF-Herbison-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbison 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, several uncontrolled studies since the last update of this review, show that exercise interventions are associated with significant improvements in muscle strength, functional ability and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Chetlin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chetlin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garssen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garssen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2007</LINK>). Recent recommendations for exercise prescription for people with peripheral neuropathy include a combination of aerobic and functional exercises as well as strengthening exercises to target specific weak muscle groups (<LINK REF="REF-Chetlin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chetlin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Strengthening programmes typically involve progressive resisted exercise utilising repetitions of specific muscle contractions. These can be isometric (performed against maximal resistance where no associated joint movement is possible), isotonic (performed against a submaximal known resistance, this is typically greater than 70% of the maximal load possible, where joint movement and limb excursion is permitted) or isokinetic (performed against variable resistance but where the speed of contraction is constant). Endurance programmes typically involve gradually increasing the duration and intensity of aerobic activity for example cycling, running, or walking. Specific muscle endurance programmes may also involve the use of low load high repetition muscle contractions.</P>
<P>Patients are often unsure as to how much exercise they should undertake in both acute neuropathy, which is recovering, and chronic neuropathy, in which their exercise tolerance is reduced. They can be fearful that excessive exercise might exacerbate their symptoms. Indeed, in some patients where marked weakness is a feature, joints may be at a mechanical disadvantage and exercising may result in soft tissue damage.</P>
<P>There is some consensus that fatigue may be a common feature in people with peripheral neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Merkies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkies 1999</LINK>). The cardiorespiratory response to exercise testing has been shown to be reduced in people with CMT (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1995</LINK>) and subclinical deficits in aerobic capacity and/or muscular strength and endurance are revealed by army physical fitness testing (<LINK REF="REF-Burrows-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 1990</LINK>) in soldiers after recovery from GBS.</P>
<P>Since the previous update, two cohort studies of exercise for people with inflammatory neuropathy show that participants were stronger, fitter and experienced less fatigue after a 12 week exercise programme that included aerobic activity. The reduction in fatigue was also associated with an improvement in overall mood and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Garssen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garssen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2007</LINK>). The extent to which subjective feelings of fatigue are related to objective muscle fatigue is unclear. Thus graded exercise programmes such as those which have been shown to be effective in improving functional performance, and participation by people with chronic fatigue syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Fulcher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulcher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wearden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wearden 1998</LINK>) in RCTs may be appropriate.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that judicious timing of exercise therapy is necessary because evidence from animal studies suggests that increased neuromuscular activity during reinnervation may be detrimental. Whilst there is some evidence that intensive exercise carried out early in the reinnervation process is detrimental to nerve sprouting (<LINK REF="REF-Tam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2001</LINK>), the bulk of studies show either no effect (<LINK REF="REF-Gardiner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardiner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sebum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebum 1996</LINK>) or a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Einsiedel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Einsiedel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ribchester-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribchester 1988</LINK>) of exercise during reinnervation on the recovery of function.</P>
<P>Therefore it is important to examine critically the evidence surrounding the safety, type, timing and effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of people with peripheral neuropathy.<BR/>

(<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) recruited 34 patients with CMT disease: 21 subjects had type I, six had type II and in two subjects the type was unknown. Richardson (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) recruited 20 subjects with peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus. Ruhland and Shields (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) recruited 28 subjects with chronic peripheral neuropathy including 12 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), six with CIDP with monoclonal gammopathy, three with CIDP with central demyelination or possible toxic neuropathy, four with idiopathic axonal degeneration and three with hereditary peripheral neuropathy.</P>
<P>Two trials compared progressive resisted exercise with a non-intervention control (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). One of these included aerobic conditioning exercise alongside progressive resistance exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). The third trial compared progressive resisted exercise and balance exercises with a non-therapeutic exercise control (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>). The non-therapeutic exercises consisted of progressive resisted exercises of muscle groups in the upper limb that were considered unlikely to influence the selected focal lower limb outcome measures of unipedal stance, tandem stance, functional reach and the activities specific balance scale.</P>
<P>Electronic searches were updated prior to submission of the review and a further potentially relevant study, published only in abstract form, was identified from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register (<LINK REF="STD-Zifko-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zifko 2003</LINK>). The study is included in the studies awaiting assessment since the authors are currently seeking to publish the study in full. The information from the full publication will be included in the review as an update, once available.<BR/>

<P>Since blinding of patients and researchers is difficult in exercise trials, the trials are susceptible to bias including detection, performance and attrition bias. Even in the trial where participants were randomised into active exercising and control exercising groups, the very different nature of the exercises (upper versus lower limb) and the use of outcome measures reflecting lower limb function, could prevent true patient blinding to the intervention.</P>
<P>The methods of randomisation were unclear in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) and inadequate in the other two (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) due to matching of subjects in intervention and control groups. Allocation concealment was not described in any trial and in both trials where randomisation with matching was carried out, allocation concealment was not possible.</P>
<P>Only one of the three trials included explicit diagnostic criteria. Richardson (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) included patients with a known history of diabetes mellitus and lower extremity symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy. They also required conclusive electrodiagnostic evidence of diffuse, primarily axonal, peripheral polyneuropathy. In the second trial Lindeman (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) included patients diagnosed with CMT disease on the basis of their clinical picture, electromyography and nerve conduction studies but not genetic testing. However, no explicit details of diagnostic criteria were given. In the third trial the criteria were not explicitly stated and subjects were selected on the basis of their clinical diagnosis as recorded in a clinical database. Subjects were included if they had a clinical diagnosis of CIDP, chronic idiopathic axonal degeneration, CMT disease or toxic neuropathy as long as the toxin was no longer detectable through blood sampling (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). Duration, severity or degree of recovery from neuropathy was not indicated in any of the included trials and baseline comparisons of groups were made on the basis of other characteristics.</P>
<P>All trials considered differences in baseline characteristics, although this was based on different clinical characteristics in each case. There was no consistent examination of severity or duration of neuropathy. The first trial matched patients on muscle strength and stair-climbing performance and no obvious baseline differences in age or gender of patients was noted (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). The second trial, where group randomisation was performed, showed significant baseline differences in severity of neuropathy as indicated by the Michigan Diabetes Neuropathy Score (MDNS) (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>). Eight out of the 28 patients in the final trial were non-randomly placed into control and experimental groups to maintain similar baseline characteristics for age and gender (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). In this trial there were significant differences in the Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) for role limitation (emotional) and social function scale scores and despite non-randomised placement of patients, the mean age of patients in the intervention group (63.6 ± 10.5 years) was significantly higher than the control group (52.9 ± 16.2 years). However in this case baseline differences were accounted for by using these factors as co-variates in the subsequent data analysis.</P>
<P>In two trials the inclusion criteria included a minimum ambulatory capability of: "must be able to walk household distances without assistance or assistive device indoors" (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) and, "the ability to ambulate 4.6 m with or without assistance or assistive device'"(<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). In the third trial there was no such requirement but the baseline data included a stair climbing test, and a "qualification period" for recruited subjects was employed to exclude subjects with motivational problems (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). Thus, it appears that only ambulant patients were included in the reviewed studies.</P>
<P>Documentation of therapy input was adequate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). Clear descriptions of type, intensity and duration of exercise were given in both cases. In the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) the intensity and frequency of exercise was less in the control group than the intervention group exposing the trial to moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>Clear descriptions of outcome criteria were included in all trials. The authors initially planned that only trials where the outcome measures utilised validated measures of disability at least eight weeks after randomisation, would be selected. However this retrieved only one suitable study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). Under these circumstances it was decided to include those studies where suitable outcome measures had been utilised on completion of an exercise programme, even where the programme was less than eight weeks in duration. This alteration to the original protocol subsequently retrieved two further suitable studies (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). No included trial had disability as the primary outcome measure. In one case the primary outcome measure, the SF-36, was described as a measure of health related quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). Whilst it might be argued that this instrument includes some items relating to disability, its primary focus is on handicap (participation) and quality of life and it does not provide data which could be combined in any robust way with the commonly used standard measures of disability.</P>
<P>In one trial follow-up was complete for the intended follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) and an intention-to-treat analysis was possible. In the two other trials, follow-up was incomplete due to drop-outs. In the case of (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) one control patient was unable to undertake the final 24 week follow-up strength assessments, due to knee problems. There was no attempt to replace data for intention to treat analyses and the matched pair to which the control patient belonged was removed from the analysis. In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) one intervention and three control patients dropped out during the course of the trial. The intervention patient dropped out due to exercises aggravating an underlying arthritic condition, two control patients dropped out giving no reason and the final control patient developed an unrelated illness, preventing completion of the trial. Follow-up was not extended beyond the length of the intervention period in any of the included trials. The intervention periods varied as follows: three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>), six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) and 24 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the trials fulfilled all of the criteria for methodological quality and all three trials failed to reach adequate methodological quality in a number of items. The scores for each trial for the risk of bias are summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. In addition the criterion for patient blinding was waived in the case of exercise versus non-exercise trials.</P>

<P>The primary included trial showed a significant reduction in the time taken for a six metre walk (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) at 24 weeks after starting the exercise with a MD of 0.7 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). No other significant improvements in time scored functional activities were observed. There were no data available for the stated apparent improvement in aspects of upper-leg strength related functional activities of the modified Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) used in this study. One of the two secondary included trials, used the SF-36 to assess what the authors stated to be health related quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). However the SF-36 scale, in addition to the majority of items pertaining to an individuals level of participation, also contains items pertaining to physical functioning. These items assess functional ability and could therefore more readily be interpreted as relating to activity limitation. However, no within or between group differences were found for the physical function scale. Unfortunately, no standard deviations were presented in the text of this study so no overall effect size can be calculated. In the final trial there were no significant changes in the chosen disability outcome measure, the Activities Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale score (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) at three weeks after randomisation, MD 8.00 (95% CI -8.47 to 24.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The follow-up duration was different in each trial. In the primary included trial, follow-up was at eight weekly intervals for 24 weeks. However, in the secondary included trials the follow-up period was less than the stated eight weeks recommended by the review protocol. Since, in these trials the duration of the exercise intervention was also less than eight weeks, in one only three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) and in the other only six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>), shorter follow-up periods were permitted.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-07 20:18:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The main finding of the review is that there is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to confidently evaluate the effect of exercise on functional ability in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Only one trial examining the effect of exercise in 34 patients with CMT met the full inclusion criteria and was initially included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). Subsequently, a further two trials that met all criteria except for the need for studies to examine follow-up at least eight weeks after commencement of the intervention or control period, were also included (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). All three trials were small with only 82 patients examined in total. The authors acknowledge that blinding of patients and to a lesser extent observers is difficult in exercise therapy trials. If blinding is carried out, it generally remains at least at risk of exposure and hence bias, and therefore these criteria for methodological quality are difficult to satisfy. Nevertheless, the included trials failed to meet several of our other criteria for methodological quality and this inevitably limits the certainty with which any conclusions may be viewed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interpreting the findings from included trials</HEADING>
<P>The cause of neuropathy was different in each trial (metabolic, CMT disease, CIDP) and mixed causes were evident in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). The severity of disease and the duration since onset was not adequately documented in the three trials. However, inclusion and exclusion criteria based on functional mobility may have reduced variability of these factors in the reviewed trials. Nevertheless, the response to exercise in patients with different types, severity and/or duration of peripheral neuropathy may be different and therefore reduce the validity and generalisability of findings.<BR/>
<BR/>Whilst all trials included exercises to improve muscle strength, the intensity of exercise was variable and the muscle groups strengthened were different across the three trials. Only <LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK> utilised a standardised method of determining load for exercise intensity. <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK> used progressive strengthening exercises determined by the subjects ease of completion and the final study (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) used a fixed load with increased repetitions during the intervention period. Both studies using progressive resistance (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) demonstrated some significant improvements in muscle strength over the period of the intervention.</P>
<P>The effect of exercise on cardiovascular fitness was not evaluated in any of the included trials, despite the inclusion of 20 minutes of aerobic cycling in the training programme for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). This is an unfortunate omission since the evidence from RCTs for the benefits of regular exercise on improving cardiovascular fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Lemura-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemura 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McArdle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 1996</LINK>), mood and mental well-being in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-McAuley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAuley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moses-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moses 1989</LINK>) and in patients with neuromuscular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Cedraschi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cedraschi 2004</LINK>) is growing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reporting of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>A lack of consensus in reporting of outcome measures was evident in the review. Whilst all trials used between one and five time scored functional activities to assess functional ability no single activity was the same across trials. Two trials used additional measures, namely, subscales of the SF-36 (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) or a modification of the functional component of the WOMAC (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) to assess functional ability. However, it could be argued that neither of these measures unequivocally evaluates functional ability since they include questions to evaluate the impact of deficits in functional ability on general functioning or societal participation. No significant changes in the composite measures were demonstrated. Indeed, only an improvement in the six metre comfortable walking speed at 24 weeks after starting the exercise programme was demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>.This suggests that exercise may have a limited effect on functional ability, at least in the reviewed trials. However, the authors suggested that this small change in preferred six metre gait speed may be influenced by motivation since the subjects were not blinded for intervention allocation. It is also important to note that the intervention period in two of the trials was less than the eight weeks initially identified by the review protocol. It could be that in these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) the exercise was not continued for long enough. Indeed, Lindeman et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) did not report improvements in any of the measures of functional ability at either of the earlier time points for assessing outcome (eight and 16 weeks after starting exercising).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Of the stated secondary outcomes, muscle strength, endurance and quality of life were evaluated in some of the included trials. The only beneficial effects of exercise presented were small but significant changes in muscle force which were demonstrated in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>) with the greatest improvement in strength observed where the methods for determining load for progressive resisted exercise was clearly described and standardised (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). The authors claim that this change in muscle strength represents only a moderate improvement in response to strengthening exercise compared with healthy people (<LINK REF="REF-Hakkinen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakkinen 1985</LINK>). However the response to strengthening exercise varies due to the type, intensity and duration of exercise and the percentage change in strength of leg extensors in this study is comparable with more recent studies of similar interventions in patient populations and healthy exercising controls (<LINK REF="REF-Hakkinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakkinen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valkeinen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valkeinen 2004</LINK>). Interestingly, it is well recognised that whilst there are early increases in muscle strength due to training (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1985</LINK>) these are largely due to improved neural effectiveness and changes to muscle structure take longer to establish (<LINK REF="REF-Moritani-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moritani 1979</LINK>).Thus improvements in muscle strength may not be sufficient in the shorter trials to have an impact on functional ability. The modest evidence from this review supports the view that progressive resisted exercise may be effective in improving muscle strength in people with peripheral neuropathy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects of exercise</HEADING>
<P>Only one participant who was undertaking exercise dropped out of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2001</LINK>) due to pain in the lower limb. This was attributed to the programme aggravating an underlying arthritic condition. No other adverse events were documented. This is an important finding for two reasons. Firstly, it should be noted that in peripheral neuropathy, where motor and/or sensory signs and symptoms are present, altered joint mechanics and muscle imbalance may predispose patients to soft tissue injury during exercise. The included trials did not discuss this or the use of orthotic support to protect affected joints during exercise. Secondly, controversy exists regarding the use of strengthening exercises in conditions where partial denervation and reinnervation may be a feature. The possibility of overwork leading to an increase in neurological signs and symptoms has been investigated in both animal and human studies. Recent evidence from animal studies suggests that during the early reinnervation phase after partial denervation high levels of neuromuscular activity as a result of electrical stimulation or exercise prevents axonal sprouting and increases motor unit loss (<LINK REF="REF-Tam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2001</LINK>). However in people with post-poliomyelitis where enlarged motor units are compensating for progressive axonal loss due to partial denervation, moderate intensity exercise was effective in increasing muscle strength with no deleterious effects on motor unit number (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2003</LINK>). Therefore the limited evidence available from this review and others evaluating the effect of exercise in people with similar problems such as in fibromyalgia syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Busch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busch 2004</LINK>) and physical disability in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Latham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latham 2004</LINK>) suggests that exercise programmes aimed at strengthening muscles are feasible in people with peripheral neuropathy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>The search strategy of the review identified 481 citations, of which only one trial fulfilled all the selection criteria and a further two trials met all but one of the criteria. This highlights the paucity of trials and evidence in this important area of investigation. Several factors regarding the patient group and type of intervention may be responsible for this. Firstly, despite the relatively high prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the population (<LINK REF="REF-Martyn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martyn 1998</LINK>) the varied diagnostic types and severity of disease makes recruitment to trials of large numbers of sufficiently similar participants difficult. Secondly, the willingness of participants to be randomly allocated into either an exercise or non-intervention control group is particularly important for exercise trials where the motivation and commitment of the individual participants to undertake the exercise component may deter them from agreeing to participate. Finally, the current clinical provision for patients with peripheral neuropathy is likely to be predominantly by individualised rehabilitation that may include prescription of exercise in response to patients symptoms and individual needs. In addition many people with stable or chronic peripheral neuropathy may not be in receipt of treatment for their symptoms. This means that accurate description of exercise therapy in clinical trials is not always documented. This final point is important since the continued lack of high quality evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise in the treatment of people with peripheral neuropathy may influence the availability, accessibility and quality of service provision for this client group. Medical charities (<LINK REF="REF-NAlliance-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAlliance 2002</LINK>) and others (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2004</LINK>) have identified the needs of people with neurological and/or chronic conditions and service provision is a major concern. No true assessment of the cost and benefits of exercise in the treatment of people with peripheral neuropathy can be made until relevant research evidence is available, including the effect of exercise treatment on the overall economic burden of care to health service providers.</P>
<P>Overall the results of the included trials did not show that strengthening and endurance exercise programmes improve functional ability or reduce disability in patients with peripheral neuropathy. However, there was limited evidence that strengthening exercise programmes were effective in increasing the strength of tested muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhland 1997</LINK>). There was no impact on the level of disability in these patients but this may be related to the duration of the exercise intervention and methodological quality of included trials.</P>

<P>Whilst two authors were independently involved in checking titles and abstracts identified by the search, in assessing potentially relevant studies for inclusion and in evaluating the methodological quality of included studies, disagreements regarding inclusion criteria and quality were resolved by discussion and it was not deemed necessary to refer these to a third author. In addition whilst a standardised data extraction sheet was devised by two authors (CMW, JP) no wider consultation of experts in the field, regarding the content of the data extraction form was carried out. It is possible that these omissions may have introduced some personal bias in interpretation of the studies for inclusion in the review.<BR/>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-07 20:18:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-04-07 20:18:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There is little evidence from the presented RCTs to evaluate the effect of exercise on functional ability in peripheral neuropathy. The included trials failed to meet some of the selected criteria for risk of bias and the outcome measures used were too varied for accurate comparisons. However, there is some evidence that strengthening exercises moderately improve muscle strength in tested muscles. </P>
<P>No further RCTs were identified in the current update thus, clinical guidelines must remain based largely on evidence from uncontrolled trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The lack of high quality evidence with which to evaluate the effect of exercise on functional ability in people with peripheral neuropathy strongly supports the need to develop future high quality sufficiently powered trials. Future research designs should consider compatible diagnostic groups and include adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor, clear description of exercise intervention and standardization of outcome measures. </P>

<CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST>
<P>Two of the authors (CW, LTS) have been involved in a pilot study examining the effects of exercise on disability in peripheral neuropathy. The aims of the study are i) to determine the suitability and sensitivity of outcome measures, ii) to identify the most appropriate exercise programme and iii) to provide data for appropriate power calculations, for a subsequent randomised controlled trial.</P>
</CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST>
<CONTRIBUTIONS>
<P>CW developed and wrote the first draft of the protocol and incorporated comments from JP and LTS and Cochrane peer reviewers into the final version.</P>
