<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-18 14:19:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> To determine the relative benefits and harms associated with treatment consisting of drugs that suppress inflammation, called corticosteroids, given after the first week after birth to prevent or treat lung injury, known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sometimes also called chronic lung disease), in babies born too early.</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Corticosteroids can reduce lung inflammation in newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia but may cause major adverse effects. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major problem for newborn babies in neonatal intensive care units. It is associated with both a higher death rate and worse long-term outcomes among survivors. Persistent inflammation of the lungs is the most likely cause of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Corticosteroid drugs have strong anti-inflammatory effects and so have been used to prevent or to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia, particularly in babies who cannot be weaned from assisted ventilation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>We reviewed all clinical trials in preterm babies that gave corticosteroids after the first week after birth and provided data on rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia later in the newborn period.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> This review of trials indicates that giving corticosteroids to infants at least seven days after birth produces short-term benefits in reducing the need for assisted ventilation and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, perhaps also reducing death during the first 28 days of life. However, high doses in particular are associated with short-term side effects such as bleeding from the stomach or bowel, higher blood pressure, and difficulty tolerating glucose. In contrast with early use of corticosteroids (in the first week of life), we found little evidence of long-term complications and uncertainty regarding long-term problems. It seems wise to limit late use of corticosteroids to babies who cannot be weaned from assisted ventilation, and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence:</B> Overall the quality of evidence supporting our conclusions was high.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-16 05:16:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many preterm infants who survive go on to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, probably as the result of persistent inflammation in the lungs. Corticosteroids have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and have been used to treat individuals with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-16 05:23:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2017 update, we used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1); MEDLINE via PubMed (January 2013 to 21 February 2017); Embase (January 2013 to 21 February 2017); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; January 2013 to 21 February 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials<B>.</B>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-10-16 05:26:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected for inclusion in this review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic postnatal corticosteroid treatment versus placebo or nothing initiated more than seven days after birth for preterm infants with evolving or established bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-10-16 05:26:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.</P>
<P>We extracted and analysed data regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, failure to extubate, complications during primary hospitalisation, and long-term health outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-19 15:28:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-one RCTs enrolling a total of 1424 participants were eligible for this review. All were RCTs, but methods used for random allocation were not always clear. Allocation concealment, blinding of the intervention, and blinding of outcome assessments most often were satisfactory. Late steroid treatment was associated with a reduction in neonatal mortality (at 28 days) but no reduction in mortality at 36 weeks, at discharge, or at latest reported age. Benefits of delayed steroid treatment included reductions in failure to extubate by 3, 7, or 28 days; bronchopulmonary dysplasia both at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; need for late rescue treatment with dexamethasone; discharge on home oxygen; and death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia both at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Data revealed a trend towards increased risk of infection and gastrointestinal bleeding but no increase in risk of necrotising enterocolitis. Short-term adverse affects included hyperglycaemia, glycosuria, and hypertension. Investigators reported an increase in severe retinopathy of prematurity but no significant increase in blindness. Trial results showed a trend towards reduction in severe intraventricular haemorrhage, but only five studies enrolling 247 infants reported this outcome. Trends towards an increase in cerebral palsy or abnormal neurological examination findings were partly offset by a trend in the opposite direction involving death before late follow-up. The combined rate of death or cerebral palsy was not significantly different between steroid and control groups. Major neurosensory disability and the combined rate of death or major neurosensory disability were not significantly different between steroid and control groups. There were no substantial differences between groups for other outcomes in later childhood, including respiratory health or function, blood pressure, or growth, although there were fewer participants with a clinically important reduction in forced expired volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) on respiratory function testing in the dexamethasone group.</P>
<P>GRADE findings were high for all major outcomes considered, but review authors degraded the quality of evidence by one level because we found evidence of publication bias (bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-18 08:05:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benefits of late corticosteroid therapy may not outweigh actual or potential adverse effects. This review of postnatal systemic corticosteroid treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia initiated after seven days of age suggests that late therapy may reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increasing the risk of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the methodological quality of studies determining long-term outcomes is limited in some cases (some studies assessed surviving children only before school age, when some important neurological outcomes cannot be determined with certainty), and no studies were sufficiently powered to detect increased rates of important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Evidence showing both benefits and harms of treatment and limitations of available evidence suggests that it may be prudent to reserve the use of late corticosteroids for infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation, and to minimise both dose and duration for any course of treatment.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-18 14:21:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surfactant therapy has improved outcomes for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome but has only modestly reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Egberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egberts 1997</LINK>). More infants with BPD are being cared for in neonatal units, and management of their condition is both time-consuming and costly. The term 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia' describes injury with maldevelopment of the lung that follows preterm birth and is a major problem in neonatal intensive care units. Persistent lung inflammation is the most likely underlying pathogenesis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-16 13:56:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postnatal corticosteroid treatment has been shown to have some acute effects on lung function in infants with established BPD, especially among those who are ventilator-dependent (<LINK REF="STD-CDTG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">CDTG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mammel-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mammel 1983</LINK>). Corticosteroids may be given parenterally or enterally. Investigators have expressed concern that the benefits of steroids might not outweigh their adverse effects, which include hypertension, hyperglycaemia, intestinal perforation, and extreme catabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1993</LINK>). Animal studies have also raised concerns about adverse effects on the central nervous system of corticosteroids given perinatally to immature offspring (<LINK REF="REF-Flagel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flagel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gramsbergen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gramsbergen 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Multiple published systematic reviews have examined the use of systemic postnatal corticosteroids in infants with or at risk of BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Arias_x002d_Camison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arias-Camison 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnow_x002d_Mordi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnow-Mordi 1999</LINK>). Other systematic reviews have addressed early versus late use of inhaled corticosteroids for preventing or treating BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Onland-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onland 2017a</LINK>, respectively), as well as use of systemic versus inhaled steroids for preventing or treating BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012b</LINK>, respectively).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: mortality, BPD (including BPD at 28 days of life, BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in survivors, late rescue with corticosteroids (among all infants and survivors), and need for home oxygen therapy), death or BPD (at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age), and long-term outcomes (including blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy, and major neurosensory disability).</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias. We used the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach yields an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence and assignment to one of four grades.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When we judged meta-analysis to be appropriate, we carried out the analysis using RevMan 5, supplied by Cochrane. We used the Mantel-Haenszel method for estimates of typical risk ratio and risk difference. We analysed continuous measures using the inverse variance method, and computed mean differences or standardised mean differences. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ariagno-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ariagno 1987</LINK> was updated with complete data provided by the investigators in September 2000. Investigators randomised 34 preterm infants of less than 1501 grams birth weight who were ventilator-dependent and were not weaning from mechanical ventilation at three weeks of age to parenteral dexamethasone or placebo groups. Treated babies received one of two regimens: a 10-day course of 1.0 mg/kg/d for four days and 0.5 mg/kg/d for six days, or a seven-day course of 1.0 mg/kg/d for three days followed by 0.5 mg/kg/d for four days. Researchers calculated total respiratory system compliance from a pneumotachometer and made airway pressure measurements during mechanical inflation before and after seven days of treatment. Outcomes included mortality, duration of ventilation and oxygen therapy, and complications of prematurity and treatment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Avery-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Avery 1985</LINK> enrolled 16 infants with birth weight less than 1500 grams, a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome, inability to be weaned from the ventilator after two weeks, and radiological evidence of stage II or III BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>). Researchers excluded babies if they had patent ductus arteriosus, congenital heart disease, sepsis, or pneumonia; had received intravenous lipids for at least 24 hours; and were over six weeks of age. To those randomised to receive dexamethasone, investigators gave 0.5 mg/kg/d intravenously in two divided doses for three days, followed by 0.3 mg/kg/d for a further three days, thereafter decreased by 10% of the current dose every three days until a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/d was reached.

A total of 287 infants who were oxygen-dependent and had been in a static or deteriorating condition over the preceding week were eligible for trial entry from around three weeks of age. Study authors excluded infants with major malformations and delayed trial entry to allow treatment of any intercurrent infection or heart failure. Infants did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of entry. Those allocated to the dexamethasone group received 0.6 mg/kg/d intravenously (or orally if there was no intravenous line) for one week. Trialists had the option to give a second tapering nine-day course (0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/kg/d for three days each) if, after initial improvement, relapse occurred.

They did not include infants with symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus, renal failure, or sepsis. To infants in the 42-day group, researchers administered dexamethasone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d for three days and 0.3 mg/kg/d for the next three days. They then reduced the dose by 10% every three days until a dose of 0.1 mg/kg was reached on day 34. After three days at this dose, trialists gave the drug on alternate days for one week and then stopped. Infants in the 18-day dexamethasone group received the same initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d for three days, but their dose was then decreased more rapidly by 50% every three days until a dose of 0.06 mg/kg was reached on day 10. After three days at this dose, study authors gave the drug on alternate days for one week and then stopped. For the remaining four treatment days, those infants received saline placebo. Infants in the control group received saline placebo for 42 days.

Exclusions were few and comprised only those with congenital anomalies likely to adversely affect long-term neurological outcomes. Trialists worked at 11 collaborating centres within Australia, New Zealand, and Canada and performed stratification by centre. They randomly allocated infants to twice-daily doses of a 10-day tapering course of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.15 mg/kg/d for three days, 0.10 mg/kg/d for three days, 0.05 mg/kg/d for two days, 0.02 mg/kg/d for two days; for a total of 0.89 mg/kg over 10 days) (n = 35 infants) or to an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline placebo (n = 35 infants). A repeat course of the same blinded drug was a therapeutic option for attending physicians. The dexamethasone preparation did not contain bisulphite preservative. Researchers based the sample size calculation for the original trial on detecting improvement in survival free of major neurosensory disability from 50% to 60%, with a two-sided type I error rate of 5% and 80% power, and required that a total of 814 infants be recruited. This study was stopped early at 70 infants, not only because less than 10% of the initial sample had been recruited after 2.5 years, making it unlikely that the total sample size of 814 would be achieved within a reasonable time, but also because the rate of recruitment had fallen, not increased, even though more centres had entered the study from the time of its inception.</P>

Infants had to show lack of improvement in ventilator dependency during the preceding five days. Infants in the treatment group received dexamethasone 0.50 mg/kg/d for three days, given as a single daily dose by nasogastric tube.

Entry was postponed if an infant had a central venous catheter, active infection, untreated patent ductus arteriosus, glucose intolerance, or major segmental pulmonary collapse. Trial entry was postponed for 11 infants, mainly because of suspected sepsis. Researchers randomly allocated infants to receive either dexamethasone or saline. They gave dexamethasone orally or intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg twice daily for the first week, 0.125 mg/kg twice daily for the second week, and 0.10 mg/kg daily for the third week, and performed twice-weekly cranial ultrasound scans on all infants and analysed them blindly after completion of the study.</P>

<P>Overall most studies had low risk of bias. All were RCTs, although the method of random allocation was not always clear. Allocation concealment applied to most studies. Blinding of investigators and others was achieved most often with use of placebo, usually saline solution. Follow-up reporting for short-term outcomes was most often complete but was more variable for long-term outcomes beyond discharge and later into childhood.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ariagno-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ariagno 1987</LINK> was a double-blind trial in which the pharmacist performed randomisation. Trialists provided outcomes for all enrolled infants. Follow-up consisted of the following: Investigators assessed surviving children at 12, 24, and 36 months of age, corrected for prematurity, in the High-Risk Follow-Up Clinic. Data included cerebral palsy and auditory status, but criteria were not defined. Personnel involved and blinding of assessors to treatment groups were unclear. The follow-up rate of survivors was 96% (23/24) (<LINK REF="REF-Ariagno-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ariagno 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Avery-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Avery 1985</LINK> paired and compared treatment and control infants for success in weaning. Investigators stratified infants at entry by weight into three categories: less than 1000 grams, 1000 grams to 1250 grams, and 1251 grams to 1500 grams. Within each weight group, equal numbers of treatment cards and control cards were placed into envelopes for random selection. The first treated infant and the first control infant within a given weight category made the first pair, and researchers considered in the sequential analysis only infants who were paired for weaning success. If both infants in a pair were successful or had treatment failure, the result was a tie and trialists discarded the pair. If one infant weaned and the other did not, trialists scored the untied pair as favouring treatment or control. The study was stopped when significance was reached from weaning from the ventilator in the sequential analysis of untied pairs. At that time, 16 infants had been studied and 14 had been matched to form seven pairs. Study authors reported no follow-up component.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Brozanski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brozanski 1995</LINK>, researchers achieved randomisation by using a random numbers table and stratified infants according to sex and birth weight (&lt; 1000 grams vs &gt; 999 grams). They reported treatment allocation on cards inside sequentially numbered envelopes that were kept in the pharmacy where randomisation took place. Investigators enrolled 88 infants but provided outcome data, apart from survival without supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, for only 78 infants. They withdrew 10 infants during the study because of pharmacy error (dexamethasone group two infants, placebo group one infant), parental choice (placebo group two infants), or attending physician request (dexamethasone group one infant, placebo group four infants). All five infants withdrawn from the study by the attending physician subsequently received an extended course of dexamethasone. Follow-up consisted of the following (<LINK REF="REF-Hofkosh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofkosh 1995</LINK>): Unknown observer(s) blinded to treatment group allocation saw survivors at 12 months of age, corrected for prematurity. The follow-up rate of survivors was 68% (44/65). Study authors did not specify criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Psychological assessment included the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID). Study authors provided no data on major disability.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CDTG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">CDTG 1991</LINK> assigned groups by telephone call to the Clinical Trial Service Unit in Oxford. Investigators stratified infants by clinical centre and by whether or not they were ventilator-dependent. After completion of the trial, clinicians could give open steroids if this was clinically indicated because of life-threatening deterioration. Researchers retained infants in the group to which they had been allocated for the purpose of analysis. They enrolled 287 infants in the trial; two were ineligible because of major malformations (Fallot's tetralogy, oesophageal atresia), leaving 285 infants included in the analysis. Follow-up consisted of the following (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1995</LINK>): Researchrs provided data on survivors at 36 months of age, not corrected for prematurity. Primary sources of data, obtained in the UK and Ireland, were healthcare provider visitors, who provided data on major neurosensory diagnoses or other chronic problems, and general practitioners, who provided data on health and hospitalisations. Parents completed questionnaires, including the Minnesota Child Development Inventory (CDI). Parents, healthcare visitors, and general practitioners (GPs) were unaware of treatment group allocation. In some countries, investigators sought data from paediatricians only (&lt; 10% cases). The follow-up rate of survivors was 94% (209/223). Trialists did not specify criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy or blindness, but they defined severe hearing loss (deafness) as hearing loss requiring either hearing aids or special schooling. Major disability comprised any types of non-ambulant cerebral palsy at three years of age, &lt; 50% of age level on the CDI, or predicted special schooling for sensory or other impairment. Further follow-up at 13 to 17 years of age consisted of the following (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005b</LINK>): Assessors who were blinded to treatment group allocation assessed surviving children from the 25 individual British and Irish study centres at 13 to 17 years of age. Families completed a questionnaire on functional status, diagnoses of potentially disabling conditions (visual or hearing impairment, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy), and the child's schooling. Study authors asked GPs to complete a questionnaire to report known functional problems, diagnoses, and hospital admissions. The paediatrician responsible for each child's care made the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. One of three research nurses blinded to the children's original treatment allocation visited surviving children at home. They administered a non-verbal reasoning test and the British Picture Vocabulary Scale and averaged these scores as a proxy for IQ. Investigators defined moderate disability as consisting of one or two of the following: IQ 2 to 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean, ambulatory cerebral palsy, hearing deficits corrected with hearing aids, impaired vision, or a behaviour disorder with a major impact on schooling. They defined severe disability as any of the following: IQ &gt; 3 SDs below the mean, wheelchair-dependent cerebral palsy, uncorrectable hearing loss, blindness (perception of light only), or three moderate disabilities. Respiratory function included spirometry to measure forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), forced vital capacity (FVC), the FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC ratio, and forced expired flow from 25% to 75% (FEF)<SUB>25%-75%</SUB>, and study authors expressed results as standardised scores (z-scores), as were growth measurements. They assessed other outcomes, but we did not include them in the review. These included data on types of schooling, teacher questionnaires on a child's ability, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The follow-up rate of survivors at 13 to 17 years was 77% (150/195), as shown in data from five severely disabled children at three years of age who were not contacted as teenagers.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1989</LINK>, investigators achieved randomisation by sequential assignment from a table of random numbers known only to a pharmacist who had no knowledge of the clinical status of infants. Study authors present outcome data for all 36 infants enrolled in the study. This trial included two experimental groups: one treated for 18 days, and another treated for 42 days, compared with a single control group. For these analyses, trialists combined treatment groups (n = 25) and compared data versus data derived from the control group (n = 11). Follow-up consisted of the following: A paediatrician and an occupational therapist saw survivors at 15 months of age, corrected for prematurity. Observers were blinded to treatment group allocation. The follow-up rate of survivors was 100% (23/23). Researchers specified criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy but did not specify criteria for blindness or deafness. Psychological assessment included the MDI and the Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) of the BSID. Major disability comprised any of the following: cerebral palsy or MDI or PDI &lt; 1 SD. Investigators later assessed survivors at four years of age and confirmed neurological status for all participants (Cummings 2002 (personal communication follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1989</LINK>)). Researchers provided further follow-up at 15 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2005</LINK>). Assessors were blinded to treatment group allocation. Outcomes included growth (body size converted to z-scores), general health, respiratory morbidity, and respiratory function testing. Trialists assessed cognition using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III). Teachers completed data on class repetition, performance, and behaviour. Pulmonary function testing included spirometry to measure FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC, and FEF<SUB>25%-75%</SUB>, along with measurement of lung volumes (total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV)) by nitrogen washout; study authors expressed results as % predicted for age, height, and sex. Trial authors reported the numbers of surviving children with ongoing respiratory symptoms of wheezing or congestion and interpreted these as a diagnosis of asthma for meta-analysis. They defined intact survival as a normal neurological examination, an IQ &gt; 70, and receiving education in a normal classroom. For the meta-analysis, investigators defined major neurological disability as any of an abnormal neurological examination (i.e. cerebral palsy), cognitive delay (IQ &lt; 71), or not in a regular classroom (with or without additional help). They did not measure blood pressure.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2006</LINK> was a double-blind trial with randomisation performed centrally by non-clinical staff independent of the chief investigators, with random variation in block sizes of two to eight for each centre. Trialists prepared and labelled syringes identically within the pharmacy department at the centre, concealing treatment allocation from study site investigators and the infant's caregivers. They discouraged but did not prohibit open-label corticosteroids after randomisation; some infants may have received both a second course of their initially allocated study drug and open-label corticosteroids. No one apart from the pharmacist at individual study sites had access to the treatment code. Trial authors reported short-term outcomes for all enrolled infants. Follow-up included the following (Doyle 2007 (follow-up publication of <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2006</LINK>)): Paediatricians and psychologists who were blinded to treatment group allocation assessed surviving children at 24 months of age, corrected for prematurity, at individual study sites. They considered children to have a neurosensory impairment if they had cerebral palsy (criteria included abnormalities of tone and motor dysfunction), blindness (bilateral vision worse than 6/60), deafness requiring hearing aids or worse, or developmental delay (defined as a MDI on the BSID &lt; 85 (&lt; -1 SD) (<LINK REF="REF-Bayley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayley 1993</LINK>). Researchers graded severity of the neurosensory disability imposed by the impairment as follows: severe - bilateral blindness, cerebral palsy with the child unlikely ever to walk, or MDI &lt; 55 (&lt; -3 SD); moderate - deafness, cerebral palsy in children not walking at two years but expected to walk, or MDI from 55 to &lt; 70 (-3 SD to &lt; -2 SD); mild - cerebral palsy but walking at two years with only minimal limitation of movement or MDI 70 to &lt; 85 (&lt; -1 SD). They considered remaining children to have no neurosensory disability. Major neurosensory disability comprised moderate or severe disability. The follow-up rate of survivors at two years was 98% (58/59).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Durand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1995</LINK>, investigators performed randomisation via blind drawing of random cards contained in sealed envelopes. Clinical personnel were not aware of the group assignment of any infant. Study authors present outcome data for 43 of the 44 enrolled infants. They excluded one infant in the control group from all analyses as the result of birth weight &lt; 500 grams. Follow-up consisted of the following (Durand 2012 (personal communication follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Durand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1995</LINK>)): A developmental paediatrician, a paediatric neurologist, and other specialised personnel (including a psychologist) assessed surviving children at 12 months of age, corrected for prematurity. A paediatric ophthalmologist performed all eye examinations. All staff were blinded to treatment group allocation. Children were considered to have a neurosensory impairment if they had cerebral palsy (defined as non-progressive motor impairment with abnormal muscle tone and decreased range of movements), blindness (bilateral vision worse than 6/60), deafness requiring hearing aids or worse, or developmental delay (defined as MDI &lt; 70 on the BSID). The follow-up rate of survivors at 12 months was 78% (29/37).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harkavy 1989</LINK> achieved randomisation by using random numbers held in the pharmacy. Clinicians and investigators were unaware of treatment assignments. Study authors provided outcome data for 21 of the 22 enrolled infants. One infant died after consent but before random assignment to a treatment group. Follow-up consisted of the following (Harkavy 2002 (personal communication follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harkavy 1989</LINK>)): A neonatologist and an occupational therapist saw survivors at ages ranging from 6 to 24 months, corrected for prematurity. Observers were blinded to treatment group allocation. The follow-up rate of survivors was 32% (6/19). Trialists did not specify criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness. Psychological assessment included the MDI of the BSID. Study authors did not define major disability.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kari-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kari 1993</LINK>, researchers performed randomisation in blocks of 10 for each participating hospital. Clinicians and investigators were unaware of treatment assignments. Study authors present outcomes for all 41 infants enrolled in the trial. The number of infants recruited was only 25% of the estimate required for the sample size. Therefore, the study was discontinued after 26 months. Follow-up consisted of the following (<LINK REF="REF-Mieskonen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mieskonen 2003</LINK>): Only one of four centres in this multi-centre study provided follow-up; this centre contributed 23 of the 41 participants to the original study. Three infants died before discharge (one dexamethasone; two placebo). No late deaths in childhood are known. Survivors were followed in the hospital's outpatient clinic. One child in the dexamethasone group had deafness requiring a hearing aid, seizures treated with anticonvulsants, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and required assistance with schooling but did not have cerebral palsy at 7.8 years of age. This child would not co-operate with the respiratory component of the study. Another child in the dexamethasone group had no confirmed cerebral palsy at 2.6 years of age and was not traced at school age but was said to be attending normal school. One child in the placebo group had multiple difficulties in speech and cognitive function at five years of age and was expected to require extra help at school but refused further follow-up. Another child in the placebo group had minor difficulties in comprehension at five years of age but was lost to further follow-up. In total, 16 children participated in the follow-up study at seven to nine years of age. Trialists recorded neurological status at five years of age from hospital records, including assessments for cerebral palsy (abnormal muscle tone, increased tendon reflexes and positive Babinski sign, or persistent or exaggerated primitive reflexes, dyskinesia, or ataxia), visual or hearing deficits, and school maturity (details of testing not given). Severe disability comprised any of more than mild cerebral palsy, severe global delay (not defined), or sensory or other impairment requiring special schooling; moderate disability comprised any of mild cerebral palsy, severe deafness, moderate global delay (extra help needed at school, assessment of global retardation or language problems), or home oxygen beyond three years of age. For this meta-analysis, we have extracted data for major neurological disability for those with more than mild cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness, or needing extra help with schooling. One investigator blinded to neonatal details then assessed children at 7.8 to 9.2 years of age, including presumably treatment group allocation. Age was not corrected for prematurity. Study authors measured children for height and weight and performed lung function tests, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kazzi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kazzi 1990</LINK>, trialists achieved random assignment by drawing a pre-coded card prepared from a table of random numbers. They stratified infants by birth weight into three groups: less than 1000 grams, 1000 grams to 1250 grams, and 1251 grams to 1500 grams. The pharmacist drew the card from the appropriate group, and neither investigators nor nursery staff were aware of the treatment group. Study authors provided outcome data for all 23 enrolled infants and reported no follow-up component.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kothadia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kothadia 1999</LINK>, researchers randomised infants within six strata, defined in terms of birth weight (500 grams to 800 grams, 801 grams to 1100 grams, and 1101 grams to 1500 grams) and sex, with a block size of eight. They did not describe the exact method of randomisation. Control infants were given an equal volume of normal saline. Investigators assessed outcome data in a blinded fashion. Study authors initially described zero cross-over in this trial, but review of data at age 19 years revealed that one child who was randomised to placebo received a 42-day tapering course of placebo, then subsequently a 12-day tapering course of dexamethasone. In addition, three of the children randomised to placebo received 24-hour courses of dexamethasone for upper airway oedema. Follow-up consisted of the following: A developmental paediatrician or one of two neonatologists and a physical therapist saw survivors at 12 months of age, corrected for prematurity, if any neurological abnormality was detected. Observers were blind to treatment group allocation. The follow-up rate of survivors at 12 months of age was 98% (93/95). Trialists specified criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Paediatric ophthalmologists diagnosed blindness. Study authors did not define deafness. Psychological assessment included the MDI of the BSID; investigators assessed the first 10 infants using the original Bayley Scales, and the remainder using BSID-II. Major disability comprised any of cerebral palsy, blindness, or an MDI &lt; -2 SD. Trialists assessed children again at 4 to 6 years of age and at 8 to 11 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Washburn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Washburn 2006</LINK>). Parents, children, and follow-up examiners were not aware of children's randomisation assignment. Investigators diagnosed cerebral palsy at 4 to 6 years if the child had a neuromotor abnormality detected on neurological examination by a nurse with specialised training in neurodevelopmental follow-up, and if the parent reported that the child was receiving treatment for cerebral palsy. A parent was interviewed again at the 8- to 11-year visit as to whether a diagnosis of cerebral palsy had ever been made. For intelligence and academic achievement, at the four- to six-year visit, a child psychologist assessed the child using the Differential Abilities Scales (DAS), the Kaufman Survey of Early Academic and Language Skills (K-SEALS), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales (VABS). At the 8- to 11-year visit, a child psychologist assessed the child using the Wechsler Individual Achievement Tests (WIAT), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). Investigators defined a major neurodevelopmental impairment at 4 to 6 years and/or at 8 to 11 years as cerebral palsy, and at 4 to 6 years of age as mental retardation (IQ &lt; 70 on either the DAS (n = 11 participants) or the WISC-III (n = 71 participants) and a VABS composite score &lt; 70) at last follow-up. For five dexamethasone-treated and eight placebo-treated children who did not undergo intelligence testing at 4 to 6 years or at 8 to 11 years of age, they defined major neurodevelopmental impairment as blindness, cerebral palsy (at the most recent visit), or a Bayley MDI &lt; 70 for adjusted age. Trialists assessed all survivors at least once at or beyond 1 year of age. The follow-up rate at 4 to 11 years of age was 88% (84/95). Trialists collected respiratory data at 8 to 11 years of age using pulmonary function testing. They obtained forced expiratory flow rates and volumes (FVC, fFEV<SUB>1</SUB>, the FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC ratio, and the FEF<SUB>25%-75%</SUB>) expressed as % of predicted as appropriate and considered abnormal if below the fifth percentile. They determined TLC and RV from body plethysmography and expressed these as a ratio (RV/TLC), as well as pulmonary diffusing capacity (diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO)) via the single-breath carbon monoxide technique. However, most children could not cope with plethysmography and the single-breath diffusion manoeuvre, hence study authors did not analyse TLC, RV, and diffusing capacity data. Investigators also assessed asthma diagnosis and airway reactivity<I>.</I> They categorised children as having asthma if the parent or guardian reported that the child had asthma, had used medications for asthma treatment, or both. A subsample of children underwent maximal progressive exercise testing on a cycle ergometer as part of the larger study. Researchers repeated spirometry immediately and five minutes post exercise, as well as 20 minutes following three puffs of albuterol delivered with a spacer. They used a 15% decrease in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> from pre-exercise values as the criterion to define exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and considered a 12% increase in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> from pre-exercise levels to be a positive bronchodilator response. The follow-up rate at 8 to 11 years of age for respiratory data was 72% (68/95) but was 66% (63/95) for respiratory function testing. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kovacs-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kovacs 1998</LINK> assigned eligible infants using a "blocked" randomisation procedure, and only the designated pharmacist who prepared all study medications was aware of group assignments. Researchers stratified infants before randomisation into two categories according to gestational age (22 to 26 weeks vs 27 to 29 weeks).

Supplemental oxygen requirements were also less throughout the study period in the dexamethasone group (P = 0.013). Mortality and durations of supplemental oxygen, ventilator support, and hospital stay did not differ significantly between groups. The need for insulin therapy for hyperglycaemia was increased in the dexamethasone group (P &lt; 0.05).

Data show no statistically significant differences between total groups of survivors in time receiving supplemental oxygen and length of stay in hospital, although trends favoured the dexamethasone group. Twenty-five infants in each group died before hospital discharge; most were ventilator-dependent at trial entry. Open treatment with steroids was later given to 18% of the dexamethasone group and 43% of the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). We found little evidence of serious side effects and noted that infection rates in particular were similar in the two groups. At follow-up, results show no clear differences between randomised groups in the original study for outcomes at three years. This conclusion held when data for cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness were updated on the basis of results obtained at 13 to 17 years of age. Rates of intellectual impairment and moderate and severe disability at 13 to 17 years of age were similar in both groups, and data reveal no substantial differences in lung function or growth z-scores, nor in proportions with high blood pressure.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1989</LINK>: Infants in the 42-day dexamethasone group, but not those in the 18-day group, were weaned from mechanical ventilation significantly faster than controls (medians 29, 73, and 84 days, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) and from supplemental oxygen (medians 65, 190, and 136 days, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). We noted no clinical complications of steroid administration. At follow-up, combining both dexamethasone groups revealed no significant differences between dexamethasone-treated and control children for rates of cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, developmental delay, or major neurosensory disability among survivors, nor for death or survival with cerebral palsy or death or survival with major disability among those randomised. Neurological status was confirmed at four years of age for all children (Cummings 2002 (personal communication follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1989</LINK>)). Data show no significant differences in psychometric test scores at 15 months or 4 years of age. Between 4 and 15 years, one child in the 18-day group had died, leaving 22 survivors, all of whom (100%) were assessed at 15 years of age. We found no significant differences between dexamethasone groups combined and the placebo group for any of the major neurological outcomes, nor for growth or respiratory function.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2006</LINK>: Substantially more infants were extubated successfully by 10 days in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 11.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 39.0; P &lt; 0.001). Twelve of 21 dexamethasone-treated infants were reintubated after initial extubation compared with one of four placebo-treated infants. Mortality was reduced but not significantly in the dexamethasone group (OR 0.52, 0.14 to 1.95; P = 0.33), and the same was true for BPD among survivors (OR 0.58, 0.08 to 3.32; P = 0.71). Combined rates of death or BPD (86% vs 91%; P = 0.45) and death or severe BPD (34% vs 46%; P = 0.33) were not different between groups. During the first 10 days, mean airway pressure (MAP), peak inspiratory pressure, and inspired oxygen concentration all decreased significantly in the dexamethasone group compared with the placebo group. Data show no differences between groups in rates of high blood glucose levels or high blood pressure. Open-label use of corticosteroids, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and severe retinopathy of prematurity were similar for the two groups. No infant had gastrointestinal perforation or bleeding. One infant in the placebo group had cardiac hypertrophy, but none in the dexamethasone group. At follow-up, rates of cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness, of Bayley MDI or Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) &lt; -1 SD, or of major neurological disability were similar in the two groups, as were combined rates of death or cerebral palsy, or death or major disability.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1995</LINK>: Data show significant differences in compliance and tidal volume in the dexamethasone group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Dexamethasone also significantly decreased inspired oxygen concentration and MAP (both P &lt; 0.001) and facilitated successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, chest radiograph changes) was significantly decreased in the dexamethasone group (2/21 vs 8/17; P &lt; 0.01). Survival with BPD was also better in the dexamethasone group (19/23 vs 9/20; P &lt; 0.02). Except for transient increases in blood pressure and plasma glucose, we found no evidence of adverse effects of treatment and no significant differences in rates of infection, intraventricular haemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity. Thirteen infants in the control group subsequently received dexamethasone.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harkavy 1989</LINK>: Dexamethasone treatment reduced age at extubation (39.4 days vs 57.2 days) compared with placebo. Average oxygen requirements for the steroid-treated group were significantly lower during the first 10 days of treatment, but data show no significant differences between groups in age of weaning to room air (74.9 days vs 95.5 days), age at discharge (111 days vs 119 days), or number of deaths (1 (11%) vs 2 (17%)). Dexamethasone therapy was associated with a significantly increased incidence of hyperglycaemia (89% vs 8%; P = 0.01) but did not influence significantly the incidence of hypertension, intraventricular haemorrhage, infection, or retinopathy of prematurity. Steroid-treated infants also had a significant delay in weight gain (P &lt; 0.02) during the first three weeks of treatment. Among the small number of children followed up, cerebral palsy was diagnosed in one of three in the dexamethasone group and in two of three controls.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kari-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kari 1993</LINK>: At 28 days of life, pulmonary outcome was significantly better among girls treated with dexamethasone but not in all infants. Data show no significant differences between groups in long-term outcomes, except for a shorter duration of supplemental oxygen among dexamethasone-treated female infants. After one week of dexamethasone treatment, results show significant but short-lived suppression of basal cortisol concentrations and of the adrenal response to ACTH. Investigators observe no serious side effects. At follow-up, the only hospital providing follow-up data reported no significant differences between dexamethasone and control children in rates of mortality, cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, or major neurological disability, nor of death or survival with cerebral palsy or death or survival with major neurological disability among those randomised. At seven to nine years of age, data show some improvement in lung function among eight steroid-treated children compared with seven controls, and no substantial differences in height or weight between steroid and placebo groups, but data were not reported in a form that would allow meta-analysis. No children had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</P>

Fewer infants in the dexamethasone group had failed to be extubated by the third day (82% vs 97%) or the seventh day (63% vs 90%). Data show no significant differences in rates of death, infection, or severe retinopathy of prematurity. At one-year follow-up, more surviving dexamethasone-treated infants had cerebral palsy (24% vs 7%) and abnormal findings on neurological examination (42% vs 18%). However, deaths before one year were more frequent in the placebo group (26%) than in the dexamethasone group (12%); thus, rates of the combined outcome, death or cerebral palsy at one year, were not significantly different (dexamethasone 33% vs placebo 31%). An additional child in the placebo group was reported to have cerebral palsy at age four to six years. Risk of cerebral palsy was higher among surviving dexamethasone-treated children at four to six years of age, although cognitive, functional, and medical outcomes were not significantly different between treated and non-treated survivors. The combined outcome, death or cerebral palsy, was also similar at four- to six-year follow-up. Results show no substantial differences in rates of asthma, nor in blood pressure or growth.

Fewer infants in the dexamethasone group had failed to be extubated by the seventh day (73% vs 93%). Infants in this group also had better pulmonary compliance at 10 days, but comparison with controls revealed that all improvements were not maintained over ensuing weeks.

Upon examination of only 28-day outcomes, babies in this study's late group can be considered as controls, as they did not receive dexamethasone until after 28 days. Mortality at 28 days was 7/182 in the early group (treated) compared with 16/189 in the late group (controls). Oxygen was required on day 28 in 141/182 versus 168/189, and the combination of 28-day mortality or oxygen requirement was evident in 147/182 versus 184/189; the latter was significant (P &lt; 0.001).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-10-18 09:45:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), corticosteroids improve respiratory compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Ariagno-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ariagno 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avery-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Avery 1985</LINK>), while reducing the need for oxygen supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harkavy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kazzi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kazzi 1990</LINK>), but data show no evidence of effects on duration of hospitalisation. Steroids facilitate extubation in ventilator-dependent infants from seven days up to 28 days after treatment. In this review, we found a significant reduction in neonatal mortality, with number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes of 17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 100). Mortality in hospital or at latest reported age was not significantly reduced. Whether corticosteroids given after the first week of life really improve survival among infants developing BPD remains to be confirmed.</P>
<P>Steroids have other significant effects. They can cause weight loss or poor weight gain (<LINK REF="STD-Ariagno-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ariagno 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harkavy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harkavy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 1992</LINK>). Although catchup growth after steroid therapy has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1993</LINK>), worries about reduced brain growth have been noted in animal and human studies (<LINK REF="REF-Gramsbergen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gramsbergen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Weichsel-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weichsel 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papile-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Papile 1998</LINK>, respectively). Animal studies have also shown abnormal lung growth (<LINK REF="REF-Tschanz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschanz 1995</LINK>). The finding of a borderline statistically significant increase in severe retinopathy of prematurity among survivors was not accompanied by significant increases in either blindness or the need for corrective lenses.</P>
<P>For this review, data on long-term neurosensory follow-up were available from 16 studies comprising 940 randomised infants, but these studies were of varying methodological quality. The significant increase in abnormal neurological examination among those randomised is of potential concern; however, this is tempered by data showing that cerebral palsy and major neurosensory disability, both overall and among survivors, were not significantly increased, and that abnormal neurological examination findings were reported in only four of the 15 follow-up studies and in only 200 randomised participants. It should be noted, however, that some of the studies reporting cerebral palsy as an outcome did so early in childhood; before five years of age, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy is not certain in all cases (<LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1982</LINK>). Moreover, only one study was designed primarily to test effects of postnatal steroids on adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2006</LINK>), and all studies were underpowered to detect clinically important differences in long-term neurosensory outcomes. Researchers performing animal studies have expressed concern about possible adverse effects of corticosteroids used at these doses during early postnatal life on neurodevelopment of very immature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Weichsel-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weichsel 1977</LINK>). Clearly, more information on long-term outcomes of infants is needed.</P>
<P>Clinicians must weigh the benefits of acute improvement in respiratory function and increased chances of extubation (with possible improved survival) against potential detrimental effects, both metabolic and neurological. Dexamethasone may be a harmful drug for the immature brain, and clinicians must consider limiting its use to situations in which it is essential to achieve weaning from the ventilator. Lower doses and shorter courses should be considered for these infants; the DART study (a randomised controlled trial of low-dose, short-course dexamethasone in ventilator-dependent infants), which provided a total dose of only 0.89 mg/kg over 10 days, reported short-term benefits of extubation and reduced respiratory support (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2006</LINK>). We found limited data on effects of inhaled steroids among infants with BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Giffin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giffin 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-La-Force-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Force 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK>), but this potentially useful intervention should lead to fewer systemic side effects and warrants further study. Additional studies of low-dose systemic corticosteroids for infants at high risk of developing BPD beyond the first week of life are warranted.</P>

<P>Review authors assessed the quality of evidence for seven major outcomes: mortality at 36 weeks, mortality at latest reported age, BPD at 36 weeks, home on oxygen, death or BPD at 36 weeks, cerebral palsy at latest reported age, and death or cerebral palsy at latest reported age (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We assessed the quality of evidence for all outcomes as high, except BPD at 36 weeks, which we downgraded to moderate quality because we noted risk of publication bias in these studies.</P>

<P>The condition of the ventilator-dependent infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) after the age of seven days may be at least transiently improved by a course of dexamethasone. Such treatment facilitates extubation from the ventilator and reduces the rate of BPD and the need for a later course of steroids and for home oxygen therapy. Survival to 28 days is generally improved, but whether this is maintained overall remains to be confirmed. However, researchers have reported significant short-term side effects, including hyperglycaemia and hypertension, and, more important, some evidence of long-term side effects, including severe retinopathy of prematurity and abnormal neurological examination findings. The methodological quality of studies determining long-term outcomes is limited in some cases; surviving children have been assessed predominantly before school age, and no study has been sufficiently powered to detect important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Given evidence of both benefits and harms of treatment, and limitations of the evidence at present, it appears prudent to reserve the use of late corticosteroids for infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube after the first week of life, and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-18 09:48:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies are needed to examine the lowest safe dose of corticosteroid. Two large ongoing placebo-controlled trials of hydrocortisone in ventilator-dependent infants beyond the first week of life may be able to establish the role of hydrocortisone, if any, in intubated infants. Both studies reported a follow-up component during early childhood. Hydrocortisone at more physiological doses should be compared with dexamethasone at lower doses for ventilator-dependent infants. Researchers might find it worthwhile to undertake studies with other steroid drugs, such as betamethasone or methylprednisolone. Review authors have noted a compelling need for long-term follow-up studies on all children who have been enrolled in randomised trials of postnatal corticosteroids. Investigators must examine both major and more subtle (e.g. cognitive and behavioural) adverse neurological outcomes, in addition to long-term visual function. Effects of inhaled corticosteroids also require further study. New studies should be designed to assess overall risks and benefits of corticosteroids and should be sufficiently powered to detect important adverse long-term neurosensory sequelae.</P>
<P>Despite increasing use of non-invasive ventilation, infants become oxygen-dependent and may develop BPD. Outcomes of systemic corticosteroids given to infants on long-term non-invasive ventilation remain to be investigated..</P>

<P>For the previous version of this review, we sought randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid therapy by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 through August 2013), Embase, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, and Controlled-trials; by handsearching paediatric and perinatal journals; and by examining previous review articles and information received from practising neonatologists. We searched MEDLINE using the terms adrenal cortex hormones or dexamethasone or betamethasone or hydrocortisone or steroids or corticosteroids and limits randomised controlled trials, human, all infant: birth to 23 months. When possible, we contacted authors of all studies to confirm details of reported follow-up studies or to obtain information about long-term follow-up when none had been reported.</P>

<P>We used standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation and blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We added this information to the Characteristics of included studies table. We evaluated the following issues and entered findings into the risk of bias table.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>b. High risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>b. High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; or</P>
<P>b. Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk for outcome assessors;</P>
<P>b. High risk for outcome assessors; or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>b. High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (when it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>b. High risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early because of some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk;</P>
<P>b. High risk; or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
