<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Dipyridamole for preventing stroke and other vascular events in patients with vascular disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patients with symptoms of arterial disease have a high risk of getting a (possibly fatal) stroke or heart attack (myocardial infarction). Antiplatelet therapy with drugs like aspirin prevents blood clotting and reduces the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and death from vascular disease. Dipyridamole, another antiplatelet drug, given on its own or together with aspirin might reduce the risk even further. This review included 29 studies involving 23019 participants. When we compared the effects of dipyridamole (alone or together with aspirin) with aspirin alone there was no evidence of an effect on death from vascular causes. When we compared the effects on the occurrence of vascular events (strokes, heart attacks, and deaths from vascular diseases) the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole had an advantage over aspirin alone. This result holds particularly true for patients with ischaemic stroke.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Patients with limited cerebral ischaemia of arterial origin are at risk of serious vascular events (4% to 11% annually). Aspirin reduces that risk by 13%. In one trial, adding dipyridamole to aspirin was associated with a 22% risk reduction compared with aspirin alone. However, a systematic review of all trials of antiplatelet agents by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration showed that, in high-risk patients, there was virtually no difference between the aspirin-dipyridamole combination and aspirin alone. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of dipyridamole versus control in the secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with vascular disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (searched June 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to May 2006). We contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies in the search for further data on published and unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We selected randomised long-term secondary prevention trials with concealed treatment allocation, treatment for more than one month, starting within six months after presentation of an arterial vascular disease. Treatment consisted of dipyridamole with or without other antiplatelet drugs compared with no drug or an antiplatelet drug other than dipyridamole.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-nine trials were included, with 23019 participants, among whom 1503 vascular deaths and 3438 fatal and non-fatal vascular events occurred during follow up. Compared with control, dipyridamole had no clear effect on vascular death (relative risk (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.12). This result was not influenced by the dose of dipyridamole or type of presenting vascular disease. Compared with control, dipyridamole appeared to reduce the risk of vascular events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95). This effect was only statistically significant in patients presenting with cerebral ischaemia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>For patients who presented with arterial vascular disease, there was no evidence that dipyridamole, in the presence or absence of another antiplatelet drug reduced the risk of vascular death, though it reduces the risk of further vascular events. This benefit was found only in patients presenting after cerebral ischaemia. There was no evidence that dipyridamole alone was more efficacious than aspirin. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-06 13:26:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and minor ischaemic strokes are at risk of serious vascular events (death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction). A systematic review of all trials of antiplatelet agents by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATT) provided very strong evidence that, in patients with a history of a vascular disease, antiplatelet drugs reduce the risk of serious vascular events by about a quarter (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). Aspirin was the most widely tested antiplatelet drug. By comparison with the very large number of trials of aspirin, there were relatively few trials which assessed the efficacy of dipyridamole. A number of trials included in the review tested the hypothesis that the combination of dipyridamole with aspirin might be more effective than aspirin alone, but it appeared that, in high risk patients, there was virtually no difference between the aspirin-dipyridamole combination and aspirin alone (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). We therefore sought to examine the trial data with a somewhat different approach to assess the effects of dipyridamole in greater detail.</P>
<P>The most appropriate way to make a more detailed assessment has been the subject of some debate. Is it better to assess the efficacy of medication for secondary prevention of vascular complications by looking at subgroups of high risk patients, or at all these patients together (<LINK REF="REF-Algra-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algra 1999a</LINK>)? A similar discussion applies to the most appropriate combination of vascular outcome events, that is, vascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. </P>
<P>Patients who enrolled in clinical trials after a TIA or non-disabling ischaemic stroke have an annual risk of important vascular events (death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction) of between 4% and 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Algra-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algra 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APT-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT I 1994</LINK>). The corresponding estimate for population-based studies is 9% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 1992</LINK>). The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>) showed an absolute risk reduction of 22 to 36 per 1000 high risk patients treated with antiplatelet therapy for two years; this number was 36 per 1000 patients after cerebral ischaemia. Aspirin alone, in a daily dose of 30 mg or more, offers only modest protection after cerebral ischaemia: it reduces the incidence of major vascular events by 13% in such patients (<LINK REF="REF-Algra-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algra 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Algra-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algra 1999b</LINK>). In direct comparisons of different doses of aspirin no differences were found in the efficacy between doses of 300 mg and 1200 mg (<LINK REF="REF-UK_x002d_TIA-Trial-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK-TIA Trial 1991</LINK>) nor between 30 mg and 283 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Dutch-TIA-Trial-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutch TIA Trial 1991</LINK>). The efficacy of dipyridamole, an alternative antiplatelet agent, was assessed in the European Stroke Prevention Study 2 (<LINK REF="STD-ESPS_x002d_2-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">ESPS-2 1997a</LINK>), a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, with four treatment arms: aspirin (50 mg daily), dipyridamole (400 mg daily), both drugs or neither. The combination treatment showed a relative risk reduction of 22% of major vascular events over aspirin. However, a meta-analysis of the four previous studies that compared the efficacy of the combination therapy with aspirin alone (<LINK REF="STD-ACCSG-1985" TYPE="STUDY">ACCSG 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AICLA-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">AICLA 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaye-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaye 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toulouse-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Toulouse 1982a</LINK>), showed a relative risk of 0.97 (<LINK REF="REF-Algra-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algra 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APT-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT I 1994</LINK>). In 2006 the results of <LINK REF="STD-ESPRIT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIT 2006</LINK> were published and showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80 in favour of the combination therapy of dipyridamole 400 mg daily combined with aspirin 30 mg to 325 mg daily compared with aspirin alone.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, which was last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator in June 2006. To access the trials registers of the Cochrane Heart Group and the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2006). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to May 2006) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For a previous version of this review, carried out in April 2002, we searched the trials register of the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration and contacted the following Dutch manufacturers of dipyridamole in the search for other published and unpublished studies: Boehringer Ingelheim, Centrafarm, Dumex, Genfarma, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Katwijk Farma, Multipharma, Pharbita, Pharmachemie, and Stephar.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors (EDS and AA) independently selected those trials which met the inclusion criteria and extracted details of randomisation methods, blinding of treatments and assessments, whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible from the published data, whether treatment groups were comparable with regard to major prognostic factors, the number of patients who were excluded or lost to follow up, definition of outcome events, and entry and exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the two review authors on the basis of these extracted data. In addition, dose and type of antiplatelet treatments, duration of follow up and the numbers of defined outcome events were also recorded. Unpublished data, collected by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, were used. The remaining data were extracted independently by the same two review authors and cross checked. </P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were planned in advance: presenting disease, age (less than or equal to 65 year versus 65 years plus), sex, history of ischaemic heart disease, dose of dipyridamole, methodological quality and type of cerebral ischaemia (large vessel disease versus small vessel disease). Separate analyses on the use of dipyridamole in the presence and absence of other antiplatelet drugs were carried out. The data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. If outcome data on some randomised patients were lacking, both a best and worst case scenario were planned: the best case scenario (with regards to treatment) assumed that none of the patients excluded from the reference group had the outcome of interest whilst all those excluded from the reference group did, and vice versa for the worst case analysis. Relative risk reductions were calculated by means of the Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2).The results are presented as relative risk (RR) ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI), analysed with a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity was tested with the I-squared (I<SUP>2)</SUP> heterogeneity statistic. We assessed the presence of statistical differences between the pre-specified subgroups by means of the methods for subgroup analysis as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 13:24:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included, which studied 42 comparisons of treatments, with a total of 23,019 participants, among whom 1503 vascular deaths and 3438 vascular events (fatal and non-fatal) occurred during follow up. The mean follow-up duration of the trials ranged from one month to seven years. Data from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Caneschi-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Caneschi 1985a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Caneschi-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Caneschi 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Igloe-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Igloe 1970</LINK>) were not published and not used in the meta-analysis of the second cycle of the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). Sixteen trials were performed in Europe, seven in North America, two in both Europe and North America, one in Australia, one in the Middle East and two in Asia. The mean age of the patients ranged from 47 to 67 years. In the included studies 42% to 100% of the patients were male. In 13 studies, the patients presented with a cardiac disease, in nine with (transient) cerebral ischaemia, in four with arterial peripheral vascular diseases, in two studies patients on haemodialysis were included and in one study patients with diabetic retinopathy were included. Daily dipyridamole doses varied between 150 mg and 800 mg: four trials used 150 mg per day, 16 trials 200 mg to 300 mg per day and nine trials at least 400 mg per day of which one trial partly used 800 mg per day. Three trials used a modified-release (retard) preparation of dipyridamole. Other antiplatelet drugs were aspirin and sulfinpyrazone.</P>
<P>Not all trials had vascular events as a primary outcome. However, most of these trials published additional data about vascular death or vascular events. Primary published data were used, but missing data were completed from the publication of the second cycle of the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, which published additional data not available in the original publications. Therefore, the authors of the source publications were not contacted again to obtain missing data. The mean follow-up time ranged from one month to 60 months. Information about the description of each included study can be found in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>

<P>All 29 trials were stated to be randomised, but the method of concealment was unclear in 18 trials. In seven trials baseline data were not sufficiently described to conclude whether there was good baseline comparability between treatment groups. All trials, except five, were stated to be double-blind studies. For 15 trials we could not determine whether intention-to-treat analysis was performed or might be reconstructed from the published data. In eight trials the number of lost or excluded patients was not described. Seventeen studies did not describe exactly the method of monitoring compliance and in 12 trials nothing was reported on the compliance of the patients. All trials defined criteria for the inclusion of patients; eight trials did not contain any information about exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Information about the methodological quality of each included study can be found in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 13:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The 29 included trials mostly did not separately report on the 11 types of outcome measures; data on outcome measures were available or could be extracted for:<BR/>(1) the composite event 'vascular death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction or major bleeding complication' in two trials;<BR/>(2) vascular death, non-fatal stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction in two trials;<BR/>(3) death (all causes) in 19 trials;<BR/>(4) vascular death in 15 trials;<BR/>(5) ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage in four trials;<BR/>(6) myocardial infarction in 14 trials;<BR/>(7) death or dependent at end of follow up in none of the trials;<BR/>(8) major bleeding complication, that is any fatal or non-fatal intracranial or major extracranial haemorrhage, in six trials;<BR/>(9) fatal bleed (intra or extracranial) in two trials;<BR/>(10) intracranial bleed in five trials;<BR/>(11) major extracranial bleed, according to the definition of the original investigator, in five trials.</P>
<P>In some trials the number of patients with a stroke during follow up was described; however, no further information could be found on whether this number included haemorrhagic strokes. Also it was often unclear whether the fatal strokes were calculated as separate outcome events or were included in this number of reported strokes.</P>
<P>The outcome data extracted from the original publications did not always match exactly the data from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, which used individual patient data at the end of scheduled follow up, obtained from the trial investigators. Since most of our defined outcome events could not be extracted from the original publications, we pragmatically decided to analyse two outcome measures: vascular death and vascular events. The definition of vascular events, according to the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, is 'vascular death or any death from unknown cause, non-fatal stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction'. The safety measure was, according the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, the combination of all major extracranial bleeding complications plus all fatal extracranial bleeds. We used the data from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration for this review and checked the observed inconsistencies.</P>
<P>For the analyses we assumed that the published outcome events could be used in an intention-to-treat model in all trials and that no patient was lost if no lost to follow up was reported. Since not many patients were described as lost, no worst or best case scenario was performed. A fixed-effect model was used. Some trials were split up (extension a, b, etc) because they contained different treatment comparisons. However, no patient has been included twice in the same analysis. No significant heterogeneity between the studies was found.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons 1, 4, 6: Dipyridamole versus control</HEADING>
<P>Compared with control, there was no evidence that, in patients who presented with an arterial vascular disease, dipyridamole, in the presence or absence of other antiplatelet drugs, had any effect on vascular death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12) in 21 trials (23 comparisons). This result was not influenced by the dose of dipyridamole (P value for differences between subgroups = 0.86) or by the type of presenting vascular disease (P = 0.85). However, there was a reduction in the risk of vascular events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95). This result reached statistical significance in patients presenting after cerebral ischaemia, who were randomly allocated to receive 400 mg dipyridamole at least. Again, there were no statistical differences according to dose of dipyridamole (P = 0.20) or qualifying disease (P = 0.78). There were no differences in major extracranial and fatal extracranial bleeding complications in patients allocated to dipyridamole, compared with controls (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Dipyridamole plus aspirin versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Combination treatment of dipyridamole and aspirin compared with placebo had a RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.01) for vascular death and a RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.80) for vascular events in 15 trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: Dipyridamole versus other antiplatelet drug</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between dipyridamole and aspirin in the avoidance of vascular death (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37) or the prevention of vascular events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18). These data originated from three trials, where ESPS-2 contributed 98% of the information. One small trial compared the combination of dipyridamole with aspirin versus sulfinpyrazone.</P>

<P>There was no evidence of an effect of the combination of dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with aspirin on vascular death; the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.14). Based on data from 13 trials, there was a significant reduction in vascular events; the RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.96). The combination treatment had a RR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.54) for bleeding complications (all major extracranial plus fatal extracranial bleeding complications).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Inclusion of trials</HEADING>
<P>The aim of this meta-analysis was to include all randomised long-term secondary prevention trials on patients presenting with an arterial vascular disease (excluding presumed embolism from the heart). We included trials of patients presenting with a cardiac disease, but excluded those that accepted patients after a major intervention, for example coronary bypass grafting, because of procedure-related side effects. In the trials of patients with cerebral ischaemia, it was not always clear whether a cardiac source of embolism was used as an exclusion criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Caneschi-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Caneschi 1985a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Caneschi-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Caneschi 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ESPS_x002d_1-1990" TYPE="STUDY">ESPS-1 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stoke-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Stoke 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toulouse-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Toulouse 1982a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Toulouse-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Toulouse 1982b</LINK>). Trials with haemodialysis patients were included, since the cause of nephropathy in a large group of patients is of atherosclerotic origin and all haemodialysis patients are prone to develop atherosclerosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the trials</HEADING>
<P>All included trials were randomised and controlled. Not all trials published information about the method of concealment, monitoring of treatments and compliance, number of patients lost to follow up and whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible. However, these deficiencies were confined mainly to the smaller trials. There was no significant heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome events</HEADING>
<P>The type of outcome events varied greatly between the included RCTs. Some trials did not even have the primary intention to investigate vascular endpoints (<LINK REF="STD-Atlanta-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Atlanta 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DAMAD-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">DAMAD 1989a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-DAMAD-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">DAMAD 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-German-Fistula-1992" TYPE="STUDY">German Fistula 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hess-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Hess 1985a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Hess-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Hess 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Igloe-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Igloe 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Libretti-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Libretti 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misra-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PISA-2001" TYPE="STUDY">PISA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoop_x002d_I-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop-I 1983a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Schoop_x002d_I-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop-I 1983b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994b</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994c" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994c</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994d" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirecki-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Wirecki 1967</LINK>). Therefore, we decided to reduce the number of outcome measures in this meta analysis to those which were extractable from most of the original publications or from the data collected by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration: vascular death and vascular events. As a measure for safety we used the combination of major extracranial bleeding complication (according to the definition of the original investigator) plus fatal extracranial bleeding complication, according to the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dose of dipyridamole</HEADING>
<P>Different doses of dipyridamole were used, therefore subgroup analyses were performed in which three dosage groups were chosen. One trial compared dipyridamole in the presence of different doses of aspirin in the treatment and control group (150 mg versus 300 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Caneschi-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Caneschi 1985a</LINK>). However, in the Dutch TIA trial no influence on the number of outcome events was observed between such a difference in aspirin dose (<LINK REF="REF-Dutch-TIA-Trial-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutch TIA Trial 1991</LINK>). We present effect estimates for three groups of dipyridamole doses. Such indirect comparisons of treatment effect do not provide a very reliable assessment of the effects of different doses (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). However, we were unable to identify any trials directly comparing one dose of dipyridamole with another. The confidence intervals of the effect estimates for the three different dipyridamole dosage strata overlap considerably. So, there are no indications of differential efficacy according to dipyridamole dose. It should be noted that the largest trials with the largest effects used a modified release preparation (<LINK REF="STD-ESPS_x002d_2-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">ESPS-2 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-ESPS_x002d_2-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">ESPS-2 1997b</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-ESPS_x002d_2-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">ESPS-2 1997c</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-ESPS_x002d_2-1997d" TYPE="STUDY">ESPS-2 1997d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ESPRIT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIT 2006</LINK>). The modified release form of dipyridamole is studied in these two clinical trials and only one other small trial (<LINK REF="STD-PISA-2001" TYPE="STUDY">PISA 2001</LINK>). It is predictably bio-available and inhibits platelet function ex vivo (<LINK REF="REF-FitzGerald-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzGerald 1987</LINK>). A separate analysis was done post hoc according to formulation. The modified release form showed a significant risk reduction for the prevention of vascular events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.91). This effect was not found for the immediate release form in 4676 patients (RR 0.99 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Presenting disease</HEADING>
<P>The five different high-risk groups were analysed separately. More than three-quarters of all information originated from patients with cerebrovascular disease and about a sixth from patients with ischaemic heart disease. There was a benefit of dipyridamole in the absence or presence of another antiplatelet drug only in patients presenting with cerebral ischaemia in the secondary prevention of vascular events and not in the prevention of vascular death. The quantity of data about patients with arterial peripheral vascular disease, diabetes retinopathy or patients needing haemodialysis is minute.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review found that, for patients who presented with arterial vascular disease, there was no evidence that dipyridamole, in the presence or absence of another antiplatelet drug (chiefly aspirin) reduced the risk of vascular death, though it reduced the risk of further vascular events. However, this benefit was found only in patients presenting after cerebral ischaemia. There was no evidence that dipyridamole alone was more effective than aspirin alone. We found no evidence to support the routine use of dipyridamole alone as first line antiplatelet treatment in all patients at high risk of vascular events. We found no evidence to justify routine use of dipyridamole alone in preference to aspirin alone. The review provides evidence that, among patients presenting with arterial vascular disease, especially ischaemic stroke or TIA, the combination of dipyridamole plus aspirin is associated with a lower risk of further vascular events than aspirin alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More trials are needed in other high-risk groups of patients, such as those with arterial peripheral vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and patients undergoing haemodialysis to determine the role of dipyridamole in secondary prevention. Also, trials with aspirin plus extended release dipyridamole versus standard treatment (clopidogrel, or clopidogrel plus aspirin - whichever is the gold standard) might be warranted in patients with previous symptomatic atherothrombosis of the coronary arteries.</P>

<CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST>
<P>The authors are the principal investigators of ESPRIT, the European/Australian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial. However, this trial is run independently of any pharmaceutical company. The authors have received fees and expenses from producers of dipyridamole (Boehringer Ingelheim). After completion and full analysis of ESPRIT, we accepted financial support from Boehringer Ingelheim for post-hoc exploratory analyses of the ESPRIT trial data, for which a contract was signed. These post-hoc analyses pertain to the comparison of dipyridamole and aspirin versus aspirin alone; we negotiated complete scientific freedom in the contract. No money was received for any version of this review.</P>

<P>When revising the review, did you consider the article published in 2003 (1)? The quality control organisation of the sponsor of ESPS-2 trial was unable to detect invented data from several hundreds of patients. Because of incompetent quality control, all data (not only those submitted by one Dutch neurologist) are unreliable. I suggest that you should omit the data from ESPS-2 in the next revision.<BR/>

<P>We thank Dr Bardy for this feedback, because it allows us to explain that we consider the inclusion of the data of the ESPS-2 trial into our Cochrane review to be valid. Contrary to what Dr Bardy writes, it was the sponsor of ESPS-2, Boehringer-Ingelheim, that discovered the fraud by a Dutch neurologist. This was an action by a single person that damaged the reputation of (Dutch) vascular neurology considerably. The neurologist was eventually dismissed from his job and sentenced in court. This single centre fraud did not compromise the scientific validity of the data collected in the other centres. Analyses of the data, thus without those from the fraudulent centre, have been accepted broadly by the scientific community. Findings from the ESPRIT trial were virtually identical to those from ESPS-2, which provides in our view additional reassurance that the data from ESPS-2 can be accepted without hesitation.</P>

<P>Dear Doctors Algra, De Schryver and van Gijn,</P>
<P>Thank you for your reaction to my feedback above. I still disagree, for the following reasons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The sponsor only indentified some non-existing patients, first after false data from several hundreds of "patients" were included. The extent of the fraud was revealed by the laborious and lengthy investigation, performed by Netherlands Society of Neurology, several years after the publication of ESPS-2.</LI>
<LI>It seems not appropriate to exclude only the patients of one neurologist, all data initially approved by the monitor of that centre should also have been excluded. Still, if data of hundreds of non-existing patients were initially accepted, what does it tell of training and competence of the monitors?</LI>
<LI>Because of incompetent quality control, the results may have been influenced by other errors and faults, more difficult to detect than fraud.</LI>
<LI>In open trials, such as ESPRIT, there is always a bias preferring "new" therapy to old one. Considering this bias, no efficacy is needed to get a NNT 100/year. ESPRIT trialists themselves state: "The ESPRIT results, <U>combined with the results of previous trials</U>, provide sufficient evidence to prefer the combination regimen of aspirin plus dipyridamole over aspirin alone as antithrombotic therapy after cerebral ischaemia of arterial origin".</LI>
<LI>Finally, one must consider the "sponsor bias", as described in the classical article: Gtzsche PC. Methodology and overt and hidden bias in reports of 196 double-blind trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in rheumatoid arthritis. Control Clin Trials. 1989 Mar;10(1):31-56.</LI>
</OL>
<P>As former head of clinical trials section at National Agency for Medicines (now called Fimea), I have been involved in several inspections of clinical trials, in Finland and in other EU countries. At present, ESPS-2 and ESPRIT would probably not qualify as pivotal trials for marketing authorisation in EU.</P>

<P>In follow-up to the reaction of Dr Bardy to our previous reaction to his comment we want to quote from the article in the <I>Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde</I> to which Dr Bardy refers (1). The quote in Dutch "Nadat tijdens het monitoringsproces twijfel was gerezen over de betrouwbaarheid van de door de neuroloog verschafte gegevens uit 'centrum 2013' liet de financierende farmaceutische firma nader onderzoek verrichten." translates in English to "After doubts had arisen during the monitoring process on the reliability of the data provided from 'centre 2013' the sponsoring pharmaceutical company started further investigations.". Thus there is no doubt that the quality control of the sponsor of the trial led to the detection of the fraud. Therefore, as we wrote before, this single centre fraud did not compromise the scientific validity of the data collected in the other centres.</P>
