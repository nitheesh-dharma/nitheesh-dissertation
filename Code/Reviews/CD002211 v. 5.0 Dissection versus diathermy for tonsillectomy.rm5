<P>Tonsillectomy is one of the most common operations. Complications can include bleeding, during or after the operation, and pain. This review compared the effectiveness of two different surgical techniques in reducing these complications. The surgical techniques were diathermy (the use of high-frequency electrical current to cut tissue, remove the tonsil and control blood loss) and traditional cold dissection (where the tonsil is cut away and blood loss then controlled with ties, stitches or diathermy). Two studies (254 patients) are included in the review. The review of trials found that there is not enough evidence to demonstrate that diathermy is more effective than dissection. There was some evidence that patients who had diathermy tonsillectomy had less bleeding during the operation but more pain afterwards, however more research is needed.</P>

<P>Two studies (254 participants) are included in the review. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was low, although we excluded pain data from one study due to unclear risk of bias. One study compared monopolar dissection diathermy with conventional cold dissection in children and the other compared microscopic bipolar dissection with cold dissection in children and adults. These studies demonstrate reduced intraoperative bleeding, but increased pain in the diathermy group. There was no difference in the rate of secondary bleeding overall, although the power of both studies to detect a small difference was insufficient.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are insufficient data to show that one method of tonsillectomy is superior. There is evidence that pain may be greater after monopolar dissection. Large, well designed randomised controlled trials are necessary to determine the optimum method for tonsillectomy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-03 12:05:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2001 and previously updated in 2003.</P>
<P>Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures. Despite this, controversy exists regarding the surgical method associated with most comfort and least morbidity.</P>
<P>The operation of tonsillectomy is performed in many different ways according to the preference and experience of the surgeon. Broadly, it may be divided into two stages: removal of the tonsil, followed by control of bleeding (haemostasis). However, some newer techniques focus on simultaneous removal and haemostasis.</P>
<P>Tonsil removal has traditionally been achieved by cutting the pharyngeal mucosa with scissors, then dissection of the tonsil from the lateral pharyngeal wall. This is the so-called 'dissection' tonsillectomy. Haemostasis is achieved with ligatures (ties), sutures or diathermy once the tonsil has been removed.</P>
<P>Diathermy uses an electric current to coagulate blood vessels (stop bleeding) or to cut tissue. There are two main types: bipolar and monopolar. In bipolar diathermy, current passes through the tissue between the tips of a pair of forceps. The electrical energy is concentrated in a small area, therefore the tissue heats extremely rapidly, resulting in coagulation of blood vessels. Monopolar diathermy is similar, but in this case current passes away from the instrument and is dispersed safely to an electrode placed on the leg of the patient.</P>
<P>In diathermy tonsillectomy, the tonsil is removed and haemostasis secured simultaneously, using diathermy. Diathermy is used to incise the mucosa and divide the strands of tissue that bind the tonsil to the pharyngeal wall. At the same time the vessels that run in these strands are visualised and can be coagulated before they are divided, in theory minimising blood loss and speeding up the operation by 40% (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1976</LINK>) to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Haase-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haase 1962</LINK>). A further refinement of this technique uses the operating microscope to facilitate dissection and the identification of the glossopharyngeal nerve, said to be an important source of referred otalgia after tonsillectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Andrea-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrea 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most important potential complications of tonsillectomy are bleeding and pain. The operating surgeon may be more concerned about bleeding, but for the patient pain is likely to be the most important issue, together with concerns regarding time off school or work and resumption of normal activities.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Bleeding</HEADING>
<P>Bleeding may be during the operation (intraoperative), during the first 24 hours postoperatively (primary or reactionary haemorrhage), or after 24 hours (secondary haemorrhage). Primary and secondary haemorrhage may require further surgical intervention, particularly in children, when a significant proportion of the circulating volume may be lost. Rates for all types of haemorrhage vary slightly from series to series. <LINK REF="REF-Carmody-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carmody 1982</LINK> reported a primary haemorrhage rate of 1.03% in 3756 tonsillectomies, with 1% secondary haemorrhage (requiring active measures for control). <LINK REF="STD-Phillipps-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Phillipps 1989</LINK> compared diathermy haemostasis with ligation and quotes a primary bleed rate of 0.8% for diathermy and 1.3% for ligation. Secondary haemorrhage rates were also not significantly different, at 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively. However, <LINK REF="REF-Haase-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haase 1962</LINK> gives a 7% secondary bleed rate for diathermy. This difference may be real or simply reflect differences in reporting what constitutes a significant bleed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Pain is a significant factor after tonsillectomy, and may be severe enough to delay discharge from hospital, resumption of normal diet and normal activities (<LINK REF="REF-Drake_x002d_Lee-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake-Lee 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Tonsillectomy by dissection or diathermy (monopolar or bipolar). We considered haemostasis using ties, sutures or diathermy. We excluded trials in which sides were randomised (i.e. one tonsil by dissection, one by diathermy), as it was not possible to apply the primary outcome measure (bleeding) to such studies. This also applies to pain scores. Patients undergoing additional procedures were excluded in the original protocol, but adenoidectomy has subsequently been accepted, as long as blood loss was separated from tonsillectomy. We felt that adenoidectomy was otherwise unlikely to affect the clinical course or have any bearing on pain scores. The exclusion of adenoidectomy in this setting probably would not have reflected everyday practice.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-03 12:10:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kujawski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawski 1997</LINK>, we felt that bias was minimal in the haemorrhage arm of the study. However, we have not used the data given on postoperative pain since we felt there were too many confounding factors for meaningful comparisons to be made between the groups (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). The cut-off age of seven seems to have been used to allow for different methods of pain assessment (happy faces drawings for the under sevens and visual analogue scales for over sevens and adults). In our analysis we have used the data quoted for the entire population to maintain the sample size.</P>
<P>Although we have combined haemorrhage data from both studies, these figures should be interpreted with caution, as each uses a different method of diathermy dissection. The way in which haemorrhage was measured merits some comment. Both included studies assessed intraoperative bleeding by measuring the suction aspirate, but only <LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2000</LINK> weighed the swabs as well. This demonstrates the difficulty of comparing data for haemorrhage between studies. The quoted volumes for each study are remarkably similar, but the effect of weighing or not weighing swabs is difficult to determine. In both studies the volume of blood lost during surgery is low, and we would suggest that the difference between the two methods is only likely to be of relevance when operating on small children, in whom small volume losses may nevertheless be significant.</P>
<P>We were surprised to find no episodes of primary haemorrhage in either study. The percentage overall rate of secondary haemorrhage for each study can be calculated at 5.5% for <LINK REF="STD-Kujawski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawski 1997</LINK> and 6% for <LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2000</LINK>. Whilst both figures are higher than some of the studies quoted in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section, this probably reflects the careful design of the included trials and the broad definition used for secondary haemorrhage in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2000</LINK> is concerned with data in children only. This study was primarily designed to investigate the effect of diathermy on postoperative pain rather than haemorrhage. The sample size is small and the study does not have sufficient power to detect a small difference in haemorrhage rate. For example, to detect a risk difference of 10% in secondary haemorrhage between dissection and diathermy, we calculate that around 100 patients per group would be required.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2000</LINK> found that analgesic consumption was higher over the 12-day study period. This period includes the data recorded on parent diary cards, which by definition rely on the parents remembering to fill them in and record details accurately. Interestingly, the differences in analgesic use are not reflected in the figures quoted for time to return to normal diet or activity, which showed no statistical difference between the methods of tonsillectomy. Such data are highly subjective and may be unreliable, but one could argue that activity and diet are of more relevance to the child than analgesic consumption. Indeed, in their discussion the authors assert that a difference of one day in the time to return to normal diet is of clinical significance. Accepting these limitations, this study gives useful information for parents regarding the likely impact of tonsillectomy on their child. Regardless of the method of dissection, they can expect about a week to pass before their child is eating a full diet and back to normal activities.</P>
<P>With regard to adults, this review has not identified robust data on the best method to minimise discomfort, but we would expect a trial studying this aspect to report similar findings to those of <LINK REF="STD-Nunez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nunez 2000</LINK>. The results do not allow us to say whether adults experience more pain after tonsillectomy than children, but the time needed to recover is likely to be at least as long as in children. Indeed, our own experience suggests that it will be longer.</P>
<P>Microscopic bipolar tonsillectomy appears to be no faster than traditional dissection tonsillectomy. When performed without a microscope bipolar tonsillectomy may be faster but this review does not identify the evidence to confirm this. However, the information regarding operating time may be useful for planning operating lists.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-03 10:58:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from randomised controlled trials to support one method of tonsillectomy over another are currently lacking, particularly when considering haemorrhage rates. The combined data suggest that there is less intraoperative blood loss using diathermy dissection; this may be relevant for certain patients such as small children and infants. No differences were found in either the primary or secondary haemorrhage rates. This may reflect the fact that the studies were insufficiently powerful to pick up small differences in such rates. If 12-day analgesic consumption is used as a marker for postoperative pain, monopolar diathermy dissection appears to be more painful than cold dissection. However, this is not reflected in the time to resume normal activity levels and diet, which is about seven days for either method in paediatric patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-14 11:23:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More data are required to establish whether there is an important difference in pain or bleeding between bipolar diathermy tonsillectomy and traditional dissection. This would require a large, well designed randomised controlled trial to give adequate power and avoid the problems noted in this review. </P>
