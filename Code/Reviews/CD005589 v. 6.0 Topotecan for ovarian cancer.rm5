</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six studies including 1323 participants were eligible for this review (Gordon 2004a; Gore 2001a; Gore 2002; Hoskins 1998; Huinink 2004; Placido 2004) All studies, as reported, were identified as being of poor methodological quality. Topotecan had comparable effectiveness to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) compared with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), (16.1 weeks versus 17.0 weeks; p = 0.095). Overall survival (OS) time was similar in participants using PLD compared with topotecan (56.7 weeks versus 60 weeks; p = 0.341). Topotecan was more hematologically toxic compared with paclitaxel or PLD, relative risks (RRs) of hematological events: ranged from 1.03 to 14.46 and 1.73 to 27.12 respectively. A 21-day cycle of topotecan was more toxic than a 42-day cycle (RRs of hematological and non-hematological events ranged from 1.03 to 8). Intravenous and oral topotecan had comparable toxicity. Topotecan delayed progression more effectively compared with paclitaxel (23.1 weeks versus 14 weeks, p = 0.0021). Participants were more likely to respond to topotecan on a 21-day cycle as opposed to a 42-day cycle (RR 7.23, 95% CI 0.94 to 55.36). Small tumor diameter, sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with better prognosis. Small sample size, methodological flaws and poor reporting of the included trials made measurement bias of the trials difficult to assess.<BR/>

<P>Topotecan appears to have a similar level of effectiveness as paclitaxel and PLD, though with different patterns of side effects. Larger, well-designed RCTs are required in order to define an optimal regime. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-23 10:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Primary ovarian cancer begins in ovarian cells, including surface epithelial cells, germ cells, and sex cord-stromal cells. Approximately 85 to 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs) which are classified by different cell features under microscope into serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, Brenner, mixed, and undifferentiated carcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winter_x002d_Roach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter-Roach 2004</LINK>). Primary ovarian cancer is given a grade (1 to 3) and stage (I to IV). Grade 1 closely resembles normal tissue and tends to have a better prognosis than Grade 3. The stage of tumour spread can be ascertained during surgery (See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: FIGO Staging of Primary Ovarian Cancer).</P>
<P>Ovarian cancer accounts for approximately 3% of all cancer in women. A woman's risk of having ovarian cancer during her lifetime is 1.7% or about 1 in 58. Her lifetime chance of dying from ovarian cancer is 1 in 98. The median age at diagnosis is 63 years. The incidence increases with age and peaks in the eighth decade. Ovarian cancer ranks fourth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Due to the often asymptomatic nature of the early stages of the disease, almost 70% of women with common epithelial ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until the disease is at an advanced stage - i.e. has spread to the upper abdomen (stage III) or beyond (stage IV). The five year survival rate for these women is 15% to 20%, whereas the five year survival rate for stage I disease patients approaches 90% and for stage II approaches 70% (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOCC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOCC 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since stage IIb and IIc are often treated similarly to more advanced disease, a stricter definition of early stage disease may be all of stage I and stage IIa (<LINK REF="REF-Winter_x002d_Roach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter-Roach 2004</LINK>). Access to appropriate initial surgical management by a gynaecologic oncologist is important because treatment and survival are affected by appropriate surgical staging and debulking of the tumour. Patients with early stage, low-risk tumours may be cured with surgery alone (<LINK REF="REF-Hensley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensley 2002</LINK>). Current first-line management for advanced ovarian cancer consists of cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy, usually with a platinum/taxane combination. Although this approach has been shown to achieve overall response rates of 70% to 80% in clinical trials, the majority of patients relapse between 18 to 22 months later. Management of recurrent ovarian cancer remains a challenge to the clinician (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Goals for treating relapsed ovarian cancer include improving symptoms, enhancing quality of life (QOL), and prolonging survival. Agents that are potentially well suited for extended treatment intervals may include such properties as absence of cumulative toxicity, non cross resistance, positive benefit on QOL, and convenient schedule (<LINK REF="REF-Herzog-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herzog 2004</LINK>). Platines derivatives monotherapy (carboplatin) appears to be the most adequate treatment for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer (defined as having a response to initial chemotherapy administered for more than six months). Patients with platinum refractory as well as platinum sensitive advanced ovarian cancer can be considered for radiotherapy and new non platinum agents such as oral etoposide, topotecan, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, docetaxel and PLD depending on the stage of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ledermann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledermann 2004</LINK>). Of the agents available for the treatment of relapsed ovarian carcinoma, topotecan is one of the most widely studied and characterised (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Topotecan was semi-synthesized as a camptothecin derivative in 1990. It prevents DNA replication in cancer cells by inhibiting the enzyme topoisomerase I. The main toxicities associated with topotecan are haematological including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia; however, these toxicities are usually predictable, of short duration, noncumulative, and manageable with dose reduction and dose delay. Non haematological toxicity is generally mild and mainly consists of gastrointestinal events, hair loss and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Bokkel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bokkel 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Herzog-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herzog 2002</LINK>). The standard dosing regimen is 1.5 mg/m (2)/day on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle, with response rates ranging from 13% to 33%. Although the resulting hematologic toxicities are reversible and noncumulative, this schedule is associated with significant myelosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK>). Thus, in order to develop an optimal schedule of topotecan and to find a balanced point of its benefits and harms in treating ovarian cancer, new administration formulations of different doses, schedules and routes are explored by a number of studies such as weekly topotecan (<LINK REF="REF-Bhoola-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhoola 2004</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stathopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stathopoulos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stathopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stathopoulos 2004</LINK>), every two week topotecan (<LINK REF="REF-Kakolyris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakolyris 2001</LINK>), three day topotecan (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK>), oral topotecan (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke_x002d_Pearson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke-Pearson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2004</LINK>), decreased dosage (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>) and low dose continuous infusion of topotecan (<LINK REF="REF-Denschlag-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denschlag 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects of using topotecan as a therapeutic agent have not previously been systematically reviewed.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the role of topotecan in the management of ovarian cancer by considering the clinical efficacy and safety, its role in first and second line treatment and alternative administration formulations (dosage, route, schedule) to overcome toxicity.</P>

<P>Two review authors (PLH and WTX) scanned the titles and abstracts from the initial search. The full text of potentially relevant studies were then obtained for independent assessment of eligibility by both assessors. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third review author when necessary.</P>
<P>According to the empirical evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), we assessed the methodological quality as described by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 4.2.5 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Generation of allocation sequence: e.g. computer generated random numbers, coin tossed etc. - was regarded as adequate.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of treatment allocation schedule: e.g, by telephone randomization, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelops - was regarded as adequate.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (for clinician, participant, and outcome assessor).</LI>
<LI>Whether loss to follow-up was accounted for (no more than 20%); whether intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (understood to mean that participants were analysed in the groups to which they were initially assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received) was performed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We recorded problems in respect of these issues in full, and for individual studies each criteria was assigned a label of 'adequate', 'unclear' or 'inadequate'. It is acknowledged that blinding in some trials may be difficult to assess and therefore we placed the main emphasis on other methodological quality criteria.</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories:<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias</P>
<P>This classification was used as the basis for subgroup analysis. Each trial was assessed independently by two review authors (PLH and WTX). There were no disagreements recorded.</P>

For time to event data (overall and disease free survival) we planned to abstract the hazard ratio (HR) and its variance from trial reports; if these were not present, we attempted to abstract the data required to estimate them using Parmar's (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>) methods e.g. number of events in each arm and log-rank p-value comparing the relevant outcomes in each arm, or relevant data from Kaplan-Meier survival curves. If it was not possible to estimate the HR , we abstracted the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed, in order to estimate a relative risk (RR). If the number randomized and the numbers analyzed were inconsistent, we calculated the percentage loss-to-follow-up and reported this information in the text. For other binary outcomes such as adverse events, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event and the number of participants assessed in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, such as QOL, we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations for each group at the end of follow-up. If the data were reported using geometric means we extracted standard deviations on the log scale. Medians and ranges were extracted and reported in tables.</P>

<P>The data of long-term survival (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>) were obscured by the lack of reporting the follow-up durations, yet, according to the year the article was published, results of the follow-up should be considered over a five-year period. (Enrollment ended in 1999, and the long-term follow-up was published in 2004). The long-term follow-up used log-rank test to calculate HRs of survival, which was calculated as log HR in this review, results showed a trend in favour of PLD (log [HR]1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19) a similar trend was found in platinum-sensitive group of patients (log [HR] 1.17 ,95% CI 1.03 to 1.33), but not in the platinum-resistant one (log [HR] 1.03 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15). Median survival time at the end of follow-up is 59.7 weeks in the topotecan group and 62.7 weeks in the PLD group. When data were stratified by platinum sensitivity, platinum-sensitive participants in the topotecan group had median survival of 70.1 weeks and 107.9 weeks in the PLD group, in the platinum-resistant group, no significant difference was found (data not reported in original article).</P>

RRs for other hematological events ranged from 1.27 to 1.82 with revealing intervals (see RRs in analyses). As to non-hematological toxicity, more incidence of nausea, diarrhoea and alopecia were reported from intervention of a 21-day cycle (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98; RR 8.0, 95% CI 2.0 to 32.07; RR 2.08, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.27 respectively); no significant differences were found for lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, and stomatitis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topotecan versus non-treatment</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia of all grades were significantly lower than the counterparts of other trials using identical topotecan regimens. Similar trends were found for non-hematological toxicity, which could be partially explained by the characteristics of enrolled patients (The trial recruited stage IC to IV patients and the majority had a complete response to platinum-based chemotherapy) (<LINK REF="STD-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Placido 2004</LINK>). WHO criteria were used for toxicity evaluation while NCI criteria was used in other trials included in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intravenous topotecan versus oral topotecan</HEADING>
<P>Grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 3/4 leukopenia were more likely to occur when intravenous topotecan was used (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.32 and RR 1.25, CI 95% 1.11 to 1.41 respectively). Oral topotecan resulted in more frequent episodes of diarrhoea and vomiting (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73 and RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.94 respectively). No significant difference was reported for the incidence of other adverse events between the two arms (see RRs in analyses).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Symptom control</HEADING>
<P>The information of age, stage, tumor grade, severity status of conditions, residual tumor bulk, histology were provided in most trials however given the different interventions of different trials, few could be pooled. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>) stratified patients by bulky disease, yet, no significant difference was found in any outcome parameter. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2002</LINK>) comparing the effects of topotecan in participants with different tumor diameters, found no significant differences existed between intravenous and oral routes of administration in participants with different tumor sizes receiving the same intervention (intravenous or oral topotecan). <LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK> reported that participants with smaller tumor size were more likely to respond topotecan (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.34 to 7.14). Platinum-sensitive participants were more likely to respond to any intervention arm: overall response rate, irrespective of agents given, ranged from 19.0% to 35.7% in platinum-sensitive participants and from 6.78% to 13.3% of platinum-resistant participants. Survival time was also significantly longer in platinum-sensitive participants (with median survival time ranging from 63.4 to 107.9 weeks with any intervention) than in the platinum-resistant group (median survival time ranged from 28.4 to 71.9 weeks in any intervention arm) irrespective of the interventions given (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK>). The analysis of PFS in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>) yielded similar results:the platinum-sensitive participants had a median survival time ranging from 23.3 weeks to 28.9 weeks with any intervention,while the platinum-resistant patients had median survival time ranging from 9.1 weeks to 13.6 weeks.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>To date, six RCTs have compared the effect of topotecan with other chemotherapeutic agents. These trials provided insufficient evidence to determine whether the effect of topotecan on these outcomes differs greatly from other agents. In this review, except for the comparison of topotecan and paclitaxel using the data of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK>), which could be pooled, the fact that other pairs of comparison were found in only one trial rendered the meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis difficult.</P>
<P>The reporting of the methodological quality of the trials was of concern. The method of randomization was poorly reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>), the method of allocation concealment was also unclear or inadequate in two trials(<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>). Failure to conceal the allocation sequence could lead to biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). The choice of control was also inadequate, none of the studies used placebo as control, although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Placido 2004</LINK>) used non-treatment (observation). </P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>) did not report the percentage of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn from the trials, or the reasons for withdrawal. It is possible that participants' withdrawal was related to the effectiveness and safety of the agents, thus, undermining their methodological quality. As to ITT analysis , three out of six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK>) in which this principle was reported excluded randomized participants from the initial analysis thus, should be considered as inadequate. Most of the included trials were unblinded or did not report blinding of the intervention, which could result in reporting bias. Lastly, all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1998</LINK>) were funded by pharmaceutical companies or had contributors who received financial support from them. Pharmaceutical funding constitutes a potential conflict of interest and can introduce bias in terms of the study design, analysis, and reporting of unfavorable results (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another major flaw of the included trials was the reporting of outcomes. Most trials were underpowered to study survival as a primary outcome, trials often failed to report a measure of variability for time-to-event outcomes such as survival, time to progression (e.g. reporting median value and range not including standard deviation or CI). The lack of variability estimates largely limited the interpretation of the estimates and consequently, prevented their inclusion in this review. For the outcomes included in this review, PFS was mentioned only in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Placido 2004</LINK>); QOL was measured only in trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>), survival data on long-term follow-up were often reported by ambiguous time duration. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1998</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Placido 2004</LINK>) reported discontinuation and loss-to-follow-up information, discontinuation rate due to adverse events were hardly discussed: only one trial reported the percentage of patients withdraw from the trial due to adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>We interpreted results of this review as follows: <BR/>The effect of topotecan on PFS did not substantially differ from other agents. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>) reported similar results between two intervention arms (topotecan and PLD), even when stratified by platinum sensitivity, also by the presence of bulk diseases. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Placido 2004</LINK>) found no significant effect of topotecan on HR of PFS after responding to prior chemotherapy and surgery.</P>
<P>Participants recruited for the trials assessed in this review receiving topotecan had a median survival time of between 40 to 61.3 weeks at the conclusion of the trials and a median survival time of long term follow-up ranging from 59.7 weeks to 63 weeks. Platinum-resistant patients had only half of the median survival time of platinum sensitive patients, comparison of these outcomes was hampered by lack of uniformity in the reporting (e.g. survival curve and median time).</P>
<P>Topotecan had comparable effects on response rate as other agents and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>) which demonstrated no cross-over resistance between topotecan and paclitaxel. However, the small sample was hardly persuasive enough to support any definitive conclusion.</P>
<P>Topotecan was more toxic compared paclitaxel or PLD, the major concern for its use is its inclination to bring hematologically adverse events, different cycles were associated with different events. It should be noted that <LINK REF="STD-Placido-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Placido 2004</LINK> reported less adverse events than other five trials, which could be explained by the recruitment of FIGO IC to IV patients and the majority of participants had complete response to platinum-based chemotherapy plus the fact that WHO criteria were used for toxicity evaluation while NCI criteria was used in other three trials included of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gore-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Gore 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huinink-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huinink 2004</LINK>). The present evidence failed to prove whether topotecan in could prolong patients' survival, delay disease progression and improve QOL of patients with ovarian cancer to a greater extent than the other agents.</P>
<P>Our review had drawbacks in several aspects, first, our search was mainly restricted to trials published in English, good-quality articles in other language may be omitted and thus undermine the validity of the findings in this review. We extracted data from the published articles without further contact with the authors to get access to raw data which could be more readily interpreted into informative conclusions. Our strategy, which did not find grey literature (unpublished trials, or ongoing trials, confidential reports) may make this systematic review susceptible to publication bias. Considering the large number of trials other than RCTs studying topotecan at present, the inclusion of observational studies or non-controlled trials in other forms of systematic review might aid readers to get a more comprehensive view of this topic.</P>
<P>In clinical practice, topotecan is used as an established, efficacious agent for recurrent ovarian cancer, especially for patients who had responded poorly to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Swisher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swisher 1997</LINK>). It remains one of the single agents considered effective as a combination chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer especially for well-defined categories of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sessa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sessa 2005</LINK>). The established daily-times-five arm of a 21-day cycle is stable in term of efficacy (overall response rate) across the trials included in this review (ranging from 13.1% to 22.6%), and toxicity is generally tolerated and non-cumulative. QOL and symptom palliation should be considered when selecting chemotherapy for patients with late stage ovarian cancer. A continuous 21-day infusion of topotecan reportedly led to a response rate of 10.5% and 43% in two separate trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hochster-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochster 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1997</LINK>). Lastly, the adjunctive role of topotecan as first-line therapy needs additional investigation on the basis of studied published (<LINK REF="STD-Guppy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Guppy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hochster 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mirchandani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirchandani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiersten-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tiersten 2006</LINK>), all these innovative therapies should be translated into a well-designed, large-sampled RCTs.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>While topotecan is used frequently for the treatment of recurrent and advanced ovarian cancer, data from RCTs were inadequate to find possible differences in effectiveness and safety when compared with other agents. The present evidence implies that topotecan, as with other second line chemotherapeutic agents is an effective agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Larger RCTs comparing topotecan of established regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Berek-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berek 2000</LINK>) with other agents of different regimens are urgently required to further evaluate whether the effectiveness of topotecan is similar to or superior than other second-line agents, whether in single or combined use; or when combined with platinum-based treatments. Different routes, doses and schedules should be evaluated in these trials. Likewise, they should use standardized outcomes for reporting dichotomous, continuous and survival data with variability and informative statistical illustrations. The time of follow-up should be specified. The trials require careful design following the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
