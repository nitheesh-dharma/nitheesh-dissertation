<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The primary objective was to compare the effectiveness of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids started within the first week of life in preventing death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as requirement of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age) in infants on invasive mechanical ventilation with birth weight &#8804; 1500 g or gestational age &#8804; 32 weeks.
<BR/>

</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Preterm babies who require breathing support often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is thought that inflammation in the lungs may be part of the cause. Corticosteroid drugs when given orally or through a vein reduces this inflammation, but the use of corticosteroids is associated with serious side effects. Corticosteroids use has been associated with cerebral palsy (motor problem) and developmental delay. It is possible that inhaling steroids, so that the drug directly reaches the lung, may reduce the adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review looked at trials that compared preterm babies who received steroids by inhalation to those who received steroids systemically (through a vein or orally) while they were receiving mechanical ventilation. We included two trials that involved 294 infants. One study included 278 infants and the other study included 16 infants. No new studies were included for the 2017 update.</P>
<P>Both studies received grant support and the industry provided aero chambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the larger study. No conflict of interest was identified.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence that inhaling steroids compared to systemic steroids prevented the primary outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The number of days the baby needed mechanical ventilation support or additional oxygen were increased in infants who received inhaled steroids versus infants who received systemic steroids. These outcomes were reported in both the trials. The rate of patent ductus arteriosus (failure for the ductus arteriosus, an arterial shunt in fetal life, to close after birth) was increased in the group receiving inhaled steroids. There was a lower incidence of high blood sugars in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group. These secondary outcomes were reported in only one trial (the larger trial). In a sub-sample of 52 children at age 7 years there were no differences in long-term follow-up outcomes between the inhaled and the systemic steroid groups. in an even smaller sample of 48 infants the outcome of 'ever diagnosed as asthmatic by seven years of age' was significantly lower in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>According to GRADE the quality of the evidence was moderate to low.</P>

<P>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants and inflammation plays a significant role in its pathogenesis. The use of inhaled corticosteroids may modulate the inflammatory process without concomitant high systemic steroid concentrations and less risk of adverse effects. This is an update of a review published in 2012 (<A HREF="Shah 2012">Shah 2012</A>). We recently updated the related review on "Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for treating bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates".</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-13 17:22:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included two trials that involved 294 infants. No new studies were included for the 2017 update. The incidence of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was not statistically significantly different between infants who received inhaled or systemic steroids (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35; RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.16; 1 trial, N = 278). The incidence of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among survivors was not statistically significant between groups (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.90; RD 0.11, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.24; 1 trial, N = 206). There was no statistically significant difference in the outcomes of BPD at 28 days, death at 28 days or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and the combined outcome of death or BPD by 28 days between groups (2 trials, N = 294). The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group (typical MD 4 days, 95% CI 0.2 to 8; 2 trials, N = 294; I² = 0%) as was the duration of supplemental oxygen (typical MD 11 days, 95% CI 2 to 20; 2 trials, N = 294; I² = 33%).</P>
<P>The incidence of hyperglycaemia was significantly lower with inhaled steroids (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.71; RD -0.25, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14; 1 trial, N = 278; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 7 to avoid 1 infant experiencing hyperglycaemia). The rate of patent ductus arteriosus increased in the group receiving inhaled steroids (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.17; RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.33; 1 trial, N = 278; NNTH 5, 95% CI 3 to 10). In a subset of surviving infants in the United Kingdom and Ireland there were no significant differences in developmental outcomes at 7 years of age. However, there was a reduced risk of having ever been diagnosed as asthmatic by 7 years of age in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group (N = 48) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.94; RD -0.31, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.05; NNTB 3, 95% CI 2 to 20).</P>
<P>According to GRADE the quality of the evidence was moderate to low. Evidence was downgraded on the basis of design (risk of bias), consistency (heterogeneity) and precision of the estimates.</P>
<P>Both studies received grant support and the industry provided aero chambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the larger study. No conflict of interest was identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-13 17:22:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no evidence that early inhaled steroids confer important advantages over systemic steroids in the management of ventilator-dependent preterm infants. Based on this review inhaled steroids cannot be recommended over systemic steroids as a part of standard practice for ventilated preterm infants. Because they might have fewer adverse effects than systemic steroids, further randomised controlled trials of inhaled steroids are needed that address risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques, dosing schedules and long-term effects, with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-13 17:22:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the availability of antenatal corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2017</LINK>), surfactant replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bahadue-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahadue 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2002</LINK>) and other advances in neonatal intensive care, chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD) remains a substantial cause of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1994</LINK>). The incidence of BPD has an inverse relationship with both birth weight and gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinkin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinkin 1990</LINK>) and has increased partly due to improved survival of extremely low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1993</LINK>). Among survivors, BPD results in prolonged hospitalisation, an increased risk for rehospitalization and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
<P>There is increasing evidence from cellular and biochemical research that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Groneck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groneck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotecha-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotecha 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1992</LINK>). In many infants, the inflammatory reaction is evident shortly after birth suggesting that the process may have been triggered in utero (<LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 1996</LINK>). Postnatally, a number of factors may also initiate or aggravate this inflammatory process. These include baro or volume-trauma induced by mechanical ventilation, oxygen toxicity, infections and presence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Interventions aimed at reducing or modulating the inflammatory process may reduce the incidence or severity of BPD.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-16 10:59:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to their strong anti-inflammatory properties, systemic corticosteroids are being used clinically to reduce or limit the inflammatory process associated with development of BPD. The rationale for early administration of postnatal corticosteroids is that these drugs may prevent or minimise the inflammatory changes associated with mechanical ventilation and decrease the need for steroids later to treat BPD. Several systematic reviews on the use of postnatal systemic corticosteroids (early (&lt; 96 hours) and moderately early (7 to 14 days)) have demonstrated a reduction in BPD at 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (<LINK REF="REF-Arias_x002d_Camison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arias-Camison 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2001</LINK>). Marked heterogeneity of the doses and duration of dexamethasone therapy among trials has been noted.</P>
<P>There is growing concern that the beneficial effects on the pulmonary system may be negated by increased risk of short- and long-term adverse effects with corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1998</LINK>). Short-term serious complications with early systemic corticosteroid therapy include gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation, hyperglycaemia requiring insulin therapy and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 2001</LINK>). The potential effects on brain growth and neurodevelopment are the most alarming deficits. Two follow-up studies of early systemic corticosteroid administration have shown a two- to four-fold increase in neuromotor impairments in surviving dexamethasone-treated infants compared with controls at two years corrected age (<LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1998</LINK>). Meta-analysis has shown increased risk of cerebral palsy in infants treated early with dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In statements released by the European Association of Perinatal Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 2001b</LINK>), the American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 2012</LINK>) and the Canadian Pediatric Society (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferies 2012</LINK>) routine use of systemic dexamethasone for the prevention or treatment of BPD is not recommended. Outside the context of randomised controlled trials, the use of corticosteroids should be limited to exceptional clinical circumstances. These recommendations were based on concerns regarding short and long-term complications, especially cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>Theoretically, the use of inhaled corticosteroids may allow for beneficial effects on the pulmonary system without concomitant high systemic concentrations and less risk of adverse effects. Results of a large multi centre study of early use of inhaled steroids concluded that among extremely preterm infants, the incidence of BPD was lower among those who received early inhaled budesonide than among those who received placebo, but the advantage may have been gained at the expense of increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2015</LINK>). The results of this study have been included in a Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017a</LINK>) and a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2016</LINK> concluded "Very preterm infants appear to benefit from inhaled corticosteroids with reduced risk for BPD and no effect on death, other morbidities, or adverse events. Data on long-term respiratory, growth, and developmental outcomes are eagerly awaited". <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017a</LINK> summarized the results of their Cochrane Review: "There is increasing evidence from the trials reviewed that early administration of inhaled steroids to very low birth weight neonates is effective in reducing the incidence of death or chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among either all randomised infants or among survivors. Even though there is statistical significance, the clinical relevance is of question as the upper CI limit for the outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age is infinity. The long-term follow-up results of the <LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2015</LINK> study may affect the conclusions of this review. Further studies are needed to identify the risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for the administration of these medications. Studies need to address both the short- and long-term benefits and adverse effects of inhaled steroids with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome". It is noteworthy that a Cochrane Review by <LINK REF="REF-Onland-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onland 2017b</LINK> concluded: "Despite the fact that some studies reported a modulating effect of treatment regimens in favour of higher-dosage regimens on the incidence of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment, recommendations on the optimal type of corticosteroid, the optimal dosage, or the optimal timing of initiation for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants cannot be made based on current level of evidence. A well-designed large RCT is urgently needed to establish the optimal systemic postnatal corticosteroid dosage regimen". Apart from the studies included in this review, we are not aware of any other direct comparisons of early use of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-13 17:22:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is thought that inflammation in the lungs may be part of the cause of BPD. As part of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of early inhaled beclomethasone therapy, <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK> measured interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) concentrations in tracheal aspirates as markers of pulmonary inflammation. Beclomethasone-treated infants with moderately elevated baseline IL-8 levels received less subsequent systemic glucocorticoid therapy and had a lower incidence of BPD than non treated infants. <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK> and co-authors concluded that early-inhaled beclomethasone therapy was associated with a reduction in pulmonary inflammation after one week of therapy. Corticosteroid drugs when given orally or intravenously reduces this inflammation in the lungs. However, the use of corticosteroids is associated with serious side effects. Its use has been associated with cerebral palsy and developmental delay. Inhaling steroids, so that the drug directly reaches the lung, has been tried as a way to limit adverse effects.</P>

<P>We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence. The following (clinically relevant) outcomes were assessed among all randomised infants using GRADE: primary outcome - death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among all randomised. Secondary outcomes: death or BPD at 28 days; BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; BPD at 28 days; duration of mechanical ventilation; duration of supplemental oxygen; hyperglycaemia; and patent ductus arteriosus. The following secondary outcomes were assessed among survivors; BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; BPD at 28 days and ever diagnosed as asthmatic at seven years of age.</P>
<P>Three authors (SS, AO, VS) independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from randomised controlled trials as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades:</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Groneck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Groneck 1999</LINK> was a open comparative trial which enrolled preterm infants &lt; 1200 g while they were mechanically ventilated and had fractional inspired oxygen (FiO&#8322;) requirement &gt; 0.3 on the third day of life. Sixteen infants were enrolled into the study and were alternatively allocated to treatment with inhaled beclomethasone or systemic dexamethasone. Due to poor clinical results (BPD in 6/7 infants), alternate allocation to inhaled steroids was stopped for ethical reasons after inhaled steroid treatment of seven infants. Thus, seven infants were treated with inhaled steroids and nine received systemic steroids. Inhaled beclomethasone was given from day three to day 28 of life administered by an aero chamber into the ventilatory circuit at a dose of 3 x 2 puffs of 250 µg (= 1.5 mg/day). After extubation, inhalation therapy was continued by face mask, and the aero chamber was connected to a ventilation bag. No systemic steroids were given to infants treated with inhaled steroids during the first month of life. Systemic dexamethasone was given at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day for three days, starting between days 11 to 13; thereafter the dose was gradually tapered over 10 to 28 days, according to clinical status of the infant. Duration of systemic steroids was at the discretion of attending physician. Primary outcome was assessment of lung inflammation and lung permeability. Other outcome measures were days on mechanical ventilation, days on supplemental oxygen and BPD (oxygen dependency and radiological abnormalities on day 28). Pulmonary inflammation and lung permeability were assessed by analysing inflammatory mediators (interleukin -8, elastase alpha -1 proteinase inhibitor, free elastase, secretory component for IgA and albumin) in tracheal aspirates on day 10 (before starting dexamethasone) and day 14 (three days after starting dexamethasone). The baseline characteristics were similar between groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001a</LINK> enrolled infants born at &lt; 30 weeks' gestation, postnatal age &lt; 72 hours and needing mechanical ventilation and FiO&#8322; &gt; 0.30. Infants of 30 and 31 weeks could be included if they needed FiO&#8322; &gt; 0.50. Infants with lethal congenital anomalies, severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 3 or 4) and proven systemic infection before entry were excluded from the trial. The trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of early (&lt; 72 hours) and delayed (&gt; 15 days) administration of systemic dexamethasone and inhaled budesonide. Infants were randomly allocated to one of four treatment policies in a factorial design: early (&lt; 72 hours) dexamethasone, early budesonide, delayed selective (&gt; 15 days) dexamethasone and delayed selective budesonide. Only the groups allocated to early budesonide or early dexamethasone are included in this review. Budesonide was administered by metered dose inhaler and a spacing chamber in a dose of 400 µg/kg twice daily for 12 days. Dexamethasone was given intravenously (IV) or orally in a tapering course beginning with 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for three days reducing by half every three days for a total of 12 days of therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001a</LINK> reported that 143 infants were randomised to the early budesonide group and 135 were randomised to the early dexamethasone group. Of 143 infants randomised to early budesonide, 53 received full course, 87 received partial course, and three did not receive budesonide. Of 135 infants randomised to early dexamethasone, 53 received a full course, 76 received a partial course and six infants did not receive dexamethasone. The primary outcome was death or oxygen dependency at 36 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included death or major cerebral abnormality, duration of oxygen treatment, duration of assisted ventilation, duration of hospitalisation, death or oxygen dependency at 28 days and complications of preterm birth. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Additional data were obtained from the authors for the outcomes of duration of ventilation and duration of supplemental oxygen (expressed as mean and SD). A subset of the infants enrolled in the OSECT study (<LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001a</LINK>) has been followed to a median age of seven years; 127 (84%) of 152 survivors born in the United Kingdom and Ireland were followed; of these 52 infants belonged to the early dexamethasone and early budesonide groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-13 17:22:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review demonstrated that early use of inhaled steroids is not associated with any significant difference in the incidence of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or at 28 days of age compared with the early use of systemic steroids. We found no evidence that inhaled steroids decrease the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or at 28 days of age compared to systemic steroids. Inhaled steroid use compared with systemic steroids use was associated with increase in the incidence of PDA, longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer duration of supplemental oxygen. Inhaled steroid use compared with systemic corticosteroid use was associated with decrease in the incidence hyperglycaemia and in the incidence of children ever diagnosed as asthmatic by age seven years. In a subgroup of 52 infants there were no significant differences in other long-term outcomes at seven years of age.</P>
<P>We found no evidence that early inhaled steroids confer important advantages over systemic steroids in the management of ventilated preterm infants. Further studies need to be performed before early steroids, either inhaled or systemic, can be recommended as safe for prevention of BPD in preterm infants. Only a small sample of infants have been followed to seven years of age with no differences observed between the inhaled and systemic steroid groups.</P>
<P>Both studies received grant support and the industry provided aero chambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the larger study. No conflict of interest was identified.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-13 17:22:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An intriguing observation made by <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001a</LINK> was the statistically significant decrease in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in infants treated with systemic compared with inhaled steroids. Use of antenatal corticosteroids has shown to decrease the PDA incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Aghajafari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aghajafari 2001</LINK>). Early postnatal dexamethasone therapy in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has been shown to decrease the incidence of PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Heyman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyman 1990</LINK> proposed that closure of PDA could be achieved by dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids may have an effect on PDA through an interference in prostaglandin synthesis or through a reduction in sensitivity of ductal muscle to prostaglandin E2 (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the current review, hyperglycaemia was less common in the inhaled steroid group. There was a decrease in the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and gastrointestinal perforation in the inhaled steroid group which was of borderline statistical significance. There were no significant differences in incidences of other adverse effects between the groups. Overall, it would appear that inhaled steroids are less likely to have short-term adverse effects than systemic steroids. However, data from long-term follow-up studies are needed before use of inhaled steroids can be said to be preferable to systemic steroids. Early use of inhaled versus systemic steroids cannot presently be recommended for the prevention of BPD in the preterm infant.</P>
<P>Another major concern with studies of inhaled steroid therapy is the uncertainty regarding drug delivery and deposition in the oropharynx and in the peripheral airways. Numerous factors affect drug delivery and deposition including the number of particles in the respirable range, the delivery technique (use of metered dose inhalers with or without a spacer, nebulizers (jet or ultrasonic)) and the presence or absence of an endotracheal tube. Previous reports have shown that the amount of aerosol delivery varies from 0.4% to 14% based on the technique used (<LINK REF="REF-Arnon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnon 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 1992</LINK>). Some studies have suggested that the delayed onset of activity (<LINK REF="STD-Dimitriou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dimitriou 1997</LINK>) and similar risk profile of inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2003</LINK>) are consistent with their effects being secondary to systemic absorption.</P>
<P>Identification of an effective dose of inhaled steroids and improvements in drug delivery systems guaranteeing selective delivery in the alveoli and smaller airways may improve the clinical efficacy and decrease the side-effect profile of inhalational steroids.</P>

<P>Systematic reviews of early postnatal systemic corticosteroids (&lt; 7 days of age) versus placebo or no treatment have shown a significant decrease in the incidence of BPD and the combined outcome of BPD and death at 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2001</LINK>). A borderline increased risk of periventricular leukomalacia was noted in the infants who received dexamethasone. In the reviews of systemic postnatal corticosteroid therapy administered after seven days of age a decrease in the combined outcome of BPD at 36 weeks and mortality was shown (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2001</LINK>). There was no evidence that the duration of hospitalisation or need for supplemental oxygen was decreased (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2001</LINK>). Early administration of inhaled steroids in the first two weeks of life to ventilated very low birth weight infants showed no evidence of decrease in the incidence of BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017a</LINK>). However, there was increasing evidence from the trials reviewed that early administration of inhaled steroids to very low birth weight neonates was effective in reducing the incidence of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among either all randomised infants or among survivors.</P>

<P>The protocol was not published. For this update on the advice of the Neonatal Cochtrsnr Neonatal Editorial team the primary outcome was changed to death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and steroids should be started in the first seven days of life. Similarily chronic lung disease was changed to bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the title and the text. With change in the primary outcome changes to the secondary outcomes were necessary. Death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was added. A subset (127/152, 84%) of infants born in the UK and Ireland enrolled in the OSECT study (<LINK REF="STD-Halliday-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 2001a</LINK>) has been followed to a median age of seven years. A post hoc analyses of these infants have been newly included in this review after availability of the data since long term-follow up information is very important. Clinically important secondary outcomes have been described more elaborately in this update. If further studies were to be performed, this would help the researchers identify the areas of need. </P>

<P>1. Budesonide was administered using a metered dose inhaler (MDI; 200 µg/puff; Pulmicort, Astra Draco, Lund, Sweden) connected to spacing device (Aerochamber MV 15; Trudell Medical, Canada). The aero chamber was a rigid, clear plastic cylinder, 11 by 4.1 cm with an approximate capacity of 145 mL. After endotracheal suctioning, the MDI was shaken and inserted into the spacing chamber. The spacer was then filled with 100% oxygen and infant's FiO&#8322; was increased by 20%. The aero chamber was connected into the ventilatory circuit and manual inflations were given through the chamber using an inflatable bag. Budesonide was administered as soon as chest wall movements were established. A 500 to 1000 g infant was given 2 puffs twice daily and a 1000 to 1500 g infant was given 3 puffs twice daily. The puffs were given one at a time, activating MDI at end expiration and allowing 10 breaths after each activation. After each administration, the chamber was removed from the ventilator circuit and the infant was reconnected to the ventilator at the previous settings. The duration of budesonide treatment was up to 12 days provided the infant remained intubated. If the infant was extubated before 12 days budesonide was discontinued.</P>
<P>2. Dexamethasone was administered IV or orally in initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days, followed by 0.25 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days, then 0.10 mg/kg/day for 3 days, and finally 0.05 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days.

<P>For previous versions of the review, randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled versus systemic corticosteroid therapy in preterm infants were identified from MEDLINE (1966 to 2011) using MeSH headings: infant-newborn, chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, anti-inflammatory agents, steroids; dexamethasone, administration, inhalation; aerosols, budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, flunisolide and fluticasone propionate.</P>
<P>Other databases were searched including: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 6, 2011), Embase (1980 to 2011), CINAHL (1982 to 2011), reference lists of published trials and abstracts published in Pediatric Research or electronically on the Pediatric Academic Societies web site (1990 to 2011). No language restrictions were applied.</P>
<P>For the 2011 update, we searched Clinicaltrials.gov, Controlled-trials.com and Web of Science, which were not searched for previous reviews.</P>

<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of the trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation, and the blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved any disagreement by discussion. We added this information to <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the risk of bias table:</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>b. High risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>b. High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</P>
<P>b. Low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>b. High risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>b. High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>b. High risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk;</P>
<P>b. High risk;</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk</P>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
