<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-04-08 19:27:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several different surgical techniques for early termination of pregnancy (abortion in the first three months). These are dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C to scrape out the contents of the uterus), vacuum aspiration (sucking out the contents of the uterus with a manual or power-operated device). Hysterotomy (surgery through the uterus, like caesarean section) is not commonly used. The cervix (opening of the uterus) can be prepared beforehand with hormones to minimise the risk of damage. The review found that both, D&amp;C and vacuum aspiration, are safe and effective methods for first trimester termination of pregnancy and complications are rare. The review does not reveal women's or surgeons' preference of one method over the other.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-30 17:52:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Different surgical methods for termination of pregnancy have evolved over the years: Dilatation and curettage, power operated vacuum aspiration (VA), manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or hysterotomy. Local or general anaesthesia is used for all methods. Preabortion medical or mechanical cervical preparation may reduce the incidence of cervical or uterine injuries.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register has been searched. A search of the reference lists of identified trials was performed. An additional MEDLINE search was done using the Internet search service Pub Med.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical methods for first trimester abortion were eligible.</P>

<P>Trials under consideration were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion. Eleven trials were included, resulting in 3 comparisons: 1) vacuum aspiration versus dilatation and curettage, 2) flexible versus rigid vacuum aspiration cannula, 3) manual vacuum aspiration versus electrical vacuum aspiration. Results are reported as risk ratio for dichotomous data and weighted mean differences for continuous data.</P>

In women with amenorrhoea &gt; 9 weeks, severe difficulty of the procedure was reported more frequently with MVA compared to VA ( RR 5.7; 95%CI 2.45 to 13.28).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-03-30 19:25:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complications for surgical first trimester abortion are rare. The included studies do not indicate overall benefits of one over the other method. MVA can be used for early first trimester surgical abortion, but maybe more difficult when used later in the first trimester. Duration of procedure is shorter with VA compared to D&amp;C, which may be of importance when using local anaesthetics or for busy clinics. Outcomes such as women's satisfaction, the need for pain relief or surgeons preference for the instrument have been inadequately addressed. No long-term outcomes, such as fertility after surgical abortion, are available.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-01 15:19:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Every year about 36-53 million unwanted pregnancies are terminated by induced abortion throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Henshaw--1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henshaw 1990</LINK>). The exact number is not known, as statistics on induced abortion are not always reliable due to underreporting, and as there is no satisfactory method to estimate the number of unsafe abortions. It is estimated that 30-50% of all women undergo at least one induced abortion during their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Look-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Look 1993</LINK>).<BR/>Currently, some 63% of the world's population live in countries where abortion is available on request or where psycho-social factors are accepted as a valid indication. Deaths due to unsafe abortion are associated with infection, haemorrhage, uterine injury and the toxic effects of agents taken by mouth or injected into the uterus to induce abortion.</P>
<P>While induced abortion is safe in countries where the procedure is legal and appropriate services are widely available, the risk of suffering serious complications and perhaps death is considerable where the operation is performed by unqualified people under unhygienic conditions. Deaths related to unsafe abortions represent about one-fourth to one third of the estimated 500,000 maternal deaths that occur each year throughout the world, the vast majority in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Royston-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royston 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, morbidity following the procedure seems to increase with the length of gestation. The likelihood of complications, including uterine perforation, cervical laceration, haemorrhage, incomplete removal of the fetus and placenta, and infection increases after the first trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1997</LINK>). Surgical abortion at 7-9 weeks of gestation is associated with statistically significantly fewer complications than that performed at 9-14 weeks of amenorrhoea or in the second trimester. Complications are slightly more common up to 6 weeks of amenorrhoea than from 7 to 9 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Heisterberg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heisterberg 1987</LINK>).<BR/>Serious complications such as infections or haemorrhage, have been described more frequently in parous women and with increasing age (<LINK REF="REF-Buehler-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buehler 1985</LINK>). Within countries, morbidity rates decreased over the past 10-15 years as abortion has been provided earlier in pregnancy, better techniques have been developed and clinicians have become more skilled (<LINK REF="REF-Am-Med-Ass-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Am Med Ass 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical methods for termination of pregnancy are described below.<BR/>Dilatation and curettage: the cervix is dilated until a forceps or curette of appropriate diameter can be inserted to remove the contents of the uterus. In some cases a sponge-holding forceps is used to remove larger parts of the contents.<BR/>Dilatation and electric vacuum aspiration: the cervix is dilated until a cannula of appropriate size can be inserted. The contents of the uterus are removed by suction through power operated vacuum aspiration. In some cases additional curettage of the uterus is performed.<BR/>Local or general anaesthesia is used for both methods. Preabortion medical or mechanical cervical preparation may reduce the incidence of cervical or uterine injuries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1981</LINK>).<BR/>Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA): this is a uterine evacuation procedure using a hand-held vacuum syringe. Uterine contents are evacuated through a cannula into the syringe; local anaesthesia is commonly used (<LINK REF="REF-Gutmacher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutmacher 1999</LINK>).<BR/>If all procedures fail, then hysterotomy, although rarely used, might be performed to empty the contents of the uterus as a last resort.<BR/>This review aims to compare the safety and efficacy of different surgical methods for first trimester abortion.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The Cochrane Controlled Trials register and MEDLINE were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved papers were searched.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-03-01 11:14:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The selection of trials for inclusion in the review has been performed independently by two authors after employing the search strategy described previously. Trials under consideration were evaluated for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results. A score for concealment of allocation was assigned to each trial, using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation (includes quasi-randomised studies)</P>
<P>Only trials scoring A or B were included in the review.</P>
<P>A form was designed to facilitate the process of data extraction which was performed by two reviewers independently. No discrepancies between reviewers in either the decision of inclusion/exclusion of studies or in data extraction occurred. Settings, countries, post randomisation exclusions and loss to follow-up data were systematically extracted. Data extraction for four publications in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Gan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gan 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2004</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2005</LINK>) was performed by one author (LC). <BR/>Data were processed by using RevMan software.</P>
<P>Trials were not excluded based on an arbitrary cut-off limit regarding losses to follow-up. Trials would be excluded if there are unexplained imbalances in different groups at follow-up and available outcome data. Subgroup analysis was performed for early and late first trimester abortions as the performance of some methods may differ with gestational age: (1) termination &lt; 9 weeks of pregnancy (&lt; 63 days), (2) termination =/&gt; 9 weeks of pregnancy (=/&gt; 63 days).</P>

<P>There were no reports of maternal deaths.<BR/>Two trials compared vacuum aspiration with dilatation and curettage:<BR/>There were no statistically significant differences in excessive blood loss, blood transfusion, febrile morbidity, incomplete or repeat uterine evacuation procedure, re-hospitalisation, postoperative abdominal pain or therapeutic antibiotic use. Duration of operation was statistically significantly shorter with vacuum aspiration compared to D&amp;C in both subgroups : &lt; 9 weeks: weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.84 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-2.542 to -1.138]; =/&gt; 9 weeks: WMD -0.600 minutes, 95% CI [-1.166 to -0.034]).<BR/>There were no statistically significant differences with regard to cervical injuries, febrile morbidity, blood transfusion, therapeutic antibiotic use, or incomplete or repeat uterine evacuation procedure in the Borko trial, comparing flexible versus rigid vacuum aspiration cannula (<LINK REF="STD-Borko-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Borko 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>In women with &lt; 9 weeks amenorrhoea, uterine perforation occurred more often with VA compared to MVA in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2005</LINK>) but not in the other trials reporting on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Gan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gan 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hemlin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hemlin 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004)</LINK> (RR 0.06; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.01). Severe pain was more often reported with VA compared to MVA in women with &lt; 9 weeks of amenorrhoea ( RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.16); there was no difference in women with amenorrhoea &gt; 9 weeks for this outcome.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-04-27 08:50:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review focuses on efficacy and safety of different surgical abortion methods.<BR/>The interpretation needs to take into consideration that the outcomes are based on small sample sizes, sometimes on one trial only. Mortality or major complications seem to be rare with the described methods, requiring a large sample size to detect meaningful differences. Serious complications such as mortality or perforation of the uterus are rare events and seem to be impractical for studying in randomised controlled trials. Nevertheless, the power of the review is rather limited even with more common outcomes. Furthermore, the methodological quality of the trials is not high. Insecure allocation concealment, when two different allocation procedures which are impossible to mask are compared, can introduce serious selection bias.<BR/>In a large multicentre cohort study, data from over 4400 women undergoing first trimester vacuum aspiration or D&amp;C were analysed. The total complication rate varied with the gestational age and the method used. Vacuum aspiration was associated with lower rates of complications at 7 to 8 weeks gestation, similar rates at 9 to 12 weeks and higher rates after 12 weeks when compared to D&amp;C. Major complication rates such as excessive blood loss, uterine injury, prolonged bleeding and repeat curettage and pelvic infection were higher in both groups with increased gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1974</LINK>). VA was associated with higher repeat evacuation rates at all gestational ages.<BR/>In most trials included, the procedures were performed by experienced surgeons. In practice, however, surgical abortions are usually performed by junior staff and often unsupervised. Therefore, the complication rates may be higher. Edelman (<LINK REF="STD-Edelman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) found that both, pain and duration of operation may be less with more experienced operators.<BR/>D&amp;C continues to be used in many countries.The statistically significant reduction in operating time with vacuum aspiration (1.8 minutes) compared to D&amp;C may be of importance for women undergoing the operation under local anaesthesia. Hand-held syringes for MVA are inexpensive, require little maintenance and can be the method of choice for early surgical abortion in resource restrained settings.</P>

<P>Complications with first trimester surgical abortions are rare. The included studies do not indicate overall benefits of one over the other method. The choice which method to use depends on the setting and the availability of the equipment. MVA can be used for early first trimester surgical abortion, but maybe more difficult when used later in the first trimester. Duration of procedure is shorter with VA compared to D&amp;C, which may be of importance when using local anaesthetics or for busy clinics.</P>
