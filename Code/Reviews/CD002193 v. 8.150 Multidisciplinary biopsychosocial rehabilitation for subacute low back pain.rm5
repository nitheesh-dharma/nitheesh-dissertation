<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The previous version of this review (based on two included studies) (<LINK REF="REF-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>) found evidence in favour of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) for subacute low back pain. The authors concluded that MBR helped participants to return to work faster, resulted in fewer episodes of sick leave and alleviated subjective disability. In the current update (based on nine included studies), we also found evidence in support of MBR for return to work, sick leave, pain intensity, and disability, but only in comparison to usual care. When comparing MBR to other treatments, there was no benefit of MBR. Moreover, using up-to-date methods for grading the quality of the evidence, we determined that these findings were based on mainly low to very low-quality evidence, indicating that additional high-quality studies were needed before we could draw any definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of MBR for subacute low back pain.</P>

<P>
<B>Review Question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of multidisciplinary treatments on pain, disability, and work status among people who had been experiencing low back pain for six to 12 weeks. We defined multidisciplinary treatments as treatments that target physical as well as psychological or social aspects of low back pain and involve a team of healthcare providers with different professional backgrounds and training. For example, a treatment that integrated exercise therapy provided by a physiotherapist with workplace adjustments provided by an ergonomist, a specialist in the design and setup of workplace equipment, would be considered to be multidisciplinary.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Low back pain (LBP) is a condition that causes a great deal of pain and suffering across the world and also accounts for large costs to society due to healthcare spending and missed work. Previous research has shown that people who have back pain for more than three months are less likely to recover. As a result, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of intervening at the early stages of LBP.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to discover whether multidisciplinary treatments were better or worse than other alternatives, such a usual care (i.e. current clinical practice) or other treatments (e.g. exercise therapy alone) for people experiencing low back pain for six to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The search is current to July of 2016.</P>
<P>Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. The majority of studies included mixed samples of male and female participants. The authors had no concerns about funding sources of any included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, we found that multidisciplinary treatments may be better than usual care for people with LBP for a duration of six to 12 weeks. Individuals receiving multidisciplinary treatment had less pain, less disability, increased likelihood of return-to-work and fewer sick leave days at 12-month follow-up. However, when comparing multidisciplinary treatments to other treatments (e.g. brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise), we found that multidisciplinary treatments may be no better than other treatments. Although we examined adverse events as a secondary outcome, none of the included studies reported this outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for this review was generally low to very low. This was mainly due to small sample sizes and other study limitations. Moreover, we grouped together studies with differing interventions and comparisons. For example, some of the multidisciplinary interventions were quite intense (e.g. &gt; 30 hours of treatment), whereas others were designed to be brief (e.g. &lt; three hours). This variability across studies makes it more challenging to interpret the findings.</P>
<P>In sum, there is a need for additional, large, high-quality randomised controlled trials before we can make definitive recommendations for clinical practice.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-05-27 19:02:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-24 08:26:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low back pain (LBP) is associated with enormous personal and societal burdens, especially when it reaches the chronic stage of the disorder (pain for a duration of more than three months). Indeed, individuals who reach the chronic stage tend to show a more persistent course, and they account for the majority of social and economic costs. As a result, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of intervening at the early stages of LBP.</P>
<P>According to the biopsychosocial model, LBP is a condition best understood with reference to an interaction of physical, psychological, and social influences. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target factors from the different domains, administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds.</P>
<P>This review is an update of a Cochrane Review on MBR for subacute LBP, which was published in 2003. It is part of a series of reviews on MBR for musculoskeletal pain published by the Cochrane Back and Neck Group and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group.<BR/>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-09-17 19:33:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To examine the effectiveness of MBR for subacute LBP (pain for a duration of six to 12 weeks) among adults, with a focus on pain, back-specific disability, and work status.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-24 08:22:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for relevant trials in any language by a computer-aided search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and two trials registers. Our search is current to 13 July 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-24 08:22:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with subacute LBP. We included studies that investigated a MBR program compared to any type of control intervention. We defined MBR as an intervention that included a physical component (e.g. pharmacological, physical therapy) in combination with either a psychological, social, or occupational component (or any combination of these). We also required involvement of healthcare professionals from at least two different clinical backgrounds with appropriate training to deliver the component for which they were responsible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-27 19:02:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In particular, the data extraction and 'risk of bias' assessment were conducted by two people, independently. We used the Cochrane tool to assess risk of bias and the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-24 08:26:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included a total of nine RCTs (981 participants) in this review. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years.</P>
<P>All included studies were judged as having high risk of performance bias and high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding, and four of the nine studies suffered from at least one additional source of possible bias.</P>
<P>In MBR compared to usual care for subacute LBP, individuals receiving MBR had less pain (four studies with 336 participants; SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.21, moderate-quality of evidence due to risk of bias) and less disability (three studies with 240 participants; SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.01, low-quality of evidence due to risk of bias and inconsistency), as well as increased likelihood of return-to-work (three studies with 170 participants; OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 6.98, very low-quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision) and fewer sick leave days (two studies with 210 participants; SMD -0.38 95% CI -0.66 to -0.10, low-quality of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) at 12-month follow-up. The effect sizes for pain and disability were low in terms of clinical meaningfulness, whereas effects for work-related outcomes were in the moderate range.</P>
<P>However, when comparing MBR to other treatments (i.e. brief intervention with features from a light mobilization program and a graded activity program, functional restoration, brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise, and psychological counselling), we found no differences between the groups in terms of pain (two studies with 336 participants; SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), functional disability (two studies with 345 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.18, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), and time away from work (two studies with 158 participants; SMD -0.25 95% CI -0.98 to 0.47, very low-quality evidence due to serious imprecision, inconsistency and risk of bias). Return-to-work was not reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>Although we looked for adverse events in both comparisons, none of the included studies reported this outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-24 08:26:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On average, people with subacute LBP who receive MBR will do better than if they receive usual care, but it is not clear whether they do better than people who receive some other type of treatment. However, the available research provides mainly low to very low-quality evidence, thus additional high-quality trials are needed before we can describe the value of MBP for clinical practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-28 17:34:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-27 19:02:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low back pain (LBP) is a common condition worldwide, with a one-month prevalence in the general population of approximately 23% (<LINK REF="REF-Hoy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoy 2012</LINK>). In the latest Global Burden of Disease Study, LBP was identified as the leading cause of disability globally (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2015</LINK>). It was estimated to be responsible for 72.3 million years lived with disability in 2013, which represents a 57% increase from 1990. In addition to the huge personal toll for individuals and their families, LBP is associated with an enormous societal burden. These costs include healthcare expenditures, as well as the indirect costs related to inability to work or reduced productivity while at work (<LINK REF="REF-Dagenais-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagenais 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maetzal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Research evidence indicates that the majority of people presenting to healthcare providers with LBP will recover within a few weeks, but a quarter to a third continue to report LBP after 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Hayden-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 2010</LINK>). People who reach the chronic stage of LBP (pain for a duration of more than three months) tend to show a more persistent course (<LINK REF="REF-Pengel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayden-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 2010</LINK>); over 50% of these people are not recovered one year later (<LINK REF="REF-Menezes-Costa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menezes Costa 2009</LINK>). Indeed, it is the small proportion of people with persistent and disabling LBP that account for the majority of social and economic costs (<LINK REF="REF-Frymoyer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frymoyer 1991</LINK>). As a result, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of intervening before symptoms have reached the chronic stage (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2011</LINK>). Therefore, in the current review, we focus on subacute LBP, which is defined as back pain with a duration of six to 12 weeks.<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-28 17:34:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs acknowledge that although an anatomical or physiological problem can contribute to back pain, psychological factors such as fear, anxiety, mood disturbance, and a tendency to catastrophise may amplify or prolong pain (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2012</LINK>). Similarly, social/environmental factors such as physical job demands, workplace social support, and expectations for resuming work affect long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2009</LINK>). These insights have led to the design of interventions to address multiple factors, typically involving a combination of physical, psychological, social and/or work-related components which are often delivered by a team of clinicians with different skills (<LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK>). Over time, there has been an increase in research into the multidisciplinary approach due to wider acceptance of the biopsychosocial model (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2011</LINK>), the ineffectiveness of monotherapies (i.e. the use of single treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-Artus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artus 2010</LINK>), and promising reports from clinical practice. Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) may be delivered in multidisciplinary pain clinics, rehabilitation centres, or outpatient settings.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-27 18:59:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The theoretical basis for the intervention comes from the biopsychosocial model (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1987</LINK>). According to this theory, chronic LBP involves impairments of physical, psychological and social functioning, and effective treatment requires intervention that specifically addresses these problems. Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation includes elements aimed at improving back-related physical dysfunction as well as addressing psychological issues or targeting social or work-related behaviours, or any combination of these.</P>
<P>A large Cochrane Review by Kamper and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2014</LINK>) found evidence in support of MBR for chronic LBP. They found that participants with chronic LBP receiving multidisciplinary biopsychosocial treatment generally experienced less pain and disability than those receiving usual care or a physical treatment. Although it's unclear whether these effects generalize to the subacute stage of the disorder, accumulating evidence points to the importance of early intervention. Specifically, we know that biopsychosocial risk factors play a role in the transition to chronic LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2011</LINK>), thus interventions that target these factors in the early stages of LBP may be particularly effective and important to examine.<BR/>
</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-24 08:26:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although promising, it is notable that multidisciplinary treatments are labor-intensive, and their availability, time demands, and costs are important barriers for healthcare providers and consumers (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 2015</LINK>). The most recent Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial treatments among individuals with subacute LBP was published over ten years ago and included only two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>), thus a careful review of the current state of the literature is long overdue.<BR/>

<P>We included a total of nine RCTs in this review. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. The majority of studies included mixed samples of male and female participants (% female ranged from approximately 40% to 60%). However, both <LINK REF="STD-Campello-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Campello 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Slater-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Slater 2009</LINK> included mainly male participants (&lt; 20% female across the groups). Eight studies reported lower baseline symptom intensity (&lt; 60% on pain and disability scales), and there were insufficient data to categorize one study (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>All nine studies looked at MBR interventions with a physical component in combination with a psychological, social, and/or vocational component. Eight of the MBR interventions included an occupational component, which consisted of a worksite visit or a work rehabilitation plan or both, and two studies had a strong psychotherapy focus (<LINK REF="STD-Campello-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Campello 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiltenwolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schiltenwolf 2006</LINK>). Seven of the MBR interventions were integrated programs, meaning that there was communication between professionals from different disciplines. The interventions ranged in duration from two to 18 weeks, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>, which included only a 1.25 hour session aimed to increase body control and exercising, as well as a 75 minute work-site visit. None of the studies reported high-intensity interventions (&gt; 100 hours contact time delivered on a daily basis), three studies reported mid-intensity interventions (&gt; 30 and &lt; 100 hours contact time), and four studies reported low-intensity interventions (&lt; 30 hours contact time delivered on a non-daily basis).

In particular, these studies suffered from risk of bias in only two bias categories (performance bias and detection bias). Moreover, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>, these studies also included outcomes based on administrative data (e.g. return-to-work, sick leave data), thereby minimizing the impact of detection bias for these particular outcomes.

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2017-05-27 11:04:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the nature of the MBR intervention, none of the included studies achieved blinding of participants. Indeed, it would have been very difficult to keep participants blind to an intervention that they were actively participating in. However, blinding of personnel was achieved by <LINK REF="STD-Slater-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Slater 2009</LINK>. In this study assessors and therapists were not told about the alternative treatments and hypotheses, and treatments were conducted in separate areas to prevent cross-talk.</P>
<P>Measures of pain and disability rely on participant reports of their symptoms, which may be influenced by participants' knowledge of group assignment, as well as their expectations about the effectiveness of different interventions. In fact, in an MBR intervention, where there tends to be a great deal of face-to-face time between practitioners and participants, the experience of receiving the intervention may have an important impact on reported outcomes. However, six included studies measured more objective outcomes (e.g. sick leave data from health insurance companies). Thus, for these outcomes, detection bias was low.</P>
<P>Given the challenges of blinding in MBR trials, risk of performance bias and detection bias represented the main source of potential bias in this review. As a result of these study limitations, all of the evidence was downgraded by at least one point in the GRADE assessment (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK> section below).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-28 17:49:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included nine published RCTs, with data from close to 1000 participants. Overall, we found moderate to very low-quality evidence in favour of MBR compared to usual care for subacute LBP. In particular, compared to individuals receiving usual care, individuals receiving MBR showed less pain and back-specific disability, as well as increased likelihood of return-to-work and fewer sick leave days at 12-month follow-up. When comparing MBR to other treatments, we found low to very low-quality evidence that MBR was no better than other treatments (i.e. brief intervention with features from a light mobilization program and a graded activity program, functional restoration, brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise, and psychological counselling) for reducing pain and disability, and reducing time away from work.</P>
<P>Although more evidence is needed to increase our confidence in these results, the effect estimates for pain and disability were consistent across all follow-up points. For pain, they translated to about a 1-point difference on a 10-point scale, and for disability, they translated to around a 6.5- to 9-point difference on a 100-point scale. These effect sizes are at the low end of the range of estimates of clinical meaningfulness. Effects on work-related outcomes were somewhat larger; participants receiving MBR had more than three times the odds of return-to-work at one year compared to participants receiving usual care, and fewer sickness absence periods (approximately 215 to 254 hours) at follow-up.</P>
<P>Our findings suggest that MBR treatments are no better than other treatments for improving outcomes among people with subacute LBP. This was true across all primary outcomes, and at short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up points.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Findings for secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Studies in this review examined secondary outcomes, including symptoms of depression, pain catastrophising, fear-avoidance beliefs, general health, generic functional status and quality of life. However, we were unable to synthesize results across studies because of a lack of common outcomes across comparisons and follow-up periods. Results were generally inconsistent across studies - some showed improvements in the MBR group when compared to usual care or another treatment, while others showed no differences between the groups. The most consistent findings related to mental health outcomes at intermediate- and long-term follow-up. Namely, two studies showed benefits of MBR for reducing symptoms of depression and one showed benefits of MBR for improving mental health more generally. This points to the potential benefits of MBR for psychological well being among participants with subacute LBP and should be considered more fully in future research. However, it should be noted that we did not assess the quality of the evidence for these findings, and it is probably too early to use them as a basis for clinical decision-making.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-12 14:47:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides initial answers about the effectiveness of MBR for people with subacute LBP. However, the literature failed to cover all relevant types of participants, interventions, and outcomes. In particular, the evidence was based on a relatively homogenous group of participants. For example, all of the studies were conducted in North America and Europe, so it was unclear whether our findings generalized to people outside of these geographic areas. Moreover, all of the included studies were based on populations with relatively low baseline symptom intensity, thus we were unable to examine whether the treatment effect differed for people with high- versus low-intensity symptoms. However, we categorized symptom intensity based on the cut-off used by Kamper and colleagues in the Cochrane Review on MBR for chronic LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2014</LINK>) (greater than 60% of the maximum possible score on a pain and a disability measure), which may not be valid for people with subacute LBP.</P>
<P>We encountered the same issue when it came to classification of MBR interventions as high versus low-intensity. In particular, although we noted MBR interventions that ranged in intensity (e.g. 'mini' intervention plus worksite visit (&lt; three hours total)) in <LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK> versus 36-hour intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Campello-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Campello 2012</LINK>), none fell into the 'high-intensity' category based on our pre-established definition (i.e. &gt; 100 face-to-face hours delivered on a daily basis) (<LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2014</LINK>). Therefore, we were unable to examine whether intervention intensity influenced the treatment effect. Further consideration of the impact of intervention intensity on treatment outcome will be important for future updates, as it has implications for both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MBR interventions.</P>
<P>In regard to the outcomes reported, none of the studies in this review assessed adverse events, but given the nature of the intervention, the risk was considered low. Further, work outcomes and healthcare utilisation are key considerations for assessing the effects of MBR in this population, since they are primary determinants of the societal burden of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Maetzal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzal 2002</LINK>). Many of the included studies did not report these outcomes, and when reported they were measured in different ways. For example, in our analysis of work status at long-term follow up, we were able to statistically combine only three of the six studies that compared MBR to usual care.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-24 11:42:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings from this review provided mainly low to very low-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of MBR in this population. We mainly downgraded studies due to lack of blinding, which increased risk of performance bias, as well as risk of detection bias (i.e. biased self-reports of pain and disability due to knowledge of treatment group). However, effect sizes were similar for self-report outcomes (i.e. pain and disability) and behavioral outcomes (i.e. return-to-work and sickness absence), which are less susceptible to bias. This consistency across the different types of outcomes suggested that our findings may not be unduly influenced by bias associated with self-reported outcomes.</P>
<P>We also downgraded the evidence due to inconsistency. There was heterogeneity across participants and interventions, but we were unable to conduct subgroup analyses due to the limited number of studies identified. As a result, we lumped together some studies with a good deal of clinical heterogeneity. For example, we combined a low-intensity MBR intervention (i.e. 'mini' clinical intervention plus worksite visit (&lt; three hours total) (<LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>)) together with more intense interventions, but we were unable to explore the impact of this on our treatment estimates. Despite this, our results were quite consistent across outcomes for the MBR versus usual care comparison, which increases confidence in the treatment estimates.</P>
<P>In regard to the MBR versus 'other treatment' findings, clinical heterogeneity among the 'other treatments' may have contributed to the inconsistent effects across studies. For example, two studies compared MBR to a brief intervention, including a physical examination and advice to stay active (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>), one study compared MBR to a more extensive functional restoration program (<LINK REF="STD-Schiltenwolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schiltenwolf 2006</LINK>), and one study included a comparison that was mainly psychological in nature (<LINK REF="STD-Slater-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Slater 2009</LINK>). With only two studies included in each meta-analysis, it is likely that further research would change our estimates of effectiveness. Observed inconsistencies may be due to characteristics of the MBR intervention, characteristics of the comparison intervention, or a combination of the two.</P>
<P>We downgraded the evidence due to imprecision for both comparisons. We were dealing with small sample sizes, especially for the analyses looking at work-related outcomes. Therefore, the quality of the evidence and our confidence in the results will be much improved with the publication of large RCTs that consider common outcomes.</P>
<P>Finally, it should be noted that there is one completed study for which we were unable to find any published articles (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-12 14:45:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>First, it is challenging to operationalise the term 'multidisciplinary', and there is no universally accepted definition of MBR (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 2015</LINK>). Our definition is consistent with both the biopsychosocial model and previous Cochrane Reviews on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>). However, it is possible that selection of a different definition could result in inclusion of different studies and hence different effect estimates (see <LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2014</LINK> for a more detailed discussion).</P>
<P>Second, our definition of MBR was quite stringent, as we required involvement of healthcare professionals from at least two different clinical backgrounds. If future work shows that these types of MBR interventions are indeed effective for subacute LBP, a next step will be to examine whether similar effects are observed when less stringent definitions of MBR are applied.</P>
<P>Third, we have included in our meta-analyses all studies irrespective of their risk of bias. Including studies with high risk of bias may have affected the point estimates, particularly in cases indicating statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Finally, we made the decision a priori to omit non-published and non-peer-reviewed studies from the review, which may have contributed to publication bias given that publication status may be associated with positive study results. Unfortunately the influence of publication bias on our results was difficult to assess due to the limited number of studies contributing to each pooled estimate. However, we have one study awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Blanco" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Blanco</LINK>) with almost the same number of patients as our review (932) which is evidence of publication bias. Publication of this study could substantially change the conclusions of this review.<BR/>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-24 11:40:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results were fairly consistent with those of the Cochrane Review on MBR for chronic LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Kamper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamper 2014</LINK>). In particular, both reviews found evidence for the effectiveness of MBR when compared to usual care. However, whereas the current review did not find any evidence that MBR was more effective than other treatments for subacute LBP, Kamper and colleagues found that MBR was more effective than other physical interventions for chronic LBP. Although it was unclear why this was the case, it may be due to varying disease trajectories among people with subacute LBP - some will improve regardless of treatment, others will do well with simple monotherapies, and others will only improve with more tailored treatment approaches, such as MBR. In contrast, by the time people reach the chronic stage of LBP with its associated psychosocial stressors (e.g. increased time away from work, greater vulnerability to depression), we can expect a greater proportion of people to benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. If this is the case, it may be more effective to target subgroups of people with subacute LBP who are most likely to benefit from MBR.</P>
<P>We also compared our findings to a Cochrane Review on physical conditioning for workers with LBP (<LINK REF="REF-Schaafsma-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaafsma 2013</LINK>), which shared three included studies with our review (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Karjalainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karjalainen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Loisel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Loisel 1997</LINK>). Schaafsma and colleagues showed that physical conditioning reduced sickness absence duration compared to usual care among participants with subacute LBP, but only when the intervention took place in the workplace or it included a workplace visit. This finding is consistent with our results, which also suggested that a physical intervention may be effective when combined with a psychological or workplace intervention or both.</P>
<P>An important next step will be to disentangle the impact of the physical, psychological and workplace components and to identify underlying mechanisms. To this end, it would be informative to compare our results with those of other reviews examining monotherapies for subacute LBP, especially those relating to MBR, such as back schools, graded behavioral activity, workplace interventions, and psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy. However, we were unable to find up-to-date reviews that examined these interventions among participants with subacute LBP.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-27 11:05:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On average, people with subacute LBP that receive MBR will do better than if they receive usual care, but it is not clear whether they do better than people who receive some other type of treatment. However, the available research provides mainly low to very low-quality evidence, thus additional high-quality trials are needed before we can make definitive recommendations for clinical practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-27 11:05:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for additional large, high-quality RCTs, which would assess the effectiveness of comprehensive MBR programs for people with subacute LBP, as well as the effectiveness of the specific components involved in rehabilitation. Moreover, given that these programs are so costly, we recommend that future RCTs include economic analyses to fully examine the costs and benefits of MBR for this population.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-06-11 09:22:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the previous version of the review, we updated the methods in accordance with the <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2015</LINK> method guidelines. </P>
<P>We only included studies when the full report was peer-reviewed. We also worked with translators to review all non-English studies against the inclusion criteria. In the previous version of the review, we included studies where the patients had experienced low back pain for more than four weeks but less than three months. In this update, we included patients with pain for more than six weeks but less than 12 weeks. We clarified that we included participants with or without radiating pain and excluded patients during or immediately following pregnancy.</P>
<P>For the intervention, we clarified that the MBR program must involve healthcare professionals from at least two different clinical backgrounds, which led to the exclusion of a previously included study, and defined the physical, psychological, and social/occupational components. We also outlined the comparisons to be included in the review. We did not include satisfaction with treatment as an outcome in this version of the review. Instead we looked at psychological and cognitive function (depression, anxiety, fear avoidance and coping satisfaction). </P>

<U>Brief clinical intervention</U>: A standard clinical LBP examination was carried out by the physician, relevant imaging and examinations were ordered, and treatment options were discussed. Information was given in a reassuring way and medical pain management was adjusted. The participants were advised to resume work when possible. The physiotherapy examination included a standardized, mechanical evaluation, and advice on exercise was chosen accordingly. General advice was given to increase physical activity and exercise. For all participants, a follow-up visit at the physiotherapist was scheduled 2 weeks later, and a follow-up visit at the physician was arranged for participants needing answers in relation to test results.<BR/>
<U>Multidisciplinary intervention</U>: In addition to the brief clinical intervention described above, participants allocated to the multidisciplinary intervention group were scheduled for an interview with a case manager within two to three workdays. This interview was standardised and included questions of work history, private life, and questions on how pain and disability were perceived. It normally lasted for 1 to 2 hours. The participant was seen one or more times by the case manager depending on need and progress. The case manager and the participant together made a tailored rehabilitation plan aiming at full or partial RTW. Each case was discussed several times by the entire multidisciplinary team including the rehabilitation physician, a specialist in clinical social medicine, a physiotherapist, a social worker, and an occupational therapist.</P>

<P>A total of 164 participants with subacute low back pain were randomised to a mini-intervention group (A), a worksite visit group (B), or a usual care group (C). Groups A (n = 56) and B (n = 51) underwent one assessment by a physician plus a physiotherapist. Group B received a worksite visit in addition. Group C served as a control group (n = 57) and was treated in municipal primary health care. All participants received a leaflet on back pain.</P>

<P>n = 51, mean age = 44 (25 to 60), 57% female.</P>
<P>Intervention by the physicians and the physiotherapist was identical to that in the mini-intervention group and performed without knowledge of final group assignment. The physiotherapist visited the participant's work site, along with the participant's work supervisor and company nurse, and physician. The aim of the visit, which lasted for approximately 75 minutes, was to ensure that the participant had adapted to the information and practical instructions of appropriate ways of using the back at work, to involve the supervisor and company health care professionals, and to encourage their cooperation.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 1 </B>= <B>Mini intervention alone </B>
</P>
<P>n = 56, mean age = 44 (25 to 60), 59% female.</P>
<P>A physician specializing in physiatry first interviewed and examined the participants in the mini-intervention group and encouraged them to ask anything unclear about their back pain. Working conditions were discussed and the results of the clinical examination explained to the participant and the radiograph findings and causes of pain clarified, as far as possible. The main aim of these consultations was to reduce the participants' concerns about their back pain by providing accurate information and to encourage physical activity. The physiotherapist instructed the participant no more than five exercises for improving the function of deep abdominal muscles and establishing symmetric use of the back. Other daily exercises were planned that were feasible enough for the participant to commit to and execute them. The aim of this approximately 1.5-hour session was to increase body control and exercising in everyday life.</P>
<P>*The duration of the mini intervention was 1.25 to 1.5 hours and the worksite visit was approximately 75 minutes = low intensity.</P>

<P>Participants in the usual care group were not examined at FIOH but did receive a leaflet on back pain (as did all other study participants). They were treated by their GPs in primary health care in the usual manner, including specialist consultations and physiotherapy, when necessary. They were not restricted from seeking specialist treatment privately, i.e. at their own expense if they so wished.</P>

<P>Participants agreeing to participate were asked to complete baseline questionnaires at FIOH. The research nurse then randomised each participant into one of the three study groups; to ensure even distribution of participants regarding gender and age &gt; 45 and &lt; 45 years, four piles of sealed envelopes were used, and in each, the randomizations was done in blocks of 15. A biostatistician had prepared the order from a random number table. A secretary unconnected with the participants had numbered the envelopes sequentially to prevent their rearrangement. The research nurse and researchers were not aware of the block size and therefore could not predict the group assignments.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Given the exploratory purpose and small scale of this study, both a modified intent-to-treat analysis, assessing between-group differences in proportion recovered among all enrolled participants who completed the 6-month follow-up assessment (n = 65), and a completer (n = 50) analysis were planned a priori. We did not include the 2 participants (1 in each group) who completed 4 treatment sessions but not the 6-month follow-up in these analyses because we did not have any good data from which to estimate their 6-month recovery status. If we were to carry forward their baseline values, they would both of necessity be classified as having chronic pain based on the inclusion criteria; however, we rejected this approach, given that they chose to receive a full dose of either behavioral or attention control treatment. Noninclusion of these individuals should not have systematically biased the results in favour of one or the other condition, but could have slightly increased proportional estimates of recovery in both groups. Supplemental analyses were also conducted on participants who attended all 4 sessions and the 6-month follow-up (n = 50) and the maximum dose sample who attended all 4 sessions and 2 boosters (n = 32).<BR/>

For example, physiotherapy treatment is usually administered for several sessions; therefore, it<BR/>is necessary to assess how many sessions each patient attended. For single-session interventions (e.g.,<BR/>surgery), this item is irrelevant.</P>

The conflict of interest (COI) statement should explicitly state that the researchers<BR/>have had full possession of the trial process from planning to reporting without funders with potential COI<BR/>having any possibility to interfere in the process. If, for example, the statistical analyses have been done by a<BR/>funder with a potential COI, usually ''unsure'' is scored.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-27 19:02:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence will be categorized as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>High (&#8857;&#8857;&#8857;&#8857;): further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate (&#8857;&#8857;&#8857;&#9675;): further research is likely to have an important impact in the confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Low (&#8857;&#8857;&#9675;&#9675;): further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Very Low (&#8857;&#9675;&#9675;&#9675;): any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We graded the evidence in the following manner:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Study design</HEADING>
<P>For evidence from RCTs and quasi-RCTs, we started with a rating of `high`and downgraded based on factors 2 - 6 described below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Risk of Bias (RoB)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed RoB for included studies using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back and Neck (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2015</LINK>), as outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> These criteria fall into five bias categories:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, group similarities at baseline);</LI>
<LI>Performance (blinding of participants, blinding of healthcare providers, cointerventions, and compliance with intervention);</LI>
<LI>Attrition (dropouts and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis);</LI>
<LI>Measurement (blinding of the outcome assessors and timing of outcome assessment);</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias (selective reporting).</LI>
</OL>
<P>To incorporate RoB into the GRADE assessment, we rated the overall extent of RoB within each bias category (e.g. performance bias) as 'bias' or 'no bias':</P>
<UL>
<LI>We did not downgrade evidence from studies judged 'no bias' for four or five categories.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We downgraded evidence (-1 point) when three or fewer categories for each study were judged to have bias or unclear bias.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We downgraded by -2 points when four or more categories for each study were judged to have bias or unclear bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Inconsistency</HEADING>
<P>Inconsistency refers to unexplained heterogeneity of results. Widely differing estimates of the treatment effect (such as, heterogeneity or variability in results) across trials suggest true differences in the underlying treatment effect.</P>
<P>Inconsistency may arise from differences among populations (e.g. multidisciplinary interventions may have larger relative effects in sicker populations), interventions (e.g. larger effects with more intense interventions), or outcomes (for example, diminishing treatment effect with time).</P>
<P>This item does not apply when there is only one trial. We downgraded the quality of evidence by one point when the heterogeneity or variability in results was large, as indicated by an I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Indirectness</HEADING>
<P>We assessed whether the question being addressed in this systematic review was different from the available evidence regarding the population, intervention, comparison, or outcome. We downgraded the quality of evidence by one point when there was indirectness in only one area; and by two points when there was indirectness in two or more areas.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Imprecision</HEADING>
<P>Results are imprecise when trials include relatively few participants and few events and thus have wide CIs around the estimate of the effect.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we considered imprecision for either of the following two reasons:</P>
<P>(1) There was only one trial. When there was more than one trial, the total number of events was &lt; 300 (a threshold rule-of-thumb value) (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>(2) 95% CI around the pooled or best estimate of effect included both (1) no effect and (2) appreciable benefit or appreciable harm. The threshold for 'appreciable benefit' or 'appreciable harm' is a relative risk reduction (RRR) or relative risk increase (RRI) &gt; 25%. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one point when there was imprecision due to (1) or (2); or by two levels when there was imprecision due to (1) and (2).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we considered imprecision for either of the following two reasons:</P>
<P>(1) There was only one trial. When there was more than one trial, the total population size was &lt; 400 (a threshold rule-of-thumb value; using the usual &#945; and &#946;, and an effect size of 0.2 SD, representing a small effect).</P>
<P>(2) 95% CI included no effect and the upper or lower CI crosses an effect size (standardized mean difference) of 0.5 in either direction. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one point when there was imprecision due to (1) or (2); or by two points when there was imprecision due to (1) and (2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias is a systematic underestimate or an overestimate of the underlying beneficial or harmful effect due to the selective publication of trials. We planned to create funnel plots for comparisons with at least 10 included studies and to downgrade the quality of the evidence by one point when the funnel plot suggested publication bias. However, we did not identify enough studies to conduct this analysis.</P>
