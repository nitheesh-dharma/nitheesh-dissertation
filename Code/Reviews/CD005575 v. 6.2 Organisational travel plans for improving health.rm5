<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-15 02:49:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Travel plans aim to reduce car use and promote more active and sustainable travel such as walking and cycling. This review focuses on travel plans for organisations, such as workplaces or schools. The main reasons for using travel plans are to reduce congestion and to be environmentally friendly, but travel plans are also commonly claimed to improve health. We included 17 studies in this review. One study found that promoting walking in a workplace improved some aspects of health, including mental health, but no other studies directly measured health effects. All 17 studies looked at changes in travel. Although some found that travel plans increased walking, others did not. Overall, there is not enough evidence to know whether travel plans are effective at changing the way people travel, or whether they improve health. Currently, organisational travel plans should be put in place as part of well-designed research studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-17 01:05:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dependence on car use has a number of broad health implications, including contributing to physical inactivity, road traffic injury, air pollution and social severance, as well as entrenching lifestyles that require environmentally unsustainable energy use. Travel plans are interventions that aim to reduce single-occupant car use and increase the use of alternatives such as walking, cycling and public transport, with a variety of behavioural and structural components. This review focuses on organisational travel plans for schools, tertiary institutes and workplaces. These plans are closely aligned in their aims and intervention design, having emerged from a shared theoretical base.</P>

<P>Seventeen studies were included. Ten were conducted in a school setting, two in universities, and five in workplaces. One study directly measured health outcomes, and all included studies measured travel outcomes. Two cluster randomised controlled trials in the school setting showed either no change in travel mode or mixed results. A randomised controlled trial in the workplace setting, conducted in a pre-selected group who were already contemplating or preparing for active travel, found improved health-related quality of life on some sub scales, and increased walking. Two controlled before-after studies found that school travel interventions increased walking. Other studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. No included studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries, and no studies measured the social distribution of effects or adverse effects, such as injury.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether organisational travel plans are effective for improving health or changing travel mode. Organisational travel plans should be considered as complex health promotion interventions, with considerable potential to influence community health outcomes depending on the environmental context in which they are introduced.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-16 11:33:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-02 01:17:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pattern of urban development over the past century has created a physical and social environment where dependence on car use has become the norm for accessing essential goods and services, as well as recreational opportunities. This condition has a number of broad health implications, including contributing to sedentary lifestyles, road traffic injury, air pollution and social severance, as well as entrenching lifestyles that require environmentally unsustainable energy use. The significant contribution of car-dependent transport systems to climate change (<LINK REF="REF-IPCC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPCC 2007</LINK>) is one manifestation of the public health implications of this unsustainable energy use. In addition, it is likely that the health effects of our current transport choices are inequitably distributed across socioeconomic strata, and by ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Frank-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-02-16 11:33:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The term 'travel plan' refers to behaviour change programmes that aim to reduce single-occupant car use, and increase the use of alternatives such as walking, cycling and public transport, through a variety of behavioural and structural interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 2004</LINK>). Their implementation is most often encouraged by local and regional government to reduce traffic congestion. Although travel plans are not health interventions, they could potentially have health impacts in a number of different areas. For example, travel plans might increase physical activity, and physical activity is associated with a wide range of health benefits (<LINK REF="REF-US-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">US DoH 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Travel plans aim to reduce car traffic. Reductions in car traffic would lead to a decline in air and noise pollution, which are associated with morbidity and mortality. Traffic may also have effects on mental health, social networks and child development (<LINK REF="REF-Dora-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dora 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There may also be health risks associated with travel plans, depending on their implementation. A potential adverse effect of organisational travel plans that is of particular concern is the possibility of increasing road traffic injury to cyclists and pedestrians (due to increased exposure). There is also controversy about the differential exposure to air pollution for car occupants and pedestrians or cyclists, with some studies finding lower exposure to pedestrians and cyclists (for example <LINK REF="REF-Van-Wijnen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Wijnen 1995</LINK>) and other evidence suggesting that greater exposure to harmful pollutants occurs to pedestrians and cyclists (for example the Leicester case study in <LINK REF="REF-WHO-HEARTS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO HEARTS 2006</LINK>). The impact on people with disabilities is also unclear. Travel plans and related interventions could potentially increase health inequalities, particularly if the success of their implementation depends on the ethnicity and socioeconomic status of the participating population (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of assault or abduction during travel is also an important influence on parents' decisions about travel to school (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>). While the actual risk of such events may be low, the high perceived risk is a barrier to active transport for some. This may be addressed for children through adult-supervised walking such as in the example of walking school buses (groups of children walking to school chaperoned by a number of volunteer parents).</P>
<P>Travel plans can only exert their health effects (and contribute to their congestion and environmental aims) if they are successful in changing travel behaviour. The health effects of travel plans are often viewed by design as "co-benefits" rather than primary goals. It is important that the health impacts are well understood so that health benefits can be maximised, and health risks mitigated.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-02-03 20:46:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Travel plans exert their health effects by changing transport behaviour. Several types of travel plan have been described, including school, business and community travel plans (<LINK REF="REF-EECA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EECA 2005</LINK>). This review will focus on school and business travel plans, as 'organisational' travel plans. These two types of plan have particular similarities: as both schools and businesses are organisations, the unit under study is similar. Travel occurs at similar times for both of these travel plan types; both types of plan focus on active transport (rather than leisure-time physical activity); and schools could be considered the equivalent of 'workplaces' for children. They differ in that school children are less likely to be making their own choices about mode of travel.</P>
<P>Organisational travel plans comprise multiple components, the mix of which depends on the organisation in which they are implemented. Common components include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>organisational policies facilitating active transport (e.g. provision of cycle racks, lockers and showers) or restricting car transport (e.g. parking restrictions);</LI>
<LI>provision or co-ordination of more active and sustainable transport options (e.g. walking bus or motorised school bus provision, public transport subsidies, carpooling co-ordination);</LI>
<LI>engineering measures (e.g. pedestrian crossings, cycle ways, footpath improvements);</LI>
<LI>promotional measures for alternative transport (e.g. 'walk to school' days, promotion of alternatives to car use);</LI>
<LI>education measures (e.g. pedestrian safety or cycle training, education about benefits of active transport);</LI>
<LI>enforcement measures (e.g. speed restrictions);</LI>
<LI>travel demand reduction or spreading measures (e.g. telecommuting, flexible start/finish hours - primarily for workplace travel plans);</LI>
<LI>other specific measures devised by the organisation in question.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In summary, organisational travel plans are complex interventions that aim to change how people travel, using a mix of different strategies, depending on the organisation in question. By changing how people travel, the plans may indirectly affect health. Health effects may occur because travel by different modes involves different risks and benefits, such as different levels of physical activity and injury risk.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:03:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>If travel plans can be shown to have health benefits, they might in future be implemented as health promotion programmes. However, at present it is not clear whether travel plans affect health at all and, if so, whether they have a positive or negative effect. Despite this, community resources are starting to be allocated to develop and implement various plans, with benefits to health beginning to be seen as part of their rationale.</P>
<P>A systematic review is therefore required to assess the current evidence about the health effects of travel plans. The authors of this review are unaware of any pre-existing review of travel plans and health. Related reviews have, however, been conducted, including a systematic review of broader interventions to promote walking and cycling (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie 2004</LINK>). This review included some travel plans, but did not focus on travel plans as an intervention. Other related reviews have covered environmental and policy interventions to promote physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Sallis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sallis 1998</LINK>) and transport interventions for the improvement of population health (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2003</LINK>). There have also been reviews of physical activity interventions in schools (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 1998</LINK>) and workplaces (<LINK REF="REF-Dishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dishman 1998</LINK>), and a general review of physical activity interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2002</LINK>), but these have focused on non-travel-related physical activity. A systematic review of traffic calming (<LINK REF="REF-Bunn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunn 2005</LINK>) included interventions to improve road safety rather than travel behaviour change interventions. This review aims specifically to assess the effects of organisational travel plans on health.</P>

<P>These interventions are conducted in organisations. Participants are therefore working age adults, tertiary students or schoolchildren. However, health effects may occur in people not participating in the intervention. For instance, an organisational travel plan may decrease traffic volumes in the local area. This could reduce respiratory disease due to air pollution, or reduce road traffic injuries. These effects would not be limited to participants in the intervention, and would occur across the local geographical area. Organisational travel plans may also have effects on the families of intervention participants (for instance, changing the transport choices of school children may also change the behaviour of their parents or siblings).</P>
<P>Accordingly, a study that aims to assess the health effects of organisational travel plans may define its participant population as being different from the population undertaking the intervention. Instead, the population in which outcomes are measured could potentially be defined as the entire local community.</P>

<P>Organisational travel plans.</P>
<P>To be included, interventions must have been conducted in an organisational setting. This includes schools and workplaces, but not households or communities.</P>
<P>To be included, the intervention being studied must have been a travel behaviour change programme (<LINK REF="REF-Maunsell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maunsell 2004</LINK>). The programme must have aimed to change travel behaviour from relatively inactive transport to more active transport (e.g. from car use to walking or public transport use), or to change travel behaviour in a way that aims to reduce car use (e.g. carpooling). Thus, an intervention that aimed to increase walking for transport would be included, but walking itself as an intervention would not be included, since walking does not constitute a travel behaviour change programme.</P>
<P>Stand-alone interventions that primarily aimed to improve road safety (such as traffic calming) were not considered to constitute travel behaviour change programmes. However, a travel behaviour change programme that included a traffic calming component would be eligible if conducted in an organisational setting.</P>

<P>Physical activity was a secondary outcome, since there is a large body of evidence linking physical activity levels to health outcomes.</P>
<P>Changes in travel mode (such as changes in the relative proportions of those travelling by car and those travelling by walking) was also a secondary outcome. There is a growing body of research linking travel mode to health outcomes, and relevant studies were likely to have measured travel mode shift as an outcome without directly measuring health outcomes. Health outcomes resulting from significant travel mode change could potentially be modelled from existing evidence.</P>
<P>We also considered the distribution of any relevant health effects, so that if organisational travel plans were shown to have effects on health inequalities, this was considered a relevant outcome.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:03:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>For all randomised studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria, we assessed the study quality on the basis of allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and loss to follow-up.</P>
<P>There are fewer standardised approaches to quality assessment for controlled before-after studies compared with randomised controlled trials. The exact criteria for appraising controlled before-after studies was defined on the basis of the identified studies. However, in our protocol we planned to use an approach used in a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bunn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunn 2005</LINK>) as a starting point, where the authors evaluated:<BR/>1. the length of data collection before and after the intervention;<BR/>2. how the intervention and control areas were matched;<BR/>3. the proximity of the control area to the intervention area.</P>
<P>On reviewing the identified studies, it became clear that of these three criteria, the first was not well-suited to assessing organisational travel plans. The length of data collection before and after the traffic calming intervention was important in <LINK REF="REF-Bunn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunn 2005</LINK> because they were counting relatively infrequent stochastic injury events, whereas studies included in our review were typically measuring changes in travel behaviour, a continuous outcome. The second and third criteria were combined into an criterion of 'Adequate matching of intervention/control areas?', which included matching by geographical location, baseline travel mode and relevant demographic characteristics.</P>
<P>Two authors independently appraised study quality. Where there was a discrepancy between authors in the appraised study quality, we resolved differences by discussion. If the two authors were unable to agree, a third author would arbitrate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants were school children, university students or employees in workplaces, depending on the setting. Where reported, participants included both genders.</P>
<P>The participating schools in <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK> were socioeconomically disadvantaged, with a high proportion of African American and Latino children. However, the distribution of outcomes between socioeconomic or ethnic groups was not reported.</P>
<P>No studies evaluated intervention effects on the wider community (for example, community road traffic injury rates).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>While all studies included interventions that aimed to change travel behaviour, not all were labelled 'travel plans'. Travel plan interventions were heterogeneous in their components, duration and intensity, reflecting the natural variability of such context-dependent interventions.</P>
<P>Ten studies were conducted in the school setting. These interventions included multiple components targeting the school, individual schoolchildren and in some cases other bodies such as local councils. Intervention components varied across studies, but included the time of a travel coordinator; activities through local councils to improve the safety of the neighbourhood; provision of safety and promotional information to encourage car-alternative modes of transport to school; within classroom educational modules; and the organisation of walking school buses (groups of children walking to school chaperoned by a number of volunteer parents). Some interventions were much more intensive than others, with substantial variation in the number of activities included in the intervention, the number of different groups targeted by the intervention (e.g. school, schoolchildren, councils) and the duration of the intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>, a school travel co-ordinator was provided, whose role was to undertake a range of actions designed to promote walking to school; in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>, the main focus was co-ordinating a walking school bus. In both cases, the intervention duration was a year, but the intensity of input from the travel co-ordinator varied (10-15 hours/week in <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>; 16 hours per year in <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK>, the 19 month intervention also included a wide range of actions to promote walking to school, but was led by a project advisory group rather than a co-ordinator role, and the amount of input per week was unclear. The Department for Transport Studies (<LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Bracknell-Forest" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Bracknell Forest</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Lancashire" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Lancashire</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Redcar-Cleveland" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Redcar Cleveland</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Telford-Wrekin" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Telford Wrekin</LINK>) were likely to have similar activities, as described in a DfT Best Practice Guide for these interventions, however these were not described for each study. In <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2007</LINK> the intervention focused on classroom education and resources for children on active travel over a 10 week duration, while the two TAPESTRY studies (<LINK REF="STD-TAPESTRY-Dublin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">TAPESTRY Dublin 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TAPESTRY-Herts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">TAPESTRY Herts 2003</LINK>) included similar intervention components but only for a single week.</P>
<P>Four of the five workplace studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-2004-Addenbrooke" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 2004 Addenbrooke</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-2004-Car-Park" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 2004 Car Park</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-2004-New-Recruit" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 2004 New Recruit</LINK>) included the provision of advice and materials promoting active and sustainable travel (e.g. walking, cycling or public transport) to individual participants, without any intervention at the organisational level. In the fifth (<LINK REF="STD-Atherton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Atherton 1982</LINK>), the intervention was the adoption of a compressed work week, with participants working normal weekly hours over fewer days (either four-day weeks or nine-day fortnights).</P>
<P>The two studies based in tertiary education institutions used methods that differed significantly from the other studies. <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 2005</LINK> evaluated a group-based travel behaviour change programme in which group co-ordinators were also seen as intervention participants (and changes in their travel behaviour were thus measured), and <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 1982</LINK> evaluated the use of a promotion and education intervention to encourage car-pooling.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>) measured health outcomes, which were the primary outcomes that our review considered. The health outcome measured in this study was health-related quality of life, as measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>All 17 studies measured changes in travel behaviour. No other relevant outcomes were measured by the included studies.</P>
<P>Travel behaviour change was measured in diverse ways by different studies. Most commonly, studies measured the proportions of participants using each different travel mode (e.g. car, walking, cycling, bus). Some studies grouped modes, e.g. into an 'other' category, or into 'eco friendly' travel modes (defined in <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 2005</LINK> as walking, bus or train use, though cycling could also be considered 'eco friendly'). The measurement of travel mode use was complicated by participants using multiple travel modes, for instance <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK> used categories such as 'walk all the way some days'. Other travel measures used included distance travelled by different modes and time spent using each mode, both of which require more information to calculate compared with the simple proportion of participants using each travel mode.</P>
<P>The different measures of travel mode used meant we were unable to directly compare results across all studies.</P>
<P>No studies presented data on the distribution of effects by ethnicity or socio-economic status. <LINK REF="STD-Atherton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Atherton 1982</LINK> reported that travel mode shift was similar among intervention group participants who 'represented a broad range of socioeconomic characteristics', but did not present any data to support this statement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other study characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Of the 17 included studies, nine were identified by Internet searches (<LINK REF="STD-TAPESTRY-Herts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">TAPESTRY Herts 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TAPESTRY-Dublin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">TAPESTRY Dublin 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-2004-Addenbrooke" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 2004 Addenbrooke</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-2004-Car-Park" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 2004 Car Park</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-2004-New-Recruit" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 2004 New Recruit</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Redcar-Cleveland" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Redcar Cleveland</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Bracknell-Forest" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Bracknell Forest</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Lancashire" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Lancashire</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Telford-Wrekin" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Telford Wrekin</LINK>). The remaining eight studies were identified by searches of electronic databases. While this suggests that Internet searches were an important method of identifying studies, studies identified by this method were all judged to be at high risk of bias (see 'Risk of bias in included studies' section).</P>

<P>We assessed risk of bias according to the following criteria: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting, matching of intervention and control groups and other bias. The criteria of sequence generation and allocation concealment were only able to be satisfied by studies using randomised designs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> show the review authors' opinion on the risk of bias for each included study. Generally, more green (+ sign) results indicate lower risk of bias, and more red (- sign) results indicate a higher risk of bias. Yellow (? sign) results indicate that there was not sufficient information to properly assess risk of bias for that attribute; such results are not necessarily preferable to red (- sign) results, since they may indicate poor reporting of attributes that are relevant to the risk of bias.</P>
<P>Overall risk of bias was judged to be high for most included studies. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>) were judged to have a low risk of bias on at least three of our criteria. A further two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McKee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>) were judged to have a low risk of bias on two of our criteria, and the remaining studies were judged to have a low risk of bias on one criterion or no criteria.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005</LINK> studies, the authors reported needing to 'carry out extensive data cleaning' and being 'constrained by the quality of the data available'.

<P>In both <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK>, interventions were able to influence a range of factors at the level of schools, individuals and other community agencies. The intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK> appeared to be more intensive, though it was difficult to be certain of this from the intervention description. It is possible that the lack of intervention effect, particularly in <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>, was at least partly due to the low intensity of the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>, a randomised controlled trial in the workplace setting, found that the intervention led to significantly greater increases in walking in both those who already walked to work at baseline, and those who did not walk to work at baseline. The intervention differed from <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>, being an interactive information pack and safety accessories. However, participants were a pre-selected group who were already contemplating or preparing to actively commute.</P>
<P>Among the remaining studies, two were judged to be at less risk of bias than others. <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2007</LINK>, a controlled before-after study, found that active travel curriculum materials for teachers and classes, plus a child and family information pack, led to a significantly larger increase in mean distance walked to school in the intervention group (602 m) compared with the control group (47 m). There was also a significant decrease in mean distance travelled by car in the intervention group, which was not seen in the control group. However, average distance between home and school differed substantially for the intervention and control groups, which may have influenced the results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>, a controlled before-after study, measured the effects of a walking school bus co-ordinator on habitual travel to school (that is, travel to school on days when the walking school bus was not operating) and found that the proportion of children walking to school increased significantly in intervention schools (from 20% to 25%), but decreased significantly in control schools (from 15% to 7%). However, participant responses at baseline and follow-up were not matched and it was possible that incomplete outcome data could have led to bias in the results, either towards or away from the null.</P>
<P>The remaining 12 studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. Of these, seven found a significant effect on travel mode in the direction of reduced car use. Four found no significant effects, and one showed mixed results.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:14:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Two cluster randomised controlled trials of school travel plans demonstrated mixed effects on travel mode (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK> involved a relatively low-intensity intervention, and found no intervention effect, though confidence intervals were wide. <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK> appeared to involve a higher intensity intervention, but found an intervention effect only for parent-reported outcomes for the trip from home to school, and not for student-reported outcomes or for the trip from school to home. <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK> thus provided only weak support for an intervention effect, despite using a higher intensity intervention.</P>
<P>One randomised controlled trial in a workplace setting (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>), involving an information pack and safety accessories for staff already contemplating or preparing for walking to work, found increased walking and improved health as measured by SF-36. It is therefore unknown whether such organisational travel plans would have effects in individuals who were not already in a primed state in terms of behaviour change.</P>
<P>Two controlled before-after studies found that school travel interventions increased walking (<LINK REF="STD-McKee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining studies identified by this review were judged to be at high risk of bias.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-01-10 21:56:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified few robust studies of organisational travel plans. There is currently no evidence for an effect of organisational travel plans on any of the expected health outcomes, except in workers already preparing for or contemplating active travel (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>). There is very limited evidence that organisational travel plans influence travel mode, and much of this limited evidence applies to the school setting.</P>
<P>While all studies we identified were travel behaviour change programmes, only seven (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Bracknell-Forest" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Bracknell Forest</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Lancashire" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Lancashire</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Redcar-Cleveland" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Redcar Cleveland</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DfT-2005-Telford-Wrekin" TYPE="STUDY">DfT 2005 Telford Wrekin</LINK>) included the multi-component sustained interventions at both organisational and individual levels that are generally referred to as school or workplace 'travel plans'. None of these were conducted in the workplace setting. Other studies were of relatively specific interventions such as information packs for participants and/or educational resources, either of which may be one component within an organisational travel plan. The findings of these studies of more specific interventions are less applicable to organisational travel plans in general.</P>
<P>One study directly assessed health outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>), and was conducted in a pre-selected group who were already contemplating or preparing for active travel. The results of this study therefore have limited applicability to organisational travel plans in general.</P>
<P>We identified no studies that assessed whether intervention effects are maintained over longer periods (e.g. years).</P>
<P>No studies were identified in low- or middle-income country settings. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mendoza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza 2009</LINK>) was undertaken in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area of a high income country. However, no studies presented data on the social distribution of effects, e.g. whether the effects of these interventions differed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-10-06 03:34:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of organisational travel plans is low to moderate, with most studies having multiple design limitations.</P>
<P>We identified two cluster randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 2008</LINK>) and one well-designed randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>) that were at lower risk of bias than other studies.</P>
<P>However, of these three studies, one was conducted in a pre-selected group who were more likely to change their travel behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Mutrie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mutrie 2002</LINK>), and the magnitude of effect is thus of limited applicability to other travel behaviour change interventions.</P>
<P>More robustly designed studies would enable clearer conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of organisational travel plans for improving health.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:15:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We carried out a systematic and sensitive search of electronic databases, complemented by review of a large number of web sites and several other sources of grey literature. However, organisational travel plans are poorly indexed in biomedical databases, and it appears likely that many evaluations of these interventions are not published in a form that is indexed by electronic databases. Despite our additional Internet searches, we may not have identified all relevant studies. Accordingly, we encourage authors of any potentially eligible studies not identified by this review to contact us.</P>
<P>Eleven of the seventeen studies that we identified for inclusion in this review were carried out in the United Kingdom. It is possible that travel plans may be more popular in the United Kingdom, or that greater efforts may have been made to evaluate travel plans in the United Kingdom than other countries. While we do not believe it is likely that our search of electronic databases was biased, there was more potential for bias in the list of websites we searched, which we adapted from a previous systematic review from the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was notable that all studies identified from Internet searches alone were judged to be at high risk of bias, suggesting that our searches of electronic databases may have identified the most robust studies. Nevertheless, publication bias in this review remains a possibility.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Cairns--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 2004</LINK> suggested that school travel plans were likely to lead to car use reductions in the order of 8-15%, based on a narrative review of the literature that included uncontrolled evaluations. <LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie 2007</LINK>, a systematic review, suggested that the evidence that interventions at an institutional level can promote walking was not convincing. <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2003</LINK>, reviewing findings from systematic reviews, found no evidence to suggest that any intervention is effective at achieving travel mode shift. Our findings are consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie 2007</LINK>. While an 8-15% decrease in car use from school travel plans can not be excluded at present, we consider that more robust studies are needed to establish whether or not these interventions lead to decreased car use, other travel mode changes or health effects.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-15 02:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-02-15 02:51:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Significant emphasis is currently placed on organisational travel plans for changing the dominant mode of travel to work, school and tertiary education, with a number of environmental, social and physical health aims. Despite their considerable potential for influencing health through changing travel behaviour, evidence that organisational travel plans are effective is very limited. There is currently no evidence, outside pre-selected highly motivated subgroups, that organisational travel plans have any effect on any health outcomes or risk factors that might be expected, such as injury, obesity, physical activity, air quality or social outcomes. Organisational travel plans are implemented in widely varying environmental contexts, which may impact significantly on their effectiveness. For instance, the safety of walking and cycling environments, and the accessibility of public transport are likely to be influential.</P>
<P>In practice, organisational travel plans should be considered complex health promotion interventions. Given lack of evidence for their effectiveness, the implementation of organisational travel plans should currently be in the context of robustly-designed research studies, such as well-designed cluster randomised trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-03 20:46:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More robust studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of organisational travel plans for changing travel mode or improving health. In particular, designs that minimise selection bias through randomisation, and that include follow up of individual participants, are needed. More consistent follow up of adequate duration both before and after the intervention would allow secular time trends to be identified and separated from the effect of the intervention itself. In addition, having a longer duration of follow up, with a number of time points for measuring outcomes, would increase our understanding of whether the effects of the intervention are sustained over time, or whether they are cumulative, with increasing effect over time (plausible with an ongoing social intervention such as this).</P>
<P>Cluster randomised controlled trials appear to be a good study design for evaluating these interventions, and should be well designed to minimise the risk of bias. If a controlled before-after study design is used in future studies, efforts will be needed to ensure intervention and control groups are well matched on baseline characteristics, and to ensure that the risk of bias from incomplete outcome data is minimised.</P>
<P>There is a particular lack of studies in the workplace setting, although additional studies in the school setting are also needed.</P>
<P>Studies included in this review used a range of different methods for measuring travel outcomes. Consistent and robust methods for measuring travel outcomes are needed in future studies. The direct measurement of physical activity, rather than just travel mode, where feasible, would enable more accurate assessment of the health effects of these interventions.</P>
<P>Since increased injury risk is a potential adverse effect from these interventions, it would be useful for future studies to measure injury outcomes. While travel mode shift from car use to walking is likely to increase physical activity and reduce air pollution, whether it will increase or reduce injuries is unclear. Injury outcomes will need to be measured directly, which may require different study designs, including mapping over large areas.</P>
<P>Future studies should include evaluation of the social distribution of effects, e.g. whether the effects of these interventions differ by ethnicity or socioeconomic status, to determine whether different strategies are needed for different population groups. This may include the tailoring of interventions for currently disadvantaged population groups, whose needs may differ in important ways from more privileged social groups (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>). Additional qualitative research in disadvantaged settings may be needed to inform such tailoring of interventions.</P>
