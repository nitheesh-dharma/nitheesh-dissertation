<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), when given with antibiotics, does not appear to reduce mortality in adults with pneumonia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Pneumonia, or infection involving the lungs, is responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide. Pneumonia is especially life-threatening in older people and people with other illnesses that may affect the immune system (such as diabetes). In addition to antibiotics, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been suggested as a possible option for treatment. G-CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells that fight infection, and is used for people with cancer after chemotherapy, and in febrile neutropenia (infection associated with very low levels of white cells). The review of trials found that, when combined with antibiotics, G-CSF appears to be a safe treatment for people with pneumonia, but it does not appear to reduce mortality. More research is needed to define the optimal timing of dosing (earlier, or prophylactically before the onset of infection) and possible problems when given to patients with severe infection.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-25 09:52:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a naturally-occurring cytokine that has been shown to increase neutrophil function and number. Exogenous administration of recombinant G-CSF (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim) has found extensive use in the treatment of febrile neutropenia, but its role in the treatment of infection in non-neutropenic hosts is less well defined.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>We explored the role of G-CSF as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia in non-neutropenic adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-25 09:52:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>For this updated review we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2006, issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to January 2007); EMBASE (1988 to January 2007); and online databases of clinical trials (www.controlled-trials.com, updated 10 November, 2006).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which included hospitalized adult patients with either community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The primary outcome measure was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcome measures included other markers of mortality as well as markers of adverse events, including organ dysfunction. An assessment of methodological quality was made for each study. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six studies with a total of 2018 people were identified. G-CSF use appeared to be safe with no increase in the incidence of total serious adverse events (pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.14) or organ dysfunction. However, the use of G-CSF was not associated with improved 28-day mortality (pooled OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.27). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no current evidence supporting the routine use of G-CSF in the treatment of pneumonia. Studies in which G-CSF is administered prophylactically or earlier in therapy may be of interest. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-21 21:32:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-21 21:32:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review explores the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia in non-neutropenic adults. Much of the mortality associated with pneumonia is related to sepsis, thought to represent a state of uncontrolled inflammation. Immunomodulation of this response, using physiological doses of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Annane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annane 2002</LINK>) and recombinant activated protein C (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2001</LINK>) have been associated with improved outcomes. G-CSF, a naturally occurring cytokine, may augment the neutrophil response to bacterial infections.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-21 21:32:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recombinant G-CSF (filgrastim, lenograstim) has been shown to increase proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil precursors. It has found widespread use in reducing the duration of febrile neutropenia following cytotoxic chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Welte-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welte 1996</LINK>), although its effect on mortality is questionable (<LINK REF="REF-Berghmans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghmans 2002</LINK>). Other accepted indications include neutropenia following bone marrow transplantation, the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells in healthy donors and in the treatment of severe congenital neutropenia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-08-21 21:32:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Its use in non-neutropenic bacterial infection is based on three possible mechanisms of action: (1) enhanced chemotaxis, superoxide production and bacterial killing activity (<LINK REF="REF-Hartung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartung 1999</LINK>); (2) immunomodulation of the cytokine response in sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1999</LINK>); and (3) a possible increase in intracellular uptake of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-McKenna-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, a possible concern with its use in sepsis is the role of neutrophils in the development of organ dysfunction, and in particular acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Increasing neutrophil number and function may increase the risk of these adverse sequelae. A review of 84 cases of probable G-CSF related pulmonary toxicity, mostly administered following chemotherapy, found that G-CSF might increase the toxicity associated with cytotoxic agents and infectious insults in neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Azoulay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azoulay 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>G-CSF has shown promise in the treatment of infection in non-neutropenic hosts in many animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1995</LINK>) and in at least one case series with a historical control group (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2002</LINK>). It should be distinguished from GM-CSF (sargramostim), which is used occasionally in stem cell mobilization and to promote engraftment following bone marrow transplantation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-08-21 21:26:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Community-acquired pneumonia is the leading cause of death from infectious disease and results in approximately 600,000 admissions per year in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1995</LINK>). Both community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia are associated with a significant mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niederman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niederman 1993</LINK>). A number of trials of G-CSF in the treatment of pneumonia have been performed. A review of these trials may clarify the role of this immunomodulatory therapy and aid design of future trials.</P>

<P>There has been controversy regarding the optimal definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993b</LINK>) and a paucity of studies of mortality. In general, hospital-acquired pneumonia is associated with a high mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993a</LINK>). In this review, we regard "hospital-acquired pneumonia" as a clinical definition (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 1988</LINK>):</P>

<P>Following the initial clinical trial, a subsequent trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2000</LINK>) included patients with community-acquired multilobar pneumonia, as the previous trial had suggested that this group, recognized as a group at higher risk for mortality, might have benefited from G-CSF. In this study (n = 480), there were fewer diabetics in the intervention group, but they were otherwise well balanced. The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of organ dysfunction, empyema or death. Mortality and markers of adverse events, including organ dysfunction was reported.</P>
<P>A small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wunderink-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wunderink 2001</LINK>; n = 18) was conducted specifically in patients with pneumonia and septic shock primarily to evaluate safety. Patients were randomized 2:1 to filgrastim (300 mcg / day for five days) or placebo and included patients with both community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Mortality at seven and 28 days as well as markers of adverse events including organ dysfunction was reported.</P>
<P>Following the safety analysis of the previous study, a large study (<LINK REF="STD-Root-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Root 2003</LINK>; n = 701) evaluated filgrastim (300 mcg / day for five days) in patients with severe sepsis and community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to intensive care. Neutropenic patients and those who had received chemotherapy were not excluded. Intervention and control groups were well balanced at baseline. Mortality at 28 days and total adverse events were reported. Unpublished data regarding specific rates of organ dysfunction was provided by the study sponsors (<LINK REF="REF-Foote-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foote 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fifth trial was initially identified as an abstract in German (with data obtained from correspondence with the authors (<LINK REF="REF-Kober-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kober 2004</LINK>)) and subsequently published (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 2005</LINK>; n = 29). This study enrolled patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia but was terminated early due to poor enrolment. G-CSF was administered according to a weight-based protocol (300 mcg / day for patients less than 75 kg, 480 mcg / day for patients more than 75 kg; for up to seven days). Mortality at 15 days was the primary endpoint but 30-day mortality was also reported. Rates of serious adverse events were sought, as were rates of ARDS.</P>
<P>A small sixth trial was conducted in Thailand in patients with severe sepsis due to suspected melioidosis (a tropical infection due to <I>Burkholderia pseudomallei (B. pseudomallei)</I>) (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>). Study subjects were allocated to receive lenograstim (263 mcg intravenously daily for three days). Although treatment allocation was by computer generated list and pre-prepared boxes, only treating clinicians and investigators were blinded to the treatment. Of the 60 patients enrolled, 36 had pneumonia and this data was included in this review; G-CSF was not associated with a mortality benefit in all patients, those with melioidosis or those with pneumonia. The primary outcome measure was 28-day mortality. Due to the short survival of patients in this study, adverse events were not able to be attributed to treatment.</P>
<P>The bacterial aetiology was similar in all studies, with <I>Streptococcus</I> <I>pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)</I> the most common organism found. In the studies of patients with septic shock, there was a greater proportion of <I>Staphylococcus</I> <I>aureus</I> (<I>S. aureus</I>) compared to <I>Haemophilus</I> <I>influenzae</I> (<I>H. influenzae</I>) reflecting the more severe illness that accompanies infection with <I>S. aureus. </I>Gram negative organisms predominated in the study of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 2005</LINK>) and the Thai study which enrolled patients with suspected melioidosis (due to <I>B. pseudomallei</I>) (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Ten studies were identified for detailed evaluation. Correspondence with the study sponsors confirms that a then-unpublished study of G-CSF in pneumococcal pneumonia referred to in Nelson (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2000</LINK>) refers to a subgroup of Root (<LINK REF="STD-Root-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Root 2003</LINK>). Of the remaining studies, one was not a randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hustinx-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hustinx 1998</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Meyanci-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meyanci 2001</LINK>) did not report clinical endpoints such as mortality and the rate of organ dysfunction and thus was excluded from further analysis. Another study reported primarily immunological endpoints following a single dose of filgrastim (<LINK REF="STD-Droemann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Droemann 2006</LINK>). A small pilot study was excluded as study subjects were administered a range of doses of G-CSF but no placebo group was included (<LINK REF="STD-deBoisblanc-1997" TYPE="STUDY">deBoisblanc 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>An initial clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>) excluded patients with septic shock, regarded as high risk for developing ARDS, and was conducted in multiple sites in North America and Australia. It included only patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Although patients were required to have two risk factors that had been demonstrated to be associated with increased mortality, patients with septic shock were specifically excluded. In this large study (n = 756), filgrastim (300 mcg / day for 10 days) and control groups were balanced with regard to risk factors. The primary end point was a composite measure of clinical findings ("time to resolution of morbidity"), but other endpoints were reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality and other efficacy endpoints</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies demonstrated a statistically significant mortality benefit; a pooled estimate of efficacy similarly did not demonstrate a significant benefit associated with G-CSF. There was some heterogeneity amongst studies with regard to 28-day mortality (P = 0.13, I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) = 41%) but this was not statistically significant. Pooling results across all five studies, the pooled odds ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.81 (random-effects model), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.27).</P>
<P>A number of the endpoints intended for analysis were not reported, including time to hospital discharge (no interquartile range reported in any study), the rate of intubation (only reported in <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>), in-hospital mortality (only reported in <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 2005</LINK>). Duration of ICU stay was not reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wunderink-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wunderink 2001</LINK>); in the remaining four studies, no differences were seen in median ICU stay which ranged from four days in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>) to 16 days in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 2005</LINK>), reflecting the severity of illness of each study population</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there was a reduction in adverse events that was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio was 0.79; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.23). This was largely due to a reduction in rates in organ dysfunction, highest in the study of community-acquired pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>). In that study, there was a significant decrease in rates of ARDS (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.28) but this was not seen in subsequent studies; overall use of G-CSF was not associated with a reduction in ARDS (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.93). When considering rates of individual organ dysfunction, there was a moderate decrease in the rates of disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.44), acute renal failure (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.31) and incident septic shock (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.09), but this was not statistically significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia</HEADING>
<P>Only two of the three studies that included patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia reported results by category. In the larger study (<LINK REF="STD-Root-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Root 2003</LINK>), patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia constituted a minority (20%) of patients and were distributed evenly in intervention and placebo groups.</P>

In these trials, however, septic shock was a specific exclusion; the pooled odds ratio of incident septic shock was 0.60 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.08). There was a moderate decrease in 28-day mortality in these trials (pooled OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22) that was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>There was a trend to an increasing odds ratio of serious adverse events and organ dysfunction in the studies of patients with severe sepsis in filgrastim-treated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Root-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Root 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wunderink-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wunderink 2001</LINK>). For total serious adverse events, the pooled odds ratio (random-effects) in the studies of patients with severe sepsis was 1.10 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.49) compared to the other studies (0.72; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01). Mortality was higher in the G-CSF groups in the largest trial that included severe sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Root-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Root 2003</LINK>, OR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.67, which did not exclude patients with neutropenia) but lower in the two small trials (OR 0.17, 0.12 respectively, not pooled due to clinical heterogeneity) (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 2005</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-22 16:44:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>This analysis suggests that G-CSF may be associated with a small mortality benefit, but there is considerable uncertainty with a plausible range of outcomes ranging from a 48% reduction in mortality odds to a 27% increase in mortality odds. Richard Root (<LINK REF="STD-Root-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Root 2003</LINK>) suggests several reasons for the failure of previous animal work to demonstrate a clear benefit in humans; invalid hypothesis, inadequate dosing or activity, improper study design or failed execution. He suggests that, primarily, delays in the administration of G-CSF to satisfy microbiological study criteria may have contributed to its negative result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Our results suggest that G-CSF does not increase the rates of immunologically mediated organ dysfunction by a clinically significant extent. A theoretical concern has been that the use of G-CSF may increase the rate of immunologically mediated end-organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to which patients with severe sepsis are particularly prone.</P>
<P>There was a trend towards an increasing risk of organ dysfunction in patients more severely unwell and treated with G-CSF, suggesting that this may have been due to an exacerbation of immunologically mediated disease in patients more at risk of developing organ dysfunction. However, this was not statistically significant in any study and remains speculative. The trend towards a reduction in incident septic shock in patients without this complication at study enrolment may suggest that G-CSF may be operating to prevent this complication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Decision to pool data from trials</HEADING>
<P>Despite the clinical heterogeneity present between the study populations, we felt it appropriate to pool the results to obtain an overall estimate of efficacy. It was felt that although the inclusion criteria were different, these patients all had varying severity of the same disease and thus the relative efficacy might be expected to remain the same in each group, although the absolute benefit (or harm) might be expected to vary with the mortality of the population studied. Differences in management, and more particularly antibiotics used, may have contributed to heterogeneity, but an analysis by antibiotic group was not possible. Similarly, it was felt that, although patients with severe sepsis may be a higher risk of developing this complication, the mechanism of end-organ dysfunction was the same.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Possible sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We felt that given the lack of effect demonstrated by the individual published trials, a significant publication bias is unlikely to be operating. However, it is possible that trials may have been withheld from publication due to harmful effects. We have no specific information suggesting this possibility.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently no evidence supporting the routine use of G-CSF in the treatment of pneumonia. There is no data on the use of G-CSF in subgroups such as diabetics that may manifest functional neutrophil deficits. We have not identified any methodological issues or biases that may have influenced our pooled results.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Clinical trials where G-CSF was administered earlier in the course of disease or perhaps even prophylactically to prevent hospital-acquired infection in high risk patients might be of interest. Similarly, studies of G-CSF for organisms where neutrophil function may be more important, or in hosts with co-morbid illnesses that may manifest acquired neutrophil dysfunction may be of interest. </P>
<P>Researchers are encouraged to report methodological parameters, such as generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow up as well as standardized outcome measures. A useful parameter that may have an impact on outcome, the proportion of patients on appropriate antibiotics within the first 24 hours of therapy, should also be reported.</P>
