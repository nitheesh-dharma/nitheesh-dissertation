<P>Not enough evidence to suggest that stopping an epidural late in labour lowers the risk of instrumental delivery or other unwanted outcomes.</P>
<P>Epidurals are used for pain relief in labour, but they increase the risk of instrumental delivery (vacuum/forceps). Stopping epidurals early aims to allow women to feel the pushing urge and so reduce the chance of having an instrumental birth and possible problems associated with such a birth. There is not enough evidence from the five included trials, involving 462 participants, to show whether stopping an epidural really does lower the risk of instrumental delivery or of any other unwanted outcome. The results show that women whose epidural is stopped report more pain than women whose epidural is continued until the birth of the baby. More research is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Although epidural analgesia provides the most effective labour analgesia, it is associated with some adverse obstetric consequences, including an increased risk of instrumental delivery. Many centres discontinue epidural analgesia late in labour to improve a woman's ability to push and reduce the rate of instrumental delivery.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the impact of discontinuing epidural analgesia late in labour on:<BR/>i) rates of instrumental deliveries and other delivery outcomes; and<BR/>ii) analgesia and satisfaction with labour care.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (October 2007). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of epidurals discontinued late in labour compared with continuation of the same epidural protocol until birth, in women who receive an epidural for analgesia in the first stage of labour.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality and extracted the data. We analysed categorical data using relative risk (RR), and continuous data using weighted mean difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified six studies, of which five were included (462 participants). Three of these were high-quality studies whilst the other two were judged to be of lower quality because placebo was not used and the method of randomisation not described. All studies used different epidural analgesia protocols (type of drug, dosage or method of administration). Overall, the reduction in instrumental delivery rate was not statistically significant (23% versus 28%, RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.15) nor was there any statistically significant difference in rates of other delivery outcomes. The only statistically significant result was an increase in inadequate pain relief when the epidural was stopped (22% versus 6%, RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.99 to 6.80).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that discontinuing epidural analgesia late in labour reduces the rate of instrumental delivery. There is evidence that it increases the rate of inadequate pain relief in the second stage of labour. The practice of discontinuing epidurals is widespread and the size of the reduction in instrumental delivery rate could be clinically important; therefore, we recommend a larger study than those included in this review be undertaken to determine whether this effect is real or has occurred by chance, and to provide stronger evidence about the safety aspects. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-02-12 10:17:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>In high-income countries most women giving birth use some method of pain relief during labour. Epidural analgesia provides the most effective labour analgesia and its use for labour and childbirth has increased dramatically over the past 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leighton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leighton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002</LINK>). However, a Cochrane Systematic Review shows that compared to other forms of analgesia, epidurals are also associated with some adverse obstetric consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2005</LINK>). These include a longer second stage of labour, increased use of oxytocin augmentation, and an increased risk of instrumental delivery, urinary retention and fever. The increased risk of instrumental delivery for women receiving epidural analgesia (relative risk 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.53) is of particular concern (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2005</LINK>). High rates of instrumental deliveries are associated with increased risks for mothers of vaginal/perineal trauma and anal sphincter damage, resulting in urinary incontinence, bowel and sexual problems (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eason-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johanson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacArthur-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacArthur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Several mechanisms for the increase in instrumental deliveries associated with epidural analgesia have been postulated including relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles, which may delay the rotation of the head, a weakened desire to push due to diminution of the bearing down reflex and reduced uterine activity (<LINK REF="REF-Bates-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayberry-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayberry 1999</LINK>). Discontinuing the epidural late in labour aims to improve a woman's ability to push during second stage and thereby reduce instrumental deliveries associated with epidural analgesia. In surveys of delivery wards, the practice of letting the epidural wear off has been reported as ranging from 42% to 89% (<LINK REF="REF-Paech-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paech 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandendriesen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandendriesen 1998</LINK>). A 1992 systematic review of discontinuing epidural block at 8 cm dilatation included only one trial (92 women) and concluded that allowing the epidural to 'wear off' at the end of the first stage of labour caused a significant increase in pain during the second stage but this was accompanied by a reduced incidence of instrumental delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Howell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Satisfaction with childbirth is not necessarily contingent upon the absence of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ranta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranta 1995</LINK>). Many women are willing to experience pain in childbirth but do not want pain to overwhelm them. Antenatally, 82% of women wish to see how labour progresses and only want analgesia when pain becomes severe or intolerable (<LINK REF="REF-Ranta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranta 1995</LINK>). Consequently, when assessing the effectiveness of labour analgesia, it may be as important to assess satisfaction with labour care as the level of analgesia or anaesthesia achieved.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded study</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1983</LINK>) was excluded because for 27% of the study participants, the reason for the epidural was obstetric or medical rather than analgesia (<I>see</I> Table of 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). In addition, this trial was of poor methodological quality. Participants were randomised by shuffling sheets and it was not placebo controlled. When the fetal head was below the ischial spines, no further top-ups of bupivacaine 0.25% were given to women in the study group. There was no significant difference in the total dose of bupivacaine received by women in the study and control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>Five studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK>) with a total of 462 participants (<I>see</I> Table of 'Characteristics of included studies'). All participants were women in labour with their first baby, which was a term singleton fetus of vertex presentation. All the studies except <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK> specified that the women were healthy or had uncomplicated pregnancies, or both. All women had epidural analgesia initiated in the first stage of labour. The epidural infusion or top-ups were then either stopped or replaced with a study solution (either the same solution or saline) late in labour. Four studies specified that this occurred either at at least eight centimetres or more than eight centimetres whilst <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK> stated that the study group were without infusion analgesia in the second stage but did not specify exactly when it was switched off.</P>
<P>In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>), the continuous epidural infusion solution syringe was substituted with a syringe containing the study solution when the woman's cervix was eight or more centimetres dilated. These studies were methodologically almost identical, all involving replacing the continuous epidural infusion solution with a study solution which contained either the same drug or a placebo (saline). The differences between these studies were the drug(s) used in the epidural solution. <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK> used 0.75% lidocaine, <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK> used 0.125% bupivacaine and <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK> used a low-dose local anaesthetic plus an opioid (0.0625% bupivacaine plus 0.0002% fentanyl). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK>) women receiving a continuous epidural infusion were also studied but, unlike the Chestnut studies, there was no placebo. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK>) used intermittent boluses, commonly referred to as 'top-ups'. The women in the study group did not receive any more top-ups after the cervix was eight centimetres dilated, whilst the women in the control group continued to receive top-ups until delivery. In this study, labour was managed actively, using routine amniotomy on admission for all women not presenting with spontaneous rupture of membranes and oxytocin was given when cervical dilatation was less than one centimetre per hour.</P>

The patient, anaesthesiologist, obstetrician, paediatrician, and nursing staff were unaware of the identity of the study solution. These three studies did have exclusions which were due to protocol violations or because a caesarean section was performed after the initiation of the epidural but before substitution of the epidural infusion solution with the study solution (between 11% and 18% of eligible study participants).

<P>Five studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK>) with a total of 462 participants.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Incidence of instrumental delivery</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported the incidence of instrumental delivery. The overall incidence of instrumental delivery varied considerably among the studies, from 15% in <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> to 35% in <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>. The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant reduction in the incidence of instrumental deliveries (23% versus 28%, relative risk (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.15).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Incidence of caesarean section</HEADING>
<P>All studies except <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK> reported the number of caesarean sections performed postrandomisation. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the rate of caesarean sections (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.25). It should be noted that, overall, caesarean section was an infrequent outcome, occurring in only 18 of the 282 (6%) participants in whom it was reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Incidence of spontaneous vaginal delivery</HEADING>
<P>The three Chestnut studies reported the number of spontaneous vaginal deliveries and in <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> it was possible to calculate this by subtracting the number of instrumental deliveries plus caesarean sections from the total number of deliveries. <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK> did not report the number of caesarean sections, therefore we were unable to calculate the incidence of spontaneous vaginal delivery for that study. Meta-analysis of spontaneous vaginal deliveries showed no significant difference (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.30).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(4) Duration of the second stage of labour</HEADING>
<P>All studies compared the length of second stage of labour between the study and control group but only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK>), with 203 participants in total, reported the mean duration in minutes with standard deviation. Meta-analysis of these three studies showed no statistically significant or clinically important difference in the length of second stage (weighted mean difference (WMD) -5.80 minutes, 95% CI -12.91 to 1.30). It should be noted that the assumptions of the analysis may have been violated due to duration of second stage of labour often being non-normally distributed as a result of a few women having very long second stages. In addition, there is some heterogeneity in this outcome (I-squared statistic = 41.8%) One other study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK>) reported no significant difference in mean length of second stage (37 minutes versus 38 minutes) but could not be included in the meta-analysis because no standard deviation was reported. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>) reported median length of second stage and found no significant difference (63 minutes versus 53 minutes).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(5) Incidence of fetal malposition at delivery</HEADING>
<P>All studies except <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> reported the number of persistent fetal malpositions (occipitoposterior and occipitotransverse positions plus one case of deflection). Of the 388 participants in whom this was measured, 36 (9%) had persistent malpositions. No studies showed any significant difference between the study and control group with a pooled relative risk of 1.36 (95% CI 0.73 to 2.56).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(6) Reporting of inadequate pain relief during the second stage of labour</HEADING>
<P>All studies except <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> reported a measure of pain relief. We defined inadequate pain relief as either 'poor' or 'very poor' on a five point scale or 'poor' on a four point scale. Meta-analysis of the four studies (384 participants) found a statistically significant increase in inadequate pain relief in the study group (22% versus 6%, RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.99 to 6.80).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(7) Maternal dissatisfaction with labour care</HEADING>
<P>This outcome was not reported in any of the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(8) Incidence of low Apgar score at one minute</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported Apgar scores at one minute. <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> did not report the number of babies with low Apgar scores so we were unable to include this study in our meta-analyses. However, <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> did report that there was no significant difference in mean Apgar scores (9.6 versus 9.3). Of the four studies included in the meta-analysis (388 participants), the three Chestnut papers reported the number of babies with Apgar scores less than seven whilst <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK> reported the number of babies with Apgar scores less than eight. Of these 388 participants, 57 (15%) had low Apgar scores (defined as either less than 7 or less than 8) at one minute. Meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.55).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(9) Incidence of low Apgar score at five minutes</HEADING>
<P>Only the three Chestnut studies reported the number of babies with low Apgar scores at five minutes. Of the 208 participants, only three had an Apgar score of less than seven at five minutes (RR 3.92, 95% CI 0.45 to 34.21). <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK> reported no difference in mean Apgar scores between the two groups at five minutes (10 in both groups). <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK> did not report Apgar scores at five minutes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(10) Incidence of admission to neonatal intensive care unit</HEADING>
<P>This outcome was not reported in any of the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(11) Incidence of low umbilical arterial pH</HEADING>
<P>The three Chestnut studies measured umbilical arterial pH. There was no significant difference between the two groups in any study, nor in the meta-analysis (208 participants, WMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) By type of epidural analgesia (intermittent bolus, continuous infusion or combined spinal epidural)</HEADING>
<P>Four studies used a continuous epidural infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK>), one (<LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK>) used intermittent boluses (top-ups), and none used combined spinal epidural. There was no evidence that the intervention had different effects on these subgroups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) By type of analgesic agent (local anaesthetic alone versus local anaesthetic plus opioid)</HEADING>
<P>Four studies used a local anaesthetic alone in their epidurals (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsrud-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsrud 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luxman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luxman 1996</LINK>), and one used a local anaesthetic plus an opioid (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>). The only outcome which changed when the analysis was restricted to epidurals using a local anaesthetic alone was the incidence of low Apgar score at one minute, which increased in the study group and just reached statistical significance (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.03).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review is limited by the small number of studies and participants, and the only confident conclusion to be drawn is that discontinuing epidural analgesia late in labour increases the rate of inadequate pain relief during the second stage of labour. Whilst it is possible that discontinuing epidural analgesia reduces the incidence of instrumental delivery, at present there is insufficient evidence to accept or refute this. A 16% reduction in instrumental delivery rates may be clinically important, but a much larger study than any of those included in this review would be needed to determine the real impact of the intervention. The only study (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1987b</LINK>) in which the intervention group had a significantly shorter second stage of labour was also the only study where the study group had a significantly lower rate of instrumental delivery and a significantly higher rate of inadequate pain relief, suggesting that there may be a trade-off between satisfactory analgesia during the second stage and an increased risk of instrumental delivery. This was also the study with the highest overall instrumental delivery rates.</P>
<P>The management of women with epidural analgesia and the type and dosage of drug varies between hospitals, countries and over time. All the studies in this review used different epidural analgesia protocols. Although our subgroup analyses did not show any significant differences, the effect of discontinuing epidural analgesia late in labour may not be the same under all conditions. The last high-quality trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chestnut-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chestnut 1990</LINK>) was undertaken 14 years ago, and practices have changed since then. Second stage management strategies which have the potential to reduce instrumental delivery rates among women with epidural analgesia include the use of an upright position, delayed pushing, and no upper limit on the length of second stage in the absence of maternal or fetal distress and as long as progress is being made. </P>
<P>The practice of discontinuing epidural analgesia for the second stage of labour is widespread, and many women may be experiencing increased pain during their second stage of labour when there is no evidence of any benefit, and there is the possibility of an increased risk of low Apgar score at one minute. Whilst an increase in pain may be acceptable to some women if accompanied by a reduced risk of instrumental delivery or other adverse outcome, women are unlikely to find it acceptable when not accompanied by any benefit. The effect of discontinuing epidurals on women's satisfaction with labour care is unknown as no study reported this outcome. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At present there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that discontinuing epidural analgesia reduces the incidence of instrumental delivery, but there is evidence that it increases women's pain. Whenever possible, women should be informed of the risks and benefits of discontinuing epidural analgesia, and encouraged to participate in the decision of whether to discontinue or not.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A large, well conducted randomised controlled trial is required to determine whether discontinuing epidural analgesia reduces the incidence of instrumental delivery, as well as being effective, safe and acceptable to women and staff.</P>
