<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Community animal health services for improving household wealth and health status of low-income farmers</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Livestock are central to the household economy for some communities in low-income and middle-income countries. The availability of basic veterinary services could contribute to the wealth and health of households by preventing animal illness or death. In most low-income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the state provided free veterinary services during the years in which countries were colonized, and for some time after their independence. However, since the 1960s privately (or self) employed veterinarians are slowly replacing government veterinary services. Privatized veterinary services, modelled on European or North American systems, have had mixed success in that they seem to have worked well in urban areas, but not in remote arid and semi-arid areas of the world, where livestock herding is very extensive and people do not have money to pay for the services. While the provision of community animal health services seems common sense, very no well-designed randomized controlled trials nor any controlled before-and-after studies have evaluated its impact. Such studies are needed to substantiate the positive results reported it several observational studies. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-05 16:22:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Livestock are central to the household economy for some communities in low-income and middle-income countries. The availability of basic veterinary services could contribute to the wealth and health of households by preventing animal illness or death. Since the 1970s, governmental and nongovernmental organizations have provided resources for low-income countries to implement community animal health services. Low-income farmers are defined as farmers earning less than 755 USD per year.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">History of community animal health services</HEADING>
<P>In most low-income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the state provided free veterinary services during the years in which countries were colonized and for some time after their independence (<LINK REF="REF-Schillhorn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schillhorn 1995</LINK>). However, since the 1960s there has been a decrease in public sector funding, which also affected veterinary services (<LINK REF="REF-Odeyemi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odeyemi 1994</LINK>). In the 1980s and 1990s, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund encouraged national governments to privatize a large proportion of state services, including the veterinary services (<LINK REF="REF-Leonard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 1993</LINK>). Privately (or self) employed veterinarians replaced the government veterinary services.</P>
<P>Privatized veterinary services, modelled on European or North American systems, have been established in some parts of the world with more or less success (Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Production Union, personal communication, 1999). They have worked especially well in urban areas (<LINK REF="REF-Mpelumbe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mpelumbe 1994</LINK>). They have not worked well in remote arid and semi-arid areas of the world, where livestock herding is very extensive and people do not have money to pay for the services (<LINK REF="REF-Odeyemi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odeyemi 1994</LINK>). Before privatization, the state run service and governments trained a hierarchy of locally recruited veterinary auxiliaries or veterinary scouts, the original community animal health service. These were people who received up to three years training in animal health and disease surveillance, and were responsible for dispensing animal health care and for notifying the veterinary authorities of disease outbreaks. As the funding decreased, many of these veterinary auxiliaries and scouts were made redundant and turned to other employment.</P>
<P>The benefits of these community animal health services have since been recognized. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations, working in collaboration with national government livestock and veterinary departments, have revived the concept of the community animal health worker as deliverer of community animal health services in remote rural areas (<LINK REF="STD-Huttner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Huttner 2000</LINK>). Typically in these community animal health services, the community animal health worker does not receive a salary from the state but is given money through the programme for a limited time. The aims are for the community animal health worker to make a living by selling his or her livestock services, and the programmes to become self-sustaining. These community animal health workers go by many different names, such as 'community (based) animal health workers', 'paravets', 'barefoot vets', or 'animal health auxiliaries'. Their skills vary according to their training but generally include correct administration of vaccines, antibiotics, anthelmintic drugs, acaricidal drugs, and trypanocidal drugs in addition to husbandry, nutrition, and management knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Hadrill-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hadrill 1982</LINK>). The community animal health worker is usually provided with a start-up kit of veterinary drugs and equipment and is supported by the establishment of a rural pharmacy to replenish stocks (<LINK REF="REF-Muir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muir 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Community animal health workers have been delivering community animal health services in Africa, Asia, and Latin America since the 1970s. While the provision of community animal health services seems common sense, very little work has evaluated its impact. The organizations that train and support the community animal health workers have been monitoring their work and attempting to evaluate the extent of their impact on the health of livestock and on the welfare of farmers (<LINK REF="REF-Matti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matti 2000</LINK>). Until this Cochrane Review there was no systematic analysis of the evaluation and impact assessment reports of community animal health services. This means we did not know the extent of the impact of the community animal health workers on farmers and their livestock.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Benefits and harms</HEADING>
<P>Community animal health services can help farmers who rely heavily or exclusively on livestock for their income by keeping the animals healthy and productive. For example, community animal health workers can treat livestock for chronic conditions such as worms or tick infestations that decrease the animals' productivity. They can also vaccinate herds against diseases that can kill entire herds, such as rinderpest.</P>
<P>Community animal health services could also be harmful to vulnerable farmers. The community animal health workers must attempt to make a living from selling their services, which include veterinary drugs. They may attempt to sell the farmer drugs that he does not need, increase the cost of the drugs, or dilute the drugs in order to make or save money. The community animal health service may draw farmers away from using traditional medicines (ethnoveterinary medicines) in order to make money from encouraging the use of conventional medicines. The loss of indigenous knowledge is culturally harmful.<BR/>
<BR/>This review summarizes the available evidence on the effects of community animal health services from randomized controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies. We have summarized relevant information from other study designs in a separate article (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-Curran-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin Curran 2002b</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although no studies met the inclusion criteria, we summarized the available evidence from the 14 studies excluded in the original version of this review in <LINK REF="REF-Martin-Curran-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin Curran 2002b</LINK>. These studies generally reported that community animal health services can have a positive impact on human health and wealth, and animal health and productivity, but they were generally of low methodological quality and used a range of outcomes and study designs. Given the amount of money and time invested in this area, and the potential benefits for low-income communities, funders and implementing agencies should insist that future studies should be well designed and use common pragmatic outcomes. The studies should also use a framework to determine whether community animal health services are a cost effective way of improving health in low-income communities dependent on livestock.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of community animal health services for improving human health and wealth has not been evaluated in a well-designed randomized controlled trial or before-and-after study, and therefore, is not supported by reliable evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Well-designed randomized controlled trials or controlled before-and-after studies that use standard pragmatic outcomes are needed to evaluate the positive results reported by observational studies.</P>
