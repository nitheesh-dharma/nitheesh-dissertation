Reduced fitness causes increased tiredness, which makes everyday activities harder to do. Health professionals use fitness training to address this problem. This is an update to a review first published in 2008, which aimed to evaluate how effective fitness training is at improving fitness, other outcomes such as depression, cognition (e.g. memory, attention and problem solving) and return to everyday activities.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We searched for studies in August 2017. We included eight studies, involving 399 adults with traumatic brain injuries, in this review. Most study participants were men in their mid-thirties who had severe brain injuries. We found no studies that included children. The fitness training programmes were conducted in a range of settings including hospital, community and at home. In six of the eight studies all fitness training sessions were supervised. The type of fitness training varied, and included exercising on a fixed cycling machine, in water, on gym equipment such as a treadmill, home-based exercise, and a fitness group in the military. In six of the eight studies the prescribed intensity, duration and frequency of fitness training met the guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Three of the eight studies, with 67 participants, assessed change in fitness at the end of the treatment programme. Exercise was conducted on a fixed cycling machine in two studies, and in water in the third, and all sessions were supervised. The fitness training was compared to non-exercise interventions in two of these studies, and to no intervention in the third study. We combined the results of the three studies, which demonstrated an average (mean) improvement of 35 watts on an exercise test in the fitness training groups compared to the non-exercise intervention and no intervention groups. This improvement represents approximately a 36% improvement in fitness from the start of the study, which is a large effect. However, this estimate is uncertain and the difference is likely to be between 3 to 68 watts, which may or may not be important clinically.</P><P>More than one study reported on six other outcomes; body composition, strength, tiredness, depression, quality of life and walking. It was unclear whether fitness training was better or worse than the non-exercise interventions or no intervention at improving these outcomes. Measures of cognition, activities of daily living, and return to everyday activities were only measured in one study, and there were no studies that measured the effect of fitness training on levels of physical activity and motivation. Only three studies examined the effect of fitness training beyond the end of the programme, but these could not provide a clear answer regarding the long-term effects of fitness training.</P><P>In the five studies that provided supervision for all fitness training sessions, all participants in the fitness training groups completed the studies. Treatment attendance varied between studies, and was reported as ranging from 59% to 100%, and was not reported for two studies. There was no evidence of harm caused by fitness training in any study.</P><P><B>Quality of evidence</B></P><P>Our certainty in these findings is reduced due to the low quality of the evidence caused by small numbers of study participants, poor reporting of some study details, and possible errors in the way some of the studies were carried out.</P><P><B>Authors&#8217; conclusions</B></P><P>It is unclear whether fitness training after a traumatic brain injury improves physical fitness. There is not enough evidence to understand the effect of fitness training on other important outcomes. Whilst fitness training appears to be well attended by people with traumatic brain injury, particularly when supervised, and there is no evidence of harm, further well-designed studies are required before we can draw any definite conclusions. In the absence of high quality evidence, health professionals may be guided by pre-exercise screening checklists to ensure the person with traumatic brain injury is safe to exercise, and to set training parameters using guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine for people who have suffered a brain injury.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-12-21 09:26:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-20 15:49:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (cardiorespiratory deconditioning) is a common consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The secondary objectives were to evaluate whether fitness training improves body function and structure (physical and cognitive impairments, psychological responses resulting from the injury), activity limitations and participation restrictions in people who have sustained a TBI as well as to evaluate its safety, acceptance, feasibility and suitability.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-10 16:26:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Injuries Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Embase; PubMed (MEDLINE); CINAHL; AMED; SPORTDiscus; PsycINFO; PEDro and PsycBITE) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for relevant trials. In addition we screened reference lists from systematic reviews related to the topic that we identified from our search, and from the included studies, and contacted trialists to identify further studies. The search was run in August 2017.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-12-20 15:46:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Randomised controlled studies with TBI participants were eligible if they compared an exercise programme incorporating cardiorespiratory fitness training to usual care, a non-exercise intervention, or no intervention.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-11-14 15:10:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two authors independently screened the search results, extracted data and assessed bias. We contacted all trialists for additional information. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and odds ratio with 95% CI for dichotomous data. We pooled data when there were sufficient studies with homogeneity.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-12-20 15:52:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two new studies incorporating 96 participants were identified in this update and were added to the six previously included studies. A total of eight studies incorporating 399 participants are included in the updated review. The participants were primarily men aged in their mid-thirties who had sustained a severe TBI. No studies included children. The studies were clinically diverse with regard to the interventions, time postinjury and the outcome measures used. At the end of intervention, the mean difference in peak power output was 35.47 watts (W) in favour of fitness training (MD 35.47 W, 95% CI 2.53 to 68.41 W; 3 studies, 67 participants; low-quality evidence). The CIs include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there was moderate heterogeneity among the studies.</P><P>Five of the secondary outcomes had sufficient data at the end of intervention to enable meta-analysis: body composition (SMD 0.29 standard deviations (favouring control), 95% CI -0.22 to 0.79; 2 studies, 61 participants; low-quality evidence), strength (SMD -0.02 (favouring control), 95% CI -0.86 to 0.83; 2 studies, 23 participants; very low-quality evidence), fatigue (SMD -0.32 (favouring fitness training), 95% CI -0.90 to 0.26; 3 studies, 130 participants; very low-quality evidence), depression (SMD -0.43 (favouring fitness training), 95% CI -0.92 to 0.06; 4 studies, 220 participants; very low-quality evidence), and neuromotor function (MD 0.01 m (favouring fitness training), 95% CI -0.25 to 0.27; 2 studies, 109 participants; moderate-quality evidence). It was uncertain whether fitness training was more or less effective at improving these secondary outcomes compared to the control interventions. Quality of life was assessed in three trials, but we did not pool the data because of substantial heterogeneity. Five of the eight included studies had no dropouts from their intervention group and no adverse events were reported in any study.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-21 09:26:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is low-quality evidence that fitness training is effective at improving cardiorespiratory deconditioning after TBI; there is insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions about the other outcomes. Whilst the intervention appears to be accepted by people with TBI, and there is no evidence of harm, more adequately powered and well-designed studies are required to determine a more precise estimate of the effect on cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as the effects across a range of important outcome measures and in people with different characteristics (e.g. children). In the absence of high quality evidence, clinicians may be guided by pre-exercise screening checklists to ensure the person with traumatic brain injury is safe to exercise, and set training parameters using guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine for people who have suffered a brain injury.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-12-21 09:21:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-20 10:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-12-20 10:40:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term limitation of activity globally (<LINK REF="REF-Hyder-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyder 2007</LINK>). The reported incidence of TBI ranges from 108 to 392 per 100,000 population (<LINK REF="REF-Abelson_x002d_Mitchell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abelson-Mitchell 2008</LINK>), with most of these injuries classified as mild (<LINK REF="REF-Hyder-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyder 2007</LINK>). Although TBI has a lower incidence than some other health conditions, such as stroke, it primarily affects people in the prime of their life. The prevalence, economic and social cost of TBI is extensive, with an estimated total direct and indirect cost in the USA of between USD 34 and 76 billion annually (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2014</LINK>). In addition, the World Health Organization anticipates the incidence of TBI will grow due to motor vehicle accidents in developing countries and ongoing military conflicts (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2014</LINK>). It is therefore important to optimise the health of people with TBI throughout their lives.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-12-20 10:41:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Cardiorespiratory fitness training is one method of optimising health. Fitness training is a type of leisure-time physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposive in the sense that it has as an objective the improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Caspersen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caspersen 1985</LINK>). The American College of Sports Medicine has published exercise guidelines for people with a brain injury; these recommend exercising at a frequency of three to five times per week, at an intensity of 40% to 70% of peak oxygen uptake, or a 13/20 Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), and for a duration of 20 to 60 minutes using an appropriate mode of exercise (e.g. walking, swimming, cycling) that will depend upon the individual's physical ability (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer_x002d_McLean-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer-McLean 2009</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-12-20 10:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Regular physical activity and a high fitness level are associated with a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality globally (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>). However, people with TBI have been shown to be less physically active than the able-bodied population (<LINK REF="REF-Hassett-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassett 2015</LINK>), and to have low fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Hassett-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassett 2016</LINK>). In a recent narrative review conducted by our team that proposed a causative model of reduced fitness in people with TBI, we pooled data from 11 studies that measured peak oxygen uptake in 234 adults with TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Hassett-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassett 2016</LINK>). The average peak oxygen uptake was 27.2 mL·kg<SUP>-1</SUP>·min<SUP>-1 </SUP>which is well below the lowest fitness levels for adults of a similar age and gender (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2014</LINK>). Reasons why people with TBI may be less physically active and unfit are multifactorial and can include the physical and cognitive impairments and psychological responses that result from their injury, as well as environmental and societal barriers (<LINK REF="REF-Hassett-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassett 2016</LINK>). For example, it may be difficult to go outside to walk due to both the physical impairment of poor balance and an environmental barrier such as an uneven footpath. The cognitive impairment of diminished drive and the emotional disorder of depression may also make those with TBI less likely to initiate exercise or want to leave their home to go for a walk. It is therefore necessary to investigate fitness training interventions to increase physical activity for people who have sustained a TBI.</P><P>Fitness training programmes in unfit - but otherwise healthy - individuals have demonstrated improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness of approximately 12% for light (24% to 39% heart rate reserve) to moderate (40% to 59% heart rate reserve) intensity programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Swain-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swain 2005</LINK>). In healthy able-bodied people, fitness training improves cardiorespiratory fitness by improving both central and peripheral determinants (<LINK REF="REF-Rowell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowell 1974</LINK>). Centrally, cardiorespiratory fitness training of sufficient intensity increases heart stroke volume and decreases heart rate at a set submaximal load; and peripherally, training increases muscle oxidative capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Rowell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowell 1974</LINK>). It is likely that similar mechanisms would increase fitness in people with TBI, but this has not been tested empirically.</P><P>Participation in regular fitness training may not only improve cardiorespiratory fitness (thereby reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality), but may also specifically improve some of the common physical and psychosocial sequelae of TBI. These include fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Bushnik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushnik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ponsford-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponsford 2014</LINK>), impaired cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Novack-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novack 2000</LINK>), depression (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1998</LINK>), and poor community integration (<LINK REF="REF-Doig-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doig 2001</LINK>). Physical fatigue is associated with impairments in physiological efficiency, muscle strength and oxidative capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Jankowski-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankowski 1990</LINK>). Improvements in fitness (i.e. improvements in the oxidative capacity) increase the reserve capacity (i.e. peak oxygen capacity minus resting oxygen capacity); thus, for the same given activity a fitter person will be working at a lower percentage of their peak oxygen capacity and, as such, will report the activity as less fatiguing.</P><P>Cognitive impairments after TBI have a characteristic form, with a pattern of deficits in memory functioning, cognitive processing speeds, reasoning skills and concentration, although individual differences are evident (<LINK REF="REF-Novack-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novack 2000</LINK>). These impairments are a direct result of the trauma to the brain and are associated with neuronal activity disruption and changes in oxidative metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Grealy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grealy 1999</LINK>). The rationale for the possibility that cardiorespiratory fitness training might improve cognition comes from animal and neuropsychological research. This shows that regular physical activity can affect cognition positively by increasing cerebral blood flow and neurotransmitter levels and bringing about structural changes in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Etnier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etnier 1997</LINK>). Thus it seems plausible that cardiorespiratory fitness training may improve cognitive function in people with TBI.</P><P>Depression is one of the major emotional disorders that can follow moderate to severe TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Satz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satz 1998</LINK>); it is thought to be a primary barrier to achieving optimal rehabilitation goals (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1998</LINK>). The reported incidence of depression after TBI varies, ranging from 10% to 77% (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1998</LINK>). The mechanism for the development of depression has been difficult to determine, due to the diverse sequelae seen after TBI and, in some cases, the complicating premorbid factors such as unemployment and substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1998</LINK>). It has been postulated that fitness training may be an under-used adjunct to current pharmacological and psychological therapies that address depression (<LINK REF="REF-Paluska-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paluska 2000</LINK>). Cardiorespiratory fitness training may have psychological effects such as positive feedback from other people, an increased sense of self-worth, mastery of a new skill and social contact (<LINK REF="REF-Lawlor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawlor 2001</LINK>). Physiological mechanisms may also contribute, particularly as exercise increases the release of endorphins and mono-amines, which increase feelings of well-being. It is probably a combination of these psychological and physiological components in a psychobiological model that best explains the potential mechanisms of fitness training on depression (<LINK REF="REF-Paluska-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paluska 2000</LINK>).</P><P>'Community integration' refers to effective performance of a role in the community setting (<LINK REF="REF-Burleigh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burleigh 1998</LINK>), and encompasses integration in three areas, namely social network, home, and productive activities (<LINK REF="REF-Willer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willer 1993</LINK>). A study of TBI survivors two to five years after discharge from rehabilitation showed that 40% still performed poorly in all three areas of community integration (<LINK REF="REF-Doig-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doig 2001</LINK>). Cardiorespiratory fitness training can serve an important role in improving community integration. Firstly, it has an impact on societal and familial re-integration by improving the person's ability to perform regular physical activity with family or friends, such as walking or jogging, and generally participating in socially acceptable activities regardless of their other deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1990</LINK>). Secondly, by reducing fatigue levels and improving cardiorespiratory fitness, the person with TBI may be more able to cope with returning to their everyday activities including vocational activities (<LINK REF="REF-Jankowski-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankowski 1990</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-21 02:32:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several randomised controlled studies have examined the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness training as an intervention for people who have sustained a TBI (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK>), however this intervention has not been subject to rigorous review. For this reason a systematic review was required to investigate these studies comprehensively to determine whether there are any benefits or harms of cardiorespiratory fitness training in this population, and to highlight gaps in the evidence. The original version of this review was published on the Cochrane Library in 2008 and the findings were unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Hassett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassett 2008</LINK>).

Participants could have any severity of injury; where there were data available, we have indicated the injury severity of participants in each study. Injury severity rating was based on the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1961</LINK>), and coma, as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jennett-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennett 1981</LINK>).

While we did not exclude studies if they did not report exercise intensity of at least 40% peak oxygen uptake or a rate of perceived exertion of 13/20, it had to be clear that the intention of the exercise programme was cardiorespiratory fitness training.

We included studies that included other types of exercise such as resistance, flexibility or neuromotor exercises in conjunction with cardiorespiratory fitness training. The exercise programme was either prescribed in isolation or as a component of a rehabilitation package.</P><P>For studies to be included in the review, the comparator intervention had to be usual care, a non-exercise intervention or no intervention. Usual care could include physical rehabilitation, however it could not include fitness training prescribed at a similar dose to the exercise intervention.

We summarised the available data on these outcomes, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the quality of evidence in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.

For continuous outcomes, the after-intervention score (range in studies included in the comparison) was used to illustrate the assumed risk in the control group and the MD or SMD and 95% CI were used to illustrate the corresponding risk with fitness training. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) has not been determined for the primary outcome (cardiorespiratory fitness - peak power output) in people with TBI or a similar population.

We downgraded the quality of the evidence for this outcome to low due to risk of bias of the included studies and imprecision of the estimate of effect. There was a mean improvement of 35.47 W on an exercise test in the fitness training intervention compared to the control intervention, however this estimate was imprecise with 95% CI 2.53 to 68.41 W. The mean improvement of 35 W represents approximately a 36% improvement in fitness from baseline measurement (average baseline peak power output across the three studies = 97 W). Although a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) has not been determined for this measure in this or similar populations, in people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - whose baseline power output is approximately one-third of the baseline power output in the included studies - MCID has been determined to be 4 W (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011</LINK>). Taking this into consideration, the confidence intervals are likely to include both a substantial clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect.

The identified studies incorporated clinically diverse interventions implemented at incongruent times postinjury, and measured an array of outcomes using a number of different measurement tools. The clinical and methodological diversity among studies and the number of single study outcomes prevented pooling of the results for all but seven of the outcomes evaluated in the included studies. In addition, when studies were pooled, the quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate, low or very low. Consequently, there is uncertainty regarding our results, which renders it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of cardiorespiratory fitness training after TBI.</P><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-12-20 12:43:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome</HEADING><P>The primary objective was to investigate whether fitness training improves cardiorespiratory fitness in people who have sustained a TBI. The gold standard measure for cardiorespiratory fitness in this population is peak oxygen uptake, but only one of the three included studies that assessed cardiorespiratory fitness used this measure (<LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK>). The other two studies (and the <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK> study) used an indirect measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, i.e. peak power output achieved during a submaximal incremental test to a predetermined endpoint (i.e. percentage of predicted maximum heart rate) (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK>). The mean difference between groups for the three included studies in this analysis was 35.5 W which is probably a clinically important difference. However the 95% confidence interval ranged from 2.5 to 68.4 W, highlighting the imprecision of this estimate and that the effect may not be clinically relevant. Only one of the three studies showed a positive effect; this study recruited participants who were in the chronic phase, and were more than three years postinjury on average (<LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK>). In contrast, one of the studies that did not show a clear effect implemented fitness training during acute inpatient rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>), with participants who were, on average, less than six months postinjury. Participants in both the intervention and control groups of that study may still have been improving acutely, since the first three to six months postinjury is considered to be the period with the most rapid recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Ponsford-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponsford 2014</LINK>). Hence, this may have reduced any potential difference between groups. Further studies are required to investigate fitness training in both the acute and chronic stages of recovery and to measure peak oxygen uptake to determine if fitness training is more effective at particular times in the rehabilitation process.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes (impairments in body function and structure, activity limitation, participation restriction)</HEADING><P>The secondary objectives were to investigate whether fitness training improves impairments in body function and structure, activity limitation and participation restriction in people who have sustained a TBI. We were unable to determine a clear effect of the intervention on any of the secondary outcomes, primarily because of the lack of data. Within our secondary outcomes, we were able to pool data for only five outcomes (depression, fatigue, strength, body composition and neuromotor function), and we pooled data in a post hoc analysis for depression. No studies included measures of motivation or physical activity. The confidence intervals were wide for the five outcomes that were pooled, and it was uncertain whether fitness training was more or less effective at improving the outcome compared to the control interventions. This highlights the need for adequately powered studies that incorporate measures of body function and structure, activity limitation, and participation restriction to assess satisfactorily the benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness training for people who have sustained a TBI.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes (safety, acceptance, feasibility, suitability)</HEADING><P>The secondary objectives also aimed to evaluate the safety, acceptance, feasibility and suitability of fitness training in people with TBI. No adverse events were reported in the included studies; thus there is no evidence of harm when providing cardiorespiratory fitness training as an intervention for people with TBI. However, participant screening and supervision during training may have influenced this finding. Five of the eight included studies used heart rate monitors and one-to-one supervision during each training session (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2009</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK>), and a sixth study provided one-to-one supervision for one session per week (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2010</LINK>), thus participants were monitored to ensure they were exercising safely and at a suitable exercise intensity. It should also be considered that the finding of no adverse events may be because participants were not specifically questioned regarding this, so minor adverse events such as a muscle strain may have gone unreported. Screening of potential participants for suitability to exercise was also conducted by six of the eight included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK>), which may have avoided adverse events. It should be noted however, that none of the studies reported using a standardised screening checklist such as described by <LINK REF="REF-Vitale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitale 1996</LINK> or the American College of Sports Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2014</LINK>). Use of checklists such as these before commencing fitness testing and training provides rigorous screening to ensure the risk of adverse events is minimised.</P><P>We examined the dropout and adherence rates to determine how acceptable and feasible carrying out a cardiorespiratory fitness programme is for people after TBI. All eight studies reported a low dropout rate, demonstrating that this intervention was considered acceptable to the participants. Adherence was defined as the number of exercise sessions completed compared to the number prescribed. Five of the eight studies reported adherence rates (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK>), these ranged from 69% in <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>, to 100% in <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 2001</LINK>. In these five studies each exercise session was supervised, hence the adherence rates reported should be accurate. The study with the lowest adherence was an inpatient study and poor adherence was primarily because participants were discharged from hospital before the end of the programme, and had difficulty returning for each session. Interestingly, the two studies with 100% adherence and no dropouts comprised participants who were community-dwelling. Cardiorespiratory fitness training prescribed after discharge home thus appears to be both acceptable and feasible.</P><P>We examined the ability to achieve the training parameters to determine how suitable a cardiorespiratory fitness programme is for people after TBI. However, only one study reported the actual training parameters achieved (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>). In this study, participants in the intervention group spent on average 16 minutes per session within or above their training heart rate zone and only exercised for an average 24.5 minutes per session. This study was conducted in people early after TBI (&lt; 6 months) and there was uncertainty regarding the effect of fitness training compared to relaxation therapy on cardiorespiratory fitness (MD 21.5 W, 95% CI -12.3 to 55.3). In comparison, in the fitness programme for the study that showed a clear positive effect, participants who were more than one year postinjury were required to work for 60 minutes within their training heart rate zone. However, because <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK> did not report the actual training intensity and duration achieved, we can only speculate that a longer duration of exercise at sufficient intensity may have contributed to the difference in effect size between these two studies. In an observational study conducted by our team we were able to demonstrate that early after TBI (average time since injury was 3.7 months) people can meet the exercise dosage recommended in the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for people after stroke or TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer_x002d_McLean-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer-McLean 2009</LINK>). However, this could only be achieved by participating in exercise of longer duration and lower intensity (52 minutes) because of the difficulty of sustaining moderate intensity workloads (<LINK REF="STD-Hassett-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hassett 2012</LINK>). This would suggest the importance in clinical situations of monitoring the intensity and duration of exercise to ensure a sufficient dosage of exercise is provided, and highlights the need for future studies to monitor and record actual training data systematically for each of the parameters to enable valid interpretation of results.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-11-23 06:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>None of the included studies investigated the effect of fitness training in children who had sustained a TBI. This is a major gap in the literature when it is considered that one of the goals of children's rehabilitation teams is the successful reintegration of these children into sport and physical activities (<LINK REF="REF-Rossi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 1996</LINK>). It was not possible to perform subgroup analyses due to too few included studies, thus generalisation to the TBI population is difficult. Most participants in the eight included studies were ambulant adult males who had sustained a severe TBI, thus results may not be applicable to other TBI subgroups (e.g. teenage females with a mild TBI). One of our planned subgroup analyses was time since injury. The disparate findings between the <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Driver-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Driver 2004</LINK> studies for cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as the post hoc analysis that included only chronic TBI participants for depression, suggest that time postinjury may be important. Future studies investigating the effects of fitness training in the acute and chronic stage after TBI would enable subgroup analyses to be conducted to determine if fitness training is indeed effective at improving cardiorespiratory fitness, depression and other outcomes early and late after TBI.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-11-23 06:51:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review included only randomised controlled trials, thus each outcome was initially rated as high quality evidence. Applying the GRADE criteria, one outcome was downgraded to moderate-quality evidence (neuromotor function), four to low-quality evidence (cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, depression sensitivity analysis, dropouts), and three were downgraded to very low-quality evidence (fatigue, depression, strength). The evidence was downgraded due to the risk of bias of study design, heterogeneity among studies and imprecision of the estimate of effect. For the primary outcome (cardiorespiratory fitness), the two studies providing most data had different effect sizes. One of the hypothesised reasons for this difference was the difference in time postinjury of the participants. However, the study with the larger effect size did not use allocation concealment, which has been shown to increase the effect size of trials when compared to trials with adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>). This could have contributed to the difference in effect sizes. This reinforces the need for future trials to incorporate design features known to minimise bias.<BR/></P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-12-17 07:51:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Our search strategy was thorough, and incorporated 10 electronic databases, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (the central database for 16 trial registries), a review of reference lists from relevant systematic reviews and any full copy articles obtained, and personal communication with the first authors of included studies. We excluded five studies because we could not confirm their eligibility (<LINK REF="STD-Froehlich_x002d_Grobe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Froehlich-Grobe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herterich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Herterich 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurowski-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Kurowski 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rarick-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Rarick 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2004</LINK>), and we have yet to confirm eligibility for one study (<LINK REF="STD-McClanachan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McClanachan 2013</LINK>), thus we cannot be certain that we have not missed some data. However for four of the studies that were excluded, it was unclear whether any TBI participants were included, and for four of the five studies it was unclear whether the intervention met our criteria for fitness training. As such, we believe that it is likely these studies would have been excluded or contributed few participants to the review. While we did not do any handsearching, the Cochrane Injuries Group undertakes handsearching; thus any further relevant references should have been identified from the Cochrane Injuries Group Trials Register. We therefore feel confident that this review contains all the relevant studies on this topic.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-12-20 12:55:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There have been no other systematic reviews published that have evaluated fitness training in people with TBI, although there are systematic reviews that have evaluated fitness training in a similar population (i.e. people after stroke; <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2016</LINK>) and in populations with similar impairments (e.g. people with depression; <LINK REF="REF-Cooney-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 2013</LINK>). The results of the review for people after stroke were similar to ours; there were small improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness with fitness training at the end of intervention (peak oxygen uptake (VO&#8322; peak) MD 2.86, 95% CI 1.76 to 3.96 mL/kg/min; 9 studies, 425 participants) and mixed findings for other outcomes, such as small improvements in walking speed and endurance and unclear effects on depression (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2016</LINK>). As with our review, the small number of studies, few participants and the variety of outcome measures used limited the conclusions that could be drawn for many of the secondary outcomes. A Cochrane Review that evaluated the effect of exercise on depression in both clinical and non-clinical populations - 33 studies used fitness training - reported a moderate effect of exercise on depression (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.42; 35 studies, 1356 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Cooney-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 2013</LINK>). However, a sensitivity analysis that incorporated only studies at low risk of bias showed a dilution of this effect, so there is still some uncertainty regarding the effect size of fitness training on depression. </P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-20 10:32:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-20 10:32:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In summary, cardiorespiratory fitness training appears to be effective at improving cardiorespiratory fitness in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), however whether this effect is clinically worthwhile is not clear. The certainty of this result is limited due to the small number of relevant studies plus the diversity of interventions and methodological biases in some studies. Nonetheless, fitness training appears to be an acceptable and feasible intervention and there is no evidence of harm for people with TBI. However, its effect on other secondary outcomes (impairments in body function and structure, activity limitation and participation restriction as well as its suitability) is unclear, again due to the small number of studies plus the diversity of interventions, participants and outcomes. The very few studies investigating this intervention make it difficult for clinicians to make an evidence-based decision about the implementation of a fitness training programme for a person with TBI. Although this review has not been able to provide a definitive answer regarding the effects of fitness training in this group, it has provided some evidence to suggest it is an intervention with no documented harms, that is well accepted and feasible to implement. In light of insufficient data, clinicians may be guided by the pre-exercise screening checklists (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vitale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitale 1996</LINK>), and set training parameters using the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for people who have sustained a brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer_x002d_McLean-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer-McLean 2009</LINK>).</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-23 23:58:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The effectiveness of cardiorespiratory fitness training among people with TBI needs to be evaluated with adequately powered, well-designed, randomised controlled studies that incorporate measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (using blood gas analysis, if feasible), as well as measures of body function and structure, activity limitation and participation restriction. In addition, studies should investigate the effectiveness of fitness training in different subgroups of people with TBI (e.g. children and people with different severities of injury) as well as at different times postinjury. To investigate the relative importance and the suitability of implementing each training parameter in accordance with the ACSM guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer_x002d_McLean-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer-McLean 2009</LINK>), experimental interventions ought to be set within these guidelines and then each training parameter monitored and recorded throughout the intervention. Monitoring and questioning for adverse events should also be incorporated into the study design to confirm the safety of cardiorespiratory fitness training.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-12-17 08:28:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Andrew Bateman, Simon Driver, James Laskin, Tom McMillan, Karen Schwab and Lisa Martin on behalf of the Defense and Veteran Head Injury Program study group in the USA, and Jeanne Hoffman, for providing additional or unpublished data from their studies.

The author was unable to provide more detailed information regarding physical exercise intervention, as primary interest of this study was the attention training.<BR/></P></CHAR_NOTES></INCLUDED_CHAR><INCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2017-12-20 14:05:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Salazar-2000"><CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2017-12-20 13:58:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>2 parallel groups, single-centre RCT, block randomisation</P><P>Adequate allocation concealment (randomisation scheme controlled by person independent of the treatment teams and with no interaction with potential participants)<BR/>Complete assessor blinding was not possible.</P><P>7/67 dropouts from Intervention group (during intervention; 2 for medical reasons, 5 voluntarily); 2/53 dropouts from Control group (during intervention; required supplementary therapy)</P></CHAR_METHODS><CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2017-12-20 13:58:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Country: USA</P><P>Mean (SD) age (years): Intervention group: 25 (7); Control group: 26 (6)</P><P>Sex (male:female): Intervention group: 62:5; Control group: 51:2</P><P>Injury severity: 3 mild: 17 moderate: 99 severe: 1 unknown</P><P>Cause of injury: Intervention group: 31 RTAs: 10 falls: 18 acts of violence: 7 sports: 1 other; Control group: 38 RTAs: 9 falls: 4 acts of violence: 1 sports: 1 other</P><P>Mean (SD) time since injury (months): Intervention group: 1 (1); Control group: 1 (1)</P><P>All participants could ambulate independently.</P><P>Inclusion criteria: active-duty military personnel with moderate-to-severe closed head injury (measured by admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of &#8804; 13, or post-traumatic amnesia of &#8805; 24 hours, or focal cerebral contusion or haemorrhage on computed tomography or MRI); head injury within 3 months of randomisation; Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level of 7; active duty military member not pending military separation; accompanied home setting with at least 1 responsible adult available; an ability to ambulate independently; no prior severe TBI or other severe disability that would preclude return to active duty after study treatment; and voluntary informed consent</P></CHAR_PARTICIPANTS><CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-20 13:59:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Both groups participated in an 8-week programme followed by a 6-month return to work trial.</P><P>Intervention group: participated in a hospital-based programme which included attending a 1-hour fitness group 5 days per week for 60 minutes, led by a rehabilitation assistant. The fitness group was designed to prepare the participants for the physical fitness requirements of active duty. An alternative physical activities programme was organised if the participant was not able to participate in this group. The participants were prescribed a cautious return to the rigorous army physical fitness standards. All participants in this group participated in a multidisciplinary inpatient programme with a neurological focus and integrated work-based treatment intervention consisting of group and individual therapies.</P><P>Control group: participated in a home-based programme which included a gradual return to physical activity. They were provided with instructions to exercise for at least 30 minutes twice a week, at their own pace. They were supported in this programme by a weekly 30-minute phone call by a nurse to inquire about the week's events and offering support and advice. The participants in this group were given TBI educational materials, trained in various card game exercises, encouraged to watch the news and read magazines and books, all strategies for enhancing cognitive functioning.</P></CHAR_INTERVENTIONS><CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2017-12-20 14:05:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Assessed at baseline and at follow-up (12 months post treatment).
