<P>
<B>Review question: </B>In spontaneously breathing preterm infants with respiratory failure, does continuous distending pressure (CDP) of the lung reduce the need for assisted ventilation and other associated complications of prematurity?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common cause of disease and death in babies born before 34 weeks' gestation. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) has been the standard way of helping these babies breathe. A simpler method of assisting breathing is to provide continuous distending pressure of the lung, either as continuous positive pressure to the airway or as continuous negative pressure (partial vacuum).</P>
<P>
<B>Search dates: </B>The search was conducted in April 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>Six studies of moderate quality were identified for inclusion.</P>
<P>The source of distending pressure was a negative pressure chamber in two studies, face mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in two studies, nasal CPAP in one study and negative pressure for less severe illness and endotracheal CPAP when more severe in another study. The studies were small, and four of the six were conducted before surfactant therapy was available.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> The review of trials found that outcomes for babies were improved. Fewer required IPPV and fewer died, and with these two outcomes combined, fewer babies died or required IPPV. It was also found that CDP can increase the rate of pneumothorax (air outside the lung within the chest cavity).</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion: </B>Some meaningful benefits were found when continuous distending pressure (CDP) was used for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm babies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-11 03:30:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the single most important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. In infants with progressive respiratory insufficiency, intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with surfactant is the standard treatment for the condition, but it is invasive, potentially resulting in airway and lung injury. Continuous distending pressure (CDP) has been used for the prevention and treatment of RDS, as well as for the prevention of apnoea, and in weaning from IPPV. Its use in the treatment of RDS might reduce the need for IPPV and its sequelae.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-06-24 09:25:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effect of continuous distending pressure (CDP) on the need for IPPV and associated morbidity in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with respiratory distress.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned on the basis of birth weight (&gt; or &lt; 1000 or 1500 g), gestational age (groups divided at about 28 weeks and 32 weeks), methods of application of CDP (i.e. CPAP and CNP), application early versus late in the course of respiratory distress and high versus low pressure CDP and application of CDP in tertiary compared with non-tertiary hospitals, with the need for sensitivity analysis determined by trial quality.</P>
<P>At the 2008 update, the objectives were modified to include preterm infants with respiratory failure.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-11 03:34:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 30 April 2015) and EMBASE (1980 to 30 April 2015) with no language restriction, as well as controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>

<P>All random or quasi-random trials of preterm infants with respiratory distress were eligible. Interventions were continuous distending pressure including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by mask, nasal prong, nasopharyngeal tube or endotracheal tube, or continuous negative pressure (CNP) via a chamber enclosing the thorax and the lower body, compared with spontaneous breathing with oxygen added as necessary.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 03:34:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group, including independent assessment of trial quality and extraction of data by each review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-12 04:38:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six studies involving 355 infants - two using face mask CPAP, two CNP, one nasal CPAP and one both CNP (for less ill babies) and endotracheal CPAP (for sicker babies). For this update, we included no new trials.</P>
<P>Continuous distending pressure (CDP) is associated with lower risk of treatment failure (death or use of assisted ventilation) (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.81; typical risk difference (RD) -0.20, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5, 95% CI 4 to 10; six studies; 355 infants), lower overall mortality (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; typical RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.04; NNTB 7, 95% CI 4 to 25; six studies; 355 infants) and lower mortality in infants with birth weight above 1500 g (typical RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84; typical RD -0.28, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.08; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2.00 to 13.00; two studies; 60 infants). Use of CDP is associated with increased risk of pneumothorax (typical RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.39 to 5.04; typical RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 17, 95% CI 17.00 to 25.00; six studies; 355 infants). We found no difference in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days (three studies, 260 infants), as well as no difference in outcome at nine to 14 years (one study, 37 infants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-29 22:15:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline J Ho">
<P>In preterm infants with respiratory distress, the application of CDP as CPAP or CNP is associated with reduced respiratory failure and mortality and an increased rate of pneumothorax. Four out of six of these trials were done in the 1970s. Therefore, the applicability of these results to current practice is difficult to assess. Further research is required to determine the best mode of administration.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-29 22:16:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline J Ho">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-29 22:16:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline J Ho">
<P>Respiratory failure due to pulmonary disease, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 2004</LINK>). Most causes of respiratory distress present in a similar manner, sometimes making precise diagnosis difficult. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with surfactant treatment is the standard treatment for the condition. The major difficulty with IPPV is that it is invasive and contributes to airway and lung injury, including the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Surfactant has brought some amelioration to this problem (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-11 03:50:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapy for respiratory distress traditionally consisted of oxygen given via headbox, low-flow nasal prong or cannula or face mask. Infants with severe disease received IPPV. Continuous distending pressure (CDP) has been used for the prevention and treatment of RDS, as well as for the prevention of apnoea, and in weaning from IPPV. Its use in the treatment of RDS might reduce the need for IPPV and hence its sequelae. Cost saving could occur if more expensive forms of treatment such as IPPV and use of surfactant were avoided.</P>
<P>CDP has been applied as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or as continuous negative pressure (CNP). CPAP is applied via face mask, nasal mask, nasopharyngeal tube or nasal prongs, using a conventional ventilator, bubble circuit or CPAP driver. CNP is applied externally to the thorax using a negative pressure chamber with the seal around the neck; it produces lung distension as a result of negative intrathoracic pressure.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-11 03:52:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Application of positive compared with negative pressure might have different results in terms of effectiveness and complications. As use of CDP depends on the spontaneous respiratory efforts of the infant, those of very low birth weight, who would be expected to have reduced efforts and be more prone to apnoea, might not respond as well.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-12 04:25:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several systematic reviews have examined the effects of CDP, particularly when given as CPAP. <LINK REF="REF-Subramaniam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramaniam 2005</LINK> looked at prophylactic CPAP applied to preterm infants immediately after birth, <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2004</LINK> studied the effects of CPAP on infants immediately after extubation from IPPV and the <LINK REF="REF-De-Paoli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Paoli 2008</LINK> review looked at devices and pressure sources for applying CPAP. <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2004</LINK> examined the timing of initiation of CDP in preterm infants with respiratory distress.</P>
<P>A formal evaluation of the use of CDP is required to assess its role in preterm infants with established respiratory distress and to determine which methods of application are appropriate.</P>
<P>A systematic review on this subject has already been published (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1992</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-12 02:52:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found that CDP compared with supportive care reduces treatment failure, whether it is defined by the combined outcome of mortality with the need for IPPV, deterioration of blood gas parameters or need for admission to a NICU. Simillar reductions in treatment failure were seen in subgroup analyses of trials using CPAP and CNP. We found that CDP reduces mortality as well as the need for additional ventilatory support. An increase was found in any pneumothorax and pneumothorax appearing after the start of the intervention. Data on other adverse events such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia and necrotising enterocolitis are insufficient. Data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes are also insufficient. Data that are available suggest that CDP does not have an adverse effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-12 04:39:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For several reasons, the results of this review, which included trials carried out in the 1970s, have limited application to current neonatal care. In the 1970s, antenatal corticosteroid use was uncommon and surfactant treatment was not available. The mean birth weight of participants in the studies reviewed was between 1700 and 2000 g, with three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belenky-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Belenky 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durbin-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Durbin 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanaroff-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Fanaroff 1973</LINK>) excluding infants weighing less than 1000 g. CPAP was applied by face mask in two of the three trials of CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Belenky-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Belenky 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1973</LINK>), and this route has been reported to be associated with adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Pape-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pape 1976</LINK>). Currently, the nasal route is the standard way of delivering CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2004</LINK>), and differences in efficacy have been shown between devices delivering nasal CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-De-Paoli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Paoli 2008</LINK>). The intervention in early trials was initiated later than would be current practice (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Narendran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narendran 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tooley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tooley 2003</LINK>), with mean age at entry greater than 10 hours in four studies and 28 hours in the fifth. <LINK REF="STD-Buckmaster-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Buckmaster 2007</LINK> initiated CPAP at a mean of three hours. Earlier CPAP is more effective in preventing intubation for IPPV than later CPAP in infants with RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2004</LINK>). Five of the six trials provided outcomes only up to discharge from the neonatal unit. Only one study provided information on outcomes in childhood, so data on adverse neurological outcomes are extremely limited.</P>
<P>This review is historically important because it establishes the role of CDP in preterm infants with respiratory distress. In addition, the results are currently relevant in settings where access to intensive care is not immediately available, such as in Level 2 hospitals or in low and middle income settings where intensive care is limited. However, conditions today in low and middle income countries have certain dissimilarities to those of the studies from the 1970s included in this review. Today's settings have some availability, even if limited, of antenatal steroids, surfactant and ventilators. CDP is an inexpensive therapy; therefore randomised trials in developing countries where resources are scarce seem appropriate. However, the reduced mortality seen in our meta-analysis makes randomisation to headbox oxygen or other forms of oxygen therapy (compared with CDP) difficult. This problem is well illustrated by the trial of Pieper et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pieper-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pieper 2003</LINK>). Loss of equipoise by the clinical staff at participating South African centres led to cessation of randomisation and allocation of infants to CPAP on the basis of availability of this form of care.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-01 10:46:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline J Ho">
<P>These data should be interpreted with caution as in the studies reviewed, the numbers of infants were small, blinding of treatment was not possible and blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in only one study for the outcomes in childhood, thus possibly introducing bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-12 03:05:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found moderate heterogeneity for our primary outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 46%). However, the results did not change substantially and remained significant with random-effects meta-analysis. Inclusion of the subgroup of spontaneously breathing infants from the <LINK REF="STD-Belenky-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Belenky 1976</LINK> trial could be criticised, as group allocation to CDP or control was not stratified by this characteristic, and this could lead to imbalance. That imbalance is present is suggested by the greater birth weight of the group allocated to CPAP. Removal of this trial as part of a sensitivity analysis did not substantially alter the results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-12 03:07:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In preterm infants with respiratory distress, the application of CDP as CPAP or CNP is associated with reduced respiratory failure and reduced mortality. CDP is associated with an increased rate of pneumothorax. The applicability of these results to current practice is difficult to assess, given the intensive care setting of the 1970s in which four of these trials were done. The contribution of the two studies done in the post-surfactant era does not alter the overall results. The only study with reported outcomes in childhood suggests no long-term adverse effects of CDP on neurodevelopment. CPAP has a role in nurseries where intensive care is not immediately available, which may include settings such as low income countries with no access to intensive care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-12 03:09:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials of CDP (preferably using low cost nasal CPAP) compared with supportive care for preterm infants with RDS could be carried out in low income countries to assess relative benefits and harms in such settings. Such studies should ideally include follow-up into childhood. The comparison group should be representative of supportive care available in the setting, such as oxygen delivered by headbox, low flow nasal cannula or other delivery of oxygen that does not generate pressure. In other settings, further studies are required to evaluate the use of early nasal CPAP with or without prior temporary tracheal intubation for surfactant administration (<LINK REF="REF-Verder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verder 1999</LINK>). More studies are required to determine the optimum level (pressure) and mode of delivery of CPAP.</P>
