<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-23 13:37:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines that frequently occurs in the lower part of the small intestine, called the ileum. However, Crohn&#8217;s disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea. Prevention of clinical relapse (resumption of symptoms of active disease) in patients in remission is an important objective in the management of Crohn&#8217;s disease. Methotrexate is a drug that suppresses the body's natural immune responses and may suppress inflammation associated with Crohn&#8217;s disease. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness and side effects of methotrexate used to maintain remission in Crohn's patients. </P>
<P>This review identified five studies that included a total of 333 participants. Two studies compared methotrexate (administered by pill or intramuscular injection) to a placebo (a sugar pill or a saline injection). One of these two studies also compared methotrexate to 6-mercaptopurine (an immunosuppressive drug). One small study compared methotrexate to both 6-mercaptopurine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (an anti-inflammatory drug). Two studies compared combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug that is a tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonist) to infliximab used by itself. One high quality study (76 patients) shows that methotrexate (15 mg/week) injected intramuscularly (i.e. into muscles located in the arm or thigh) for 40 weeks is superior to placebo for preventing relapse (return of disease symptoms) among patients whose disease became inactive while taking higher doses of intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week). Side effects occurred in a small number of patients. These side effects are usually mild in nature and include nausea and vomiting, cold symptoms, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain and fatigue. One small study (22 patients) found no difference in continued remission between low dose methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) taken orally and placebo and suggests that low dose oral methotrexate is not an effective treatment for inactive Crohn's disease. However this result is uncertain due to the small number of patients assessed in the study. Large-scale studies of methotrexate given orally at higher doses for maintenance of remission in Crohn&#8217;s disease may provide stronger evidence for the use of methotrexate in this manner. A pooled analysis of two studies (50 patients) found no difference in continued remission between oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) and 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/kg/day). No firm conclusions can be drawn as these results are uncertain due to poor study quality and small numbers of patients. A small study (13 patients) found no difference in continued remission between methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid. No conclusions can be drawn from this study as the results are very uncertain due to poor study quality and small numbers of patients. A pooled analysis of two studies (145 patients) found no difference in continued remission between combination therapy and infliximab. Combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab does not appear to be any more effective for maintenance of remission than infliximab used by itself. This result is uncertain because one study was of poor quality (the other was high quality) and small numbers of patients. </P>

<P>Safe and effective long-term treatments that reduce the need for corticosteroids are needed for Crohn's disease. Although purine antimetabolites are moderately effective for maintenance of remission patients often relapse despite treatment with these agents. Methotrexate may provide a safe and effective alternative to more expensive maintenance treatment with TNF-&#945; antagonists. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.</P>

<P>Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients maintaining clinical remission as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention-to-treat analysis).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-23 13:53:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Five studies (n = 333 patients) were included in the review. Three studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to blinding. Intramuscular methotrexate was superior to placebo for maintenance of remission at 40 weeks follow-up. Sixty-five per cent of patients in the intramuscular methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 39% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 76 patients).The number needed to treat to prevent one relapse was four. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (40 events). There was no statistically significant difference in maintenance of remission at 36 weeks follow-up between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) and placebo. Ninety per cent of patients in the oral methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 67% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 22 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (17 events). A pooled analysis of two small studies (n = 50) showed no statistically significant difference in continued remission between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg to 15 mg/week) and 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/kg/day) for maintenance of remission. Seventy-seven per cent of methotrexate patients maintained remission compared to 57% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.00). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of bias in one study (no blinding) and very sparse data (33 events). One small (13 patients) poor quality study found no difference in continued remission between methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid (RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 29.79). A pooled analysis of two studies (n = 145) including one high quality trial (n = 126) found no statistically significant difference in maintenance of remission at 36 to 48 weeks between combination therapy (methotrexate and infliximab) and infliximab monotherapy. Fifty-four percent of patients in the combination therapy group maintained remission compared to 53% of monotherapy patients (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.38, P = 0.95). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to high risk of bias in one study (no blinding) and sparse data (78 events). Adverse events were generally mild in nature and resolved upon discontinuation or with folic acid supplementation. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, symptoms of a cold, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain or arthralgia, and fatigue.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-23 13:58:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Moderate quality evidence indicates that intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/week is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Intramuscular methotrexate appears to be safe. Low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) does not appear to be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Combination therapy (methotrexate and infliximab) does not appear to be any more effective for maintenance of remission than infliximab monotherapy. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Large-scale studies of methotrexate given orally at higher doses for maintenance of remission in Crohn&#8217;s disease may provide stronger evidence for the use of methotrexate in this manner.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-23 13:58:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease is a condition of transmural intestinal inflammation that is often discontinuous and can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a chronic illness characterized by periods of remission and recurrences. Goals of management include control of acute exacerbation, induction of remission, and maintenance of remission.</P>
<P>Many patients require long-term maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Corticosteroids are not effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhart 2003</LINK>). Patients with steroid-dependent or refractory disease require immunosuppressive agents to maintain disease remission. Although azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are modestly effective for maintenance of remission, they can have significant toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Chebli-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chebli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prefontaine-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prefontaine 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infliximab, a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody against tumor-necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for maintenance of clinical remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2002</LINK>). It is administered intravenously and maintenance therapy usually requires regular repeat dosing (every 8 weeks). Although the safety profile of infliximab is considered to be favorable over the short-term, the data on long-term toxicity are still preliminary. In addition, the formation of antibodies to infliximab may lead to infusion reactions and reduced efficacy over time (<LINK REF="REF-Baert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baert 2003</LINK>). Infliximab is generally reserved for Crohn's disease patients who have had an inadequate response to standard therapies. This is due to the cost of drug acquisition, inconvenient intravenous dosing, and immunogenicity. Thus, other alternatives to infliximab may need to be considered for maintenance therapy.</P>
<P>Methotrexate, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rampton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampton 2001</LINK>). Methotrexate has also been studied for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK>).

<P>A computer assisted search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register and the on-line databases MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant publications from inception to 9 June 2014. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer assisted search strategy. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies. The search strategies are reported in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>
<B>Study selection: </B>The above search strategy was used to select potentially relevant trials (papers or abstracts). Two authors (YW and JKM) independently reviewed the selected trials and determined eligibility for inclusion based on the above criteria. Studies published in abstract form were only included if the authors could be contacted for further information.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction:</B> Two authors (YW and JKM) independently extracted data. The outcome data of interest were the number of patients randomized into each treatment group and the number of patients in each group who failed to maintain remission. The numbers lost to follow-up and the duration of follow-up were also recorded. Treatment and control modalities were summarized, as were the demographics of the study population. Any disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Two authors (YW and JKM) independently assessed the risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Factors assessed included:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sequence generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?);</LI>
<LI>allocation sequence concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?);</LI>
<LI>blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?);</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?);</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?); and </LI>
<LI>other potential sources of bias (i.e. was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?).</LI>
</OL>
<P>A judgement of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Study authors were contacted when insufficient information was provided to determine risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE criteria to assess the overall quality of evidence used for specific outcomes in this review. Evidence from randomized controlled trials begin as high quality evidence. They can then be downgraded due to: (1) risk of bias from the studies, (2) indirect evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision in data, and (5) publication bias. The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was determined and classified as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate<I> </I>quality<I> </I>(i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); or very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.3). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, and treated dichotomously. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients maintaining clinical remission as defined by the studies. Data were combined for analysis where appropriate. If a comparison was only assessed in a single trial, P-values were derived using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. If the comparison was assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived by calculating the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using a fixed-effect model. The presence of heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (a P value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant) and the I<SUP>2</SUP>statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2000</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the role of methotrexate for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Patients were given either methotrexate 15 mg/week intramuscularly (n = 40) or identical placebo (n = 36) for a total of 40 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse at 40 weeks; secondary outcomes included the need for prednisone and adverse drug reactions. The patients were assessed every 4 weeks for a total of 40 weeks. The study medication was discontinued if a patient required treatment for active Crohn's disease. However, of the 36 patients that relapsed in the study, 22 were given methotrexate 25 mg intramuscularly once weekly, in addition to prednisone for treatment of the exacerbation. The intention-to-treat principle was used to analyze the results.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the role of methotrexate when used in combination with infliximab for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Eligible patients needed to have a diagnosis of CD and initiated prednisone for active symptoms within the last six weeks. Patients were given either weekly subcutaneous injections of methotrexate (n = 63) or identical placebo (n = 63) for a total of 50 weeks. In addition, all patients (N = 126) received infliximab 5mg/kg intravenously at weeks 1, 3, 7, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure, defined as failure to enter prednisone-free remission (CDAI &lt; 150) at week 14 or failure to maintain remission through week 50. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who achieved overall treatment success, the proportion of patients who achieved prednisone-free remission at week 14, the mean change in the CDAI and SF-36 scores, the median change in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, the median serum infliximab concentration, the proportion of patients who developed antibodies to infliximab, and the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events. Tapering of prednisone began at week 1 and all patients were required to discontinue prednisone by week 14. Aminosalicylates, budesonide, probiotics, systemic antibiotics for the treatment of luminal CD, immunosuppressives, investigational agents, parenteral nutrition, or topical aminosalicylates or corticosteroids were not permitted. Antibiotics were allowed for non-CD indications and active perianal disease for a maximum of 14 consecutive days.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> conducted a randomized, unblinded, single-centre trial comparing 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and 5-aminosalicylic acid for the treatment of steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the above medications' efficacy for inducing and maintaining remission in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The trial duration was 106 weeks and the study was divided into two parts - induction of remission for 30 weeks and maintenance of remission for 76 weeks. Seventy-two patients were enrolled, including 34 patients with ulcerative colitis and 38 with Crohn's disease. None of the patients had received 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate prior to entering the study. Steroid-dependency was defined as the inability to reduce the dose of prednisone to 20 mg per day without presenting with inflammatory activity (determined by a CDAI &#8805; 200 or &#8805; 2 episodes in the last 6 months or &#8805; 3 episodes within the last 12 months). During the induction phase patients were assigned to receive oral treatment with 6-mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg/day (n = 15), methotrexate 15 mg/week (n = 15), or 5-aminosalicylic acid 3 g/day (n = 7). There was no placebo comparator. All patients were initially on an individually adjusted dose of prednisone (maximum dose 1 mg/kg/day). At the first patient assessment (week 2), the daily dose of prednisone was decreased by 8 mg/week if the patient's condition was deemed stable or improved. Prednisone was discontinued if clinical remission was achieved. After 30 weeks of induction treatment patients who entered remission were entered into a maintenance phase and were followed every 6 weeks for a total of 76 weeks. Crohn's patients who entered the maintenance phase included 12 methotrexate patients, 15 6-mercaptopurine patients and 1 5-aminosalicylic acid patient. Once clinical remission was achieved, the MTX dose was reduced to 10 mg/week, the 6-MP dose was reduced to 1 mg/kg/day, and the 5-ASA dose remained the same. Outcome measures included a CDAI every 24 weeks (weeks 54 and 78) and at the end of the maintenance of remission study (week 106), and elapse.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled study comparing methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, and placebo for the treatment of chronic, active Crohn's disease. Patients aged 17 to 75 years with chronic, active Crohn's disease who had been diagnosed for at least one year were included. Eighty-four patients received either oral methotrexate at a dose of 12.5 mg per week (n = 26) or 6-mercaptopurine 50 mg/day (n = 32) or placebo (n=26). 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations were being used by 18 patients (72%) in the methotrexate group, 21 patients (63%) in the 6-mercaptopurine group, and 18 patients (69%) in the placebo group. At entry steroids were being used by 20 patients (80%) in the methotrexate group, 26 patients (79%) in the 6-mercaptopurine group, and 19 patients (73%) in the placebo group. Patients were assessed at weeks two, six and eight after randomization, and then every four weeks for nine months. The outcome measures were the proportion of patients entering first remission, the time to first remission, the proportion of patients maintaining remission up to nine month follow-up, decrease in steroid requirements, quality of life as measured by the 'Treatment Goal Score' and adverse events. The Harvey-Bradshaw index and the 'Treatment Goal Score' were assessed for each patient during each study visit to monitor response to therapy. Steroids were tapered at the direction of the treating physician with the goal of discontinuation within the first two to three months of the trial. Steroids could also be reintroduced or doses increased if deemed necessary.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK> conducted a randomized, open-label, pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab for treating patients with refractory Crohn's disease. To be eligible for the study, patients needed to be naive to TNF-&#945; antagonists at entry. Patients receiving stable doses 5-aminosalicylates (&gt; 4 g/day) or prednisone (&lt; 40 mg/day) or both were also eligible for the study. All patients received infliximab at weeks 0 and 2; and those in methotrexate group received a 20 mg infusion per week at weeks 0 to 5, and then a weekly oral dose for 48 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical remission at the end of the trial (CDAI &lt; 150). The secondary outcomes included time to achieve clinical remission and the corticosteroid-tapering effect of treatment. Safety of the combination treatment was assessed using adverse events, clinical signs, and laboratory parameters at each visit.</P>

<BR/>After 40 weeks of treatment, relapse occurred in 14 of 40 (35%) patients assigned methotrexate and 22 of 36 (61%) patients given placebo (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; P=0.02). The NNT (number needed to treat) to prevent one relapse was 4. The mean time to relapse with methotrexate was &gt; 40 weeks, and with placebo it was 22 weeks. Of the 36 patients who relapsed, 22 were subsequently treated with intramuscular methotrexate 25 mg weekly. Twelve (55%) of these patients again were in remission at week 40 compared to 2 of 14 patients (14%) who were not treated with methotrexate after relapse. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, symptoms of a cold, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain or arthralgia, and fatigue. None of the patients in the methotrexate group had a serious adverse event compared to two in the placebo group (cervical dysplasia and viral respiratory tract infection.

<BR/>With regard to the primary outcome, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups. At week 50, the actuarial rate of treatment failure was 30.6% in the combination therapy group compared with 29.8% in the infliximab monotherapy group (P=0.63, 95% CI, 0.63-2.17). The lack of difference was confirmed using a multiple Cox regression model with adjustments for CRP, CDAI, prednisone dose, and time since diagnosis at baseline (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.67). In terms of secondary outcomes, no clinically meaningful differences were observed. At week 14, 76% of patients treated with the combination of infliximab and methotrexate achieved prednisone-free remission compared with 78% of patients who received infliximab alone (P = 0.83). At week 50, thirty-five of 63 patients (56%) in the combination treatment group maintained remission, compared to 36 of 63 patients (57%) in the infliximab alone group (P = 0.86).</P>

These differences were not statistically significant. Nine patients receiving methotrexate (90%, 95% CI 57% to &gt;99.9%) maintained remission after induction compared to 8 patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine (62%, 95% CI 35% to 82%) and 8 patients receiving placebo (67%, 95% CI 39% to 86%). There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups. The time to first remission and to first relapse data were similar in all groups (data not available).

Clinical remission was observed in 45% of combination therapy patients compared to 25% of infliximab monotherapy patients (P = 0.63). In addition, combination therapy led to earlier remission (median time to remission: 2 weeks in combination group versus 18 weeks in monotherapy group, P = 0.08) and less steroid dependence compared to monotherapy (complete corticosteroid tapering at week 48: 7/7 in combination group versus 2/6 in monotherapy group, P = 0.02).

<P>Methotrexate versus placebo<BR/>Intramuscular methotrexate was superior to placebo for maintenance of remission at 40 weeks follow-up. Sixty-five per cent of patients in the intramuscular methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 39% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 1 study, 76 patients, See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The number needed to treat to prevent one relapse was four. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (40 events). There was no statistically significant difference in maintenance of remission at 36 weeks follow-up between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) and placebo. Ninety per cent of patients in the oral methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 67% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 1 study, 22 patients, See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-23 13:50:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn&#8217;s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gut that is characterized by periods of remission and exacerbations. Once remission is induced, patients often require long-term maintenance therapy in order to prevent relapse and avoid chronic corticosteroid use. This generally requires the use of immunosuppressive agents (as steroid sparing agents). </P>
<P>Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive, is an effective drug for the treatment of active Crohn&#8217;s disease (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2014</LINK>). Accordingly, current practice guidelines recommend the use of methotrexate for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Five randomized, controlled studies that investigated the efficacy of methotrexate for maintenance of remission of Crohn&#8217;s disease were identified for this review. The five studies differed significantly with respect to methodology. Two studies investigated the efficacy of methotrexate compared to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2000</LINK> was a well-designed trial that establishes methotrexate as an effective and safe drug for maintenance therapy in Crohn&#8217;s disease. This study had the largest number of patients and used intramuscular injections of methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg weekly. The trial showed that in Crohn&#8217;s patients who had been induced into remission with methotrexate, significantly more patients remained in remission while taking methotrexate compared to placebo. The other study, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>, also compared methotrexate to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> used oral methotrexate at a lower dose (12.5 mg weekly) and showed no difference between patients treated with methotrexate or placebo. The lower dose of methotrexate, oral route of administration, and small patient population may have been factors contributing to the lack of benefit seen with methotrexate. </P>
<P>Two studies compared methotrexate to 6-mercaptopurine. <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> was a randomized, controlled trial that used oral methotrexate 10 mg weekly in patients that had achieved remission on a higher dose (15 mg orally weekly).  When compared to patients treated with 6-mercaptopurine, there was no statistically significant difference with respect to maintenance of remission. <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> also did not show a statistically significant difference in continued remission between the methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine groups. Although methotrexate was superior to 6-mercaptopurine in a pooled analysis of both studies, the difference was not statistically significant. A GRADE analysis indicates that the evidence supporting this outcome is of very low quality due to sparse data (57 events) and high risk of bias (due to blinding) in the <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> study. Both of these studies used a low dose of oral methotrexate and enrolled small numbers of patients. Neither of these studies used a power calculation to determine how many patients needed to be enrolled to be able to detect clinically important differences between study groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> also compared oral methotrexate to 5-aminosalicylic acid. Thirteen patients were included in this analysis and no conclusions can be drawn from these results.</P>
<P>Two clinical trials studied the effects of methotrexate in combination with infliximab on maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK> was a well-designed adequately powered trial, however, it did not find any significant clinical benefits for combination therapy relative to infliximab monotherapy. A pooled analysis of both studies suggests that there is no difference in continued remission between combination therapy and infliximab monotherapy groups. A GRADE analysis indicates that the evidence supporting this outcome is of low quality due to sparse data (78 events) and high risk of bias (due to blinding) in the <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK> study.</P>
<P>Only one study examined the effect of methotrexate on quality of life. In <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>, an analysis of the 'Treatment Goal Score' revealed that patients treated with methotrexate did better than the other groups with respect to general well-being and abdominal pain. Although these results need to be interpreted cautiously, the trend towards improvement in quality of life parameters is encouraging.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2000</LINK>, there were no severe adverse events reported in the methotrexate group. <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> had three patients withdraw due to adverse events associated with methotrexate use. All symptoms resolved and laboratory values normalized after the medications were discontinued. Folic acid supplementation was used in the methotrexate group to treat mild side effects. There were also no statistically significant differences in withdrawals and adverse events between the treatment groups in <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>. The three studies suggest that methotrexate is safe and well tolerated with most minor adverse drug events being managed by folic acid supplementation.</P>
<P>One well-designed trial provides evidence that methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg intramuscularly weekly is safe and effective for maintenance of remission in quiescent Crohn&#8217;s disease (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2000</LINK>). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate suggesting that further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effects. The <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> studies suggest that lower dose oral methotrexate is safe, but failed to show a benefit.</P>

<P>Moderate quality evidence indicates that intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/week is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Intramuscular methotrexate appears to be safe. Intramuscular and subcutaneous routes have similar pharmacokinetics; however, self-injecting via a subcutaneous route may be easier and better tolerated by patients (<LINK REF="REF-Balis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egan-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arthur-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthur 2002</LINK>). Accordingly, methotrexate is usually administered subcutaneously in practice. Low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) does not appear to be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Combination therapy (methotrexate and infliximab) does not appear to be any more effective for maintenance of remission than infliximab monotherapy. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-23 13:49:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Large-scale studies of methotrexate given orally at higher doses for maintenance of remission in Crohn&#8217;s disease may provide stronger evidence for the use of methotrexate in this manner. In addition, studies investigating absorption of methotrexate in the gastrointestinal tract may help determine which patients can be treated orally.</P>
