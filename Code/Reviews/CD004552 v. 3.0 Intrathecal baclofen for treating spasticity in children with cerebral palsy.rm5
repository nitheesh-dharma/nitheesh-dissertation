<TITLE>Intrathecal baclofen for treating spasticity in children with cerebral palsy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-27 01:20:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Spasticity, which is an increase in muscle tone, is the most common difficulty with movement seen in children with cerebral palsy. Baclofen is a medication which acts on receptors in the brain and spinal cord to reduce abnormal muscle tone. It has been used as an oral medication for many years. The disadvantages of oral administration are that only a small amount of the medication crosses the blood-brain barrier before it can exert an effect, and that the dose is limited by the unwanted effect of excessive sedation. The administration of baclofen into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord overcomes these problems. This treatment is called intrathecal baclofen therapy and it is administered via a pump placed under the skin connected to a catheter which enters the membranes covering the spinal cord to deliver the baclofen directly into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord and brain.</P>
<P>This review concludes that there is a small amount of evidence from studies performed to date that intrathecal baclofen is an effective treatment for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy in the short-term. The effect of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity in children with cerebral palsy over the long term is less clear.</P>
<P>Two short-term studies (by the same investigators) demonstrate a reduction in spasticity, but a single, longer term study shows minimal evidence for reduced spasticity with the use of intrathecal baclofen. Two further short-term studies showed reduction in spasticity with the use of intrathecal baclofen, but the authors used inappropriate methods of analysing the data, so it is uncertain whether these results are valid. All these studies had a small number of participants, making the findings less reliable.</P>
<P>The research also provides evidence from one short term study and one longer term study (again, by the same investigators), that intrathecal baclofen therapy improves the comfort, ease of care and some aspects of quality of life for children with cerebral palsy. However, the results of the longer term study may have been influenced by both the participants and the investigators being aware of whether they were receiving treatment or allocated to the control group. This same study found that intrathecal baclofen improves gross motor function a little in children with cerebral palsy, but again, these results may have been influenced by the way the study was conducted.</P>
<P>Further evidence of the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen for treating spasticity is needed from other investigators in order to validate these results.</P>
<P>There is little evidence from the short-term randomised controlled trials about the safety and economic implications of this treatment when long-term therapy is administered through an implanted device. For the same reasons, we could not reach a conclusion on whether the subsequent need for orthopaedic surgery is altered in children receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-27 04:03:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement and posture arising from a non-progressive lesion in the developing brain. Spasticity, a disorder of increased muscle tone, is the most common motor difficulty and is associated with activity limitation to varying degrees in mobility and self care.</P>
<P>Oral baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, has been used in oral form to treat spasticity for some time, but it has a variable effect on spasticity and the dose is limited by the unwanted effect of excessive sedation. Intrathecal baclofen produces higher local concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid at a fraction of the equivalent oral dose and avoids this excessive sedation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether intrathecal baclofen is an effective treatment for spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-10 16:56:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-08 05:09:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies which compared the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on spasticity, gross motor function or other areas of function with controls.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 04:32:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six studies met the inclusion criteria. The data obtained were unsuitable for the conduct of a meta-analysis; we have completed a qualitative summary.</P>
<P>All studies were found to have high or unclear risk of bias in some aspects of their methodology.</P>
<P>Five of the six studies reported data collected in the randomised controlled phase of the study. A sixth study did not report sufficient results to determine the effect of intrathecal baclofen versus placebo. Of these five studies, four were conducted using lumbar puncture or other short-term means of delivering intrathecal baclofen. One study assessed the effectiveness of implantable intrathecal baclofen pumps over six months.</P>
<P>The four short-term studies demonstrated that intrathecal baclofen therapy reduces spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. However, two of these studies utilised inappropriate techniques for statistical analysis of results. The single longer-term study demonstrated minimal reduction in spasticity with the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy.</P>
<P>One of the short-term studies and the longer term study showed improvement in comfort and ease of care. The longer term study found a small improvement in gross motor function and also in some domains of health-related quality of life. </P>
<P>Some caution is required in interpreting the findings of the all the studies in the review due to methodological issues. In particular, there was a high risk of bias in the methodology of the longer term study due to the lack of placebo use in the control group and the absence of blinding to the intervention after randomisation for both participants and investigators.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 01:20:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some limited short-term evidence that intrathecal baclofen is an effective therapy for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. The effect of intrathecal baclofen on long-term spasticity outcomes is less certain.</P>
<P>The validity of the evidence for the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in treating spasticity in children with cerebral palsy from the studies in the review is constrained by the small sample sizes of the studies and methodological issues in some studies.</P>
<P>Spasticity is a impairment in the domain of body structure and function. Consideration must also be given to the broader context in determining whether intrathecal baclofen therapy is effective. The aim of therapy may be, for example, to improve gross motor function, to increase participation at a social role level, to improve comfort, to improve the ease of care by others or to improve the overall quality of life of the individual. Intrathecal baclofen may improve gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy, but more reliable evidence is needed to determine this.There is some evidence that intrathecal baclofen improves ease of care and the comfort and quality of life of the individuals receiving it, but again small sample sizes and methodological issues in the studies mean that these results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Further evidence of the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen for treating spasticity, increasing gross motor function and improving comfort, ease of care and quality of life is needed from other investigators in order to validate these results.</P>
<P>The short duration of the controlled studies included in this review did not allow for the exploration of questions regarding whether the subsequent need for orthopaedic surgery in children receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy is altered, or the safety and the economic implications of intrathecal baclofen treatment when long-term therapy is administered via an implanted device. Controlled studies are not the most appropriate study design to address these questions, cohort studies may be more appropriate.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-26 06:43:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cerebral palsy is a term which describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation. They are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 2007</LINK>). It has an incidence of approximately two per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Himmelmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Himmelmann 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oskoui-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oskoui 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1984</LINK>). Approximately 80-90% of individuals with cerebral palsy manifest spasticity as the predominant motor disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2011a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Spasticity is generally defined as a form of hypertonia (increased muscle tone) where there is velocity-dependent resistance of muscle to passive stretch due to a heightened stretch reflex (Lance 1980, as cited in <LINK REF="REF-Dietz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheean-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheean 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spasticity is an impairment at the body structure and function level of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). It can lead to activity limitation or participation restriction due to impairment of motor function and positioning to varying degrees, particularly in the functional domains of mobility and self-care. The comfort of the child and ease with which others are able to care for the child may also be negatively affected by spasticity. Spasticity also has role in producing the musculoskeletal problems seen in individuals with cerebral palsy, such as muscle/tendon contractures, bony torsions and hip dysplasia.</P>
<P>A range of methods are currently used to treat spasticity, including physiotherapy, casting and splinting, orthopaedic and neurosurgery, botulinum toxin injections and oral medications. Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, acts selectively on GABA-B receptors in the brain and layers II and III of the dorsal grey matter of the spinal cord (<LINK REF="REF-Davidoff-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidoff 1985</LINK>) to produce an inhibitory effect on presynaptic transmitter release via the restriction of calcium influx into presynaptic terminals, as well as an effect at postsynaptic terminals to decrease neuronal activity by increasing potassium conductance (<LINK REF="REF-Zieglgansberger-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zieglgansberger 1988</LINK>). The oral form of this drug has been in clinical usage for the past four decades, and has a variable degree of effect in reducing spasticity, but often at the cost of producing untoward side effects such as sedation, related to its relative inability to cross the blood brain barrier and the need for high dose levels to achieve substantial clinical effect (<LINK REF="REF-Knuttson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knuttson 1974</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of intrathecal baclofen was first described in 1984 in the treatment of adults with spasticity from spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="REF-Penn-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1984</LINK>). Intrathecal baclofen is delivered via a drug delivery system consisting of a subcutaneously-placed pump containing a drug reservoir, connected to a catheter running posteriorly into the subarachnoid space, to produce much higher local concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid at a fraction of the equivalent oral dose. Early studies highlighted the ability of intrathecal baclofen to reduce tone and other signs of spasticity in adult recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Hugenholtz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugenholtz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loubser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loubser 1991</LINK>). Over the past 20 years there has been an increasing use of this therapy in children with spasticity. This review summarises the evidence for the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in children with spastic cerebral palsy.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-05-26 11:09:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome measures sought were measures of spasticity and gross motor function. The Ashworth scale and the modified Ashworth scale categorise the degree of increase in muscle tone during examination of the affected limb on a five-point scale. They are commonly-used measures of spasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohannon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannon 1987</LINK>). Measures of gross motor function include, for example, the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1989</LINK>), a validated assessment tool administered by a physiotherapist.</P>
<P>We considered other measures of function, including the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), which measures functional capability and level of independence in the areas of self-care, mobility and social function (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also sought studies where other outcome measures were used, including measures of ease of care, comfort and quality of life.</P>
<P>We also collected data regarding the subsequent need for orthopaedic surgery, safety and the economic implications of this therapy where these outcomes were reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors conducted an initial review of titles and abstracts of potentially eligible studies identified by the searches. Only those articles where there was sufficient information contained in the title and abstract to clearly determine that the study did not meet the selection criteria for the review were excluded at this stage.</P>
<P>Two authors then independently assessed the remaining trials in detail. We included studies if they were described as a randomised controlled trial or non-randomised controlled trial (i.e. another group received the same care but without intrathecal baclofen), at least 90% of the participants were diagnosed with spastic-type cerebral palsy, 90% of the participants were aged 0 to 18 years, the participants received intrathecal baclofen either by continuous infusion or intermittent bolus (either via an implanted or an externally-sited device) and if participants were assessed using at least one measure of spasticity (e.g. Ashworth scale) or gross motor function (e.g. GMFM). We also considered studies using other outcome measures for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>We resolved disagreements by conducting a joint review of the relevant studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Two authors extracted data from the published reports separately using a data collection form, resolving disagreements by joint review. We sought additional information, where required, through correspondence with the authors of the included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the included studies for methodological quality using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing bias, as described in Chapter 8 (section 8.5) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. We summarised the criteria for determining the risk of bias into an assessment form which contained the following domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias: including sequence generation and allocation concealment:</LI>
<LI>performance bias: blinding of participants to assigned intervention;</LI>
<LI>detection bias: blinding of those assessing outcome to allocation:</LI>
<LI>attrition bias: incomplete outcome data</LI>
<LI>reporting bias: selective outcome reporting</LI>
<LI>other bias: potential for carry-over effect in cross over study design</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two authors independently reviewed studies for methodological quality using these criteria. We both allocated a score for study quality in each of the domains above, rating the risk of bias as either low, medium or high. Disagreements were resolved by conducting a joint assessment.</P>
<P>Exploration of publication bias through assessment of funnel plot asymmetry was not possible due to unsuitability of the data obtained from the included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis (meta-analysis)</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis was not performed, as data obtained from the included studies were unsuitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis.This was for a number of reasons, including differing study designs, different outcome measures used and invalid statistical methods used in some included studies.</P>
<P>The studies were reasonably homogenous from a clinical and methodological viewpoint for the five studies utilising bolus administration of intrathecal baclofen. It is not possible to comment on statistical heterogeneity due to incomparable outcome data.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> study was a randomised trial of intrathecal baclofen therapy delivered via an implanted pump over 6 months versus a control group who did not receive a intrathecal baclofen pump.</P>
<P>The randomised controlled trial was only one component of the protocol in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK>). In both these studies the double-blind, randomised controlled trial was the first phase of the study. The code was broken at the end of this trial and the results used to determine which participants should receive implantable intrathecal baclofen pumps. The second phase of these studies involved an open-label, long-term intrathecal infusion of baclofen with no control group. The second phase of these studies is not considered in this review.</P>
<P>The references <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK> refer to two studies performed on the same group of participants after the same intervention, using different outcome measures. It is the same group of participants which was then randomised to receive either an intrathecal baclofen pump immediately or remain as a control group for the subsequent study reported in <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>, where continuous intrathecal baclofen therapy via implanted pump was evaluated against a control group who did not receive this therapy.</P>

<P>The characteristics of the participants in the included studies are described in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> ('Participant characteristics in included studies').</P>
<P>The participants in the included studies had spastic-type cerebral palsy, with a total of 76 children with quadriplegic distribution, 15 with diplegia and four described as paraplegic in distribution. The age range of the participants in the included studies ranged from 4 to 27 years. The method of classification of the severity of cerebral palsy varied between studies and included modes of classification based on degree of spasticity and gross motor function. <LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK> reports that participants in that study had moderate severity cerebral palsy, defined as those "whose gait and other movements might improve if their spasticity was alleviated and their muscles strengthened by physical therapy." <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK> reports participants in that study had severe cerebral palsy defined as "interfering with daily care or function." <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK> included children with severe cerebral palsy defined as "an average Ashworth scale score of three or more in the four lower extremity measurements." The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), developed in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Palisano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palisano 1997</LINK>) (subsequent to the publication of the two earlier studies, <LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>), was used by <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK> to classify the severity of cerebral palsy of participants, with the majority of participants in that study classified as GMFCS V (14 out of 17 participants), the most severe functional limitation category, where children have no means of independent mobility. One participant was classified as GMFCS III and two participants as GMFCS IV. 14 of 17 participants had quadriplegic distribution of spasticity and three had diplegic distribution. <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> reports on the same group of 17 children enrolled in the earlier studies by the same author.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK> undertook the randomised controlled trial in two groups of participants. Group one were 17 children with spastic cerebral palsy and group two were six participants with spasticity due to various disorders. The results obtained in these two groups were reported separately in the publication. Only data pertaining to group one are included in this review. In the <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK> study a total 19 participants were included, 10 with spastic cerebral palsy. The author was contacted to provide results for this group from the RCT phase, as this information was not available in the published report. This information was not available at the time of publication of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Five included studies involved paired baclofen and placebo bolus intrathecal injection in the same individuals. Escalating doses of baclofen were given versus placebo in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>). The dose range used was 10 to 100 µg. <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK> trialled 50 µg intrathecal injections of baclofen against placebo in a double-blind fashion. The study blind was broken after the completion of this step. If no positive response had occurred, subsequent higher doses of baclofen (75 µg, 100 µg) were given as open-label injections.</P>
<P>The mode of intrathecal baclofen delivery was via lumbar puncture or temporary devices (percutaneous spinal catheter or implanted port with spinal catheter) in all five of these studies. The only exception to this is in <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>, where five children underwent a modified protocol to reduce the risk of infection by avoiding repeated injections through the access port. In these children infusion pumps were inserted and the double-blind trial was performed on an outpatient basis.</P>
<P>The duration of the shorter-term studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>) ranged from 24 hours to eight days, however in the <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK> study the duration of the double-blind randomised controlled phase of the study is not clear from the published report. The children who underwent the regular protocol in this study had bolus injections on a daily basis, with a drug and placebo interval of four days and a washout period of at least two days. The five children who underwent the modified protocol in this study had a drug and placebo interval of 10 to 14 days with a washout period of four days, but the number of baclofen or placebo dosages trialled is not stated.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>) evaluated continuous intrathecal baclofen therapy via implanted pump (Synchromed, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis) in comparison to a control group with no implanted pump. Standard treatment, including any physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy was continued in both groups. This study followed on from the previous studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>) by the same author. The participants were administered intrathecal baclofen and placebo injections via lumbar puncture in the earlier studies. Given that all participants had a positive response, they were then randomised to receive an implanted programmable infusion pump after either one month (intervention group) or six months (control group). There was no placebo used in the control group and, after randomisation, treatment was open-label with no blinding of participants or investigators. Participants were evaluated after six months treatment. In the intervention group, the mean daily dose of intrathecal baclofen was 67 µg immediately after pump implantation and 176 µg six months later.</P>
<P>Oral baclofen was used in three studies in some participants. There was no comment regarding its use in <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK> (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> 'Use of oral baclofen').</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Ashworth scale scores were used as a primary outcome measure for the majority of studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>) and a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>) used the Ashworth scale score as a secondary outcome measure . <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK> employed electrophysiological measures of spasticity the primary outcome measure. <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> utilised the following primary outcome measures: Gross Motor Function Measure, 66 item (GMFM-66 - a measure of gross motor function, <LINK REF="REF-Russell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1989</LINK>), the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI -a measure of functional skills and need for caregiver assistance in daily life, <LINK REF="REF-Haley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1992</LINK>) and the The Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50 - a quality of life measure, <LINK REF="REF-Landgraf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landgraf 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> also utilised the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as a primary outcome measure for individually formulated problems.</P>

However, the Ashworth scale is an ordinal scale. It is not appropriate to produce mean Ashworth scores, as it is not a continuous variable and, as such, values which fall between the defined scoring numbers have no meaning, as the difference between the consecutive score values on the scale are not necessarily proportionate. For example, the distance between one and two on the Ashworth scale is not necessarily equivalent to the distance between two and three. Therefore, it is not appropriate to combine the outcome measures from the included studies into a summary statistic. Results of the individual studies are thus reported below without the mean Ashworth scale scores and without their associated statistical results.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK> used electrophysiological measures of spasticity, the H-reflex and the flexor reflex, as outcome measures.The H-reflex can be used as a tool to measure the excitability of neural components of the stretch reflex arc. The ratio of the maximal H amplitude to maximal M amplitude (H/M ratio) is considered an index of spasticity (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>). The flexor reflex is a polysynaptic and multisegmental spinal response which is influenced by spinal and supraspinal inputs. Lower limb flexor reflex excitability has been shown to be influenced by spasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Sandrini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandrini 2005</LINK>).</P>

Specifically, the PEDI caregiver assistance scale of the self-care domain was used as a primary outcome measure and the PEDI functional skills scale as a secondary outcome measure. The PEDI is an assessment of key functional capabilities and performance in children which is norm-referenced from age six months to 7.5 years. It measures what children actually do in the daily life and, as such, is an ICF activity-domain measure (<LINK REF="REF-Hayley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayley 2010</LINK>). The PEDI consists of two sections; functional skills and caregiver assistance. The functional skills section assess the child&#8217;s current repertoire of daily life skills in each of 3 domains (self-care, mobility and social function), whereas the Caregiver Assistance section assesses the extent to which the child&#8217;s overall performance of complex daily tasks such as dressing or moving around is supported by help from a caregiver (<LINK REF="REF-Hayley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayley 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The reported results of all studies in this review suggest intrathecal baclofen is effective for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK> reports that following intrathecal baclofen administration, "muscle tone in the lower extremities was significantly reduced but tone in upper extremities was not." There was no significant difference between the three doses (25 µg, 50 µg and 100 µg) in Ashworth score four hours after intrathecal baclofen bolus administration. Albright represented graphically the outcome of placebo and intrathecal baclofen injections. However, the placebo data are not published in the report.

The VAS scores were reported for individually formulated problems, with an average of three VAS scores per participant. In participants who nominated ease of care as a VAS goal (n=9 treatment group, n=7 control group), scores improved by a mean of 3.9 points (SD 2.2) in the treatment group and by a mean of 0.1 (SD 1.6) in the control group (p=0.008). In those who nominated pain as a goal area on the VAS (n=6 treatment group, n=6 control group), scores improved by a mean of 4.2 (SD 2.9) in the treatment group and worsened by in the control group with a mean of -1.3 (SD2.4) points (p=0.016)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Main findings of the review</HEADING>
<P>The randomised controlled trials in this review provide a little evidence that intrathecal baclofen is effective for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy in the short-term. The effect of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity in children with cerebral palsy in the longer term is less clear. </P>
<P>The evidence for the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen for treating spasticity in children with cerebral palsy is limited by small sample sizes and methodological issues, including high or unclear risk of bias, in the studies in this review.</P>
<P>Spasticity is an impairment at the body structure and function level. The aim of reducing spasticity by the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy is often to prevent or reduce the limitation at the activity and participation level or to address quality of life goals. For example, the ultimate goal may be to improve mobility and/or self-care or to increase participation at a social role level. The aim of reducing spasticity may also be directed at non-functional goals, such as to improve comfort, to increase the ease of care by others and to improve the overall quality of life of the individual.</P>
<P>Two studies demonstrate evidence that intrathecal baclofen reduces pain and improves ease of care (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a small amount of evidence from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>) that gross motor function and certain domains of health-related quality of life is improved with the use of intrathecal baclofen. Cautious interpretation of this result is required due to the small sample size and high risk of bias in the methodology in this study.</P>
<P>Many of the secondary questions of this review could not be addressed, as the short duration and temporary modes of intrathecal baclofen delivery utilised in the controlled trials included did not allow for the exploration of questions such as alteration in the subsequent need for orthopaedic surgery in children receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy, the rate of complications and the economic implications of this treatment when long-term therapy is administered via an implanted device. Evidence relating to these questions is unlikely to be derived from randomised controlled trials due to the limited duration of this type of study. Data collection over a period of some years is required to assess these outcomes. Given this, a discussion of the evidence available from published studies regarding these outcomes is included below.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome measures used to assess intrathecal baclofen therapy in children with cerebral palsy</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Spasticity</HEADING>
<P>The Ashworth scale (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 1964</LINK>) and the modified Ashworth scale (<LINK REF="REF-Bohannon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannon 1987</LINK>) are commonly employed and accepted measures of spasticity in clinical practice and clinical research. The original Ashworth scale was the outcome measure used for all studies included in this review. The advantages of the Ashworth scales are that they can be performed rapidly (<LINK REF="REF-Scholtes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholtes 2006</LINK>) and are therefore useful when serial assessments over several hours are performed, as in the studies included in this review. The disadvantages of utilising the Ashworth scale as a measure of spasticity relate to questions about its validity and reliability.</P>
<P>Spasticity is generally defined as a form of hypertonia where there is velocity-dependent resistance of muscle to passive stretch due to a heightened stretch reflex (Lance 1980, as cited in <LINK REF="REF-Dietz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheean-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheean 2002</LINK>). The validity and reliability of the Ashworth score as a measure of spasticity has been questioned. The Ashworth scale was originally developed to measure the efficacy of an anti-spasticity drug in adults with multiple sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 1964</LINK>). This scale was modified to the form now commonly used in clinical practice by the addition of a further category, 1+, with the aim of increasing its sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Bohannon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannon 1987</LINK>). The Ashworth scale and the modified Ashworth scale describe the resistance perceived by the examiner when moving a joint through its range of movement (except for category four, where the limb is rigid) at a single, unspecified speed. It is therefore poorly able to assess any velocity-dependent alteration in muscle resistance to passive movement. Thus, the Ashworth and modified Ashworth scale are measures of passive resistance to movement, rather than of spasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Damiano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damiano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandyan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandyan 1999</LINK>). The contribution of spasticity versus other causes of increased muscle activity and tone (voluntary and reflex) and altered muscle, tendon and joint viscoelastic properties, to the passive resistance to movement cannot be differentiated from spasticity by the use of the Ashworth scales (<LINK REF="REF-Damiano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damiano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandyan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandyan 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relevance of this theoretical limitation to the use of the Ashworth scale as a measure of spasticity for assessing the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen therapy is not of great significance in practice, however. In the absence of other interventions that alter musculoskeletal viscoelastic properties, this component is likely to stay constant over the short term. Other causes of hypertonia, such as dystonia, may confound Ashworth scores in the context of assessing intrathecal baclofen therapy. In a clinical context, however, differentiating the relative contribution of spasticity and dystonia to the Ashworth score in a child with cerebral palsy is of uncertain importance as intrathecal baclofen addresses both these causes of hypertonicity. Intrathecal baclofen may be an effective treatment for the secondary dystonia seen in cerebral palsy, although high level evidence is not yet available (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Albright-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dachy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dachy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woon 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies investigating the reliability of the Ashworth scale have also shown mixed results. The interrater and intrarater (test-retest) reliability of the modified forms of the scale have been variable and frequently poor in studies performed in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Clopton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clopton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fosang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fosang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yam-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yam 2006</LINK>). There are few data available regarding the reliability of the original form of the scale in children with cerebral palsy, but in studies in other patient groups, the interrater reliability of the original form of the Ashworth scale (as used by all studies in this review) is somewhat better than the modified scale (<LINK REF="REF-Brashear-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brashear 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1996</LINK>). Protocols which use a single rater, as did the <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> studies, for assessing Ashworth scores remove the issue of interrater reliability.</P>
<P>The Tardieu scale, as originally described by Held in 1969 (<LINK REF="REF-Scholtes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholtes 2006</LINK>), and the modified Tardieu scale (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>) may be a more valid and reliable measure of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. The original Tardieu scale assesses passive movement of the joints at three specified velocities, noting the duration of muscle reaction to stretch and the joint angle at which the muscle reaction is first felt. It is therefore very time-consuming (<LINK REF="REF-Scholtes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholtes 2006</LINK>). The modified Tardieu scale defines only the joint angle at which muscle resistance is first encountered ('the catch') during rapid velocity movement (as fast as possible, faster than the natural drop of the limb segment under gravity (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>).This examination is accompanied by measurement of joint range of motion using a slow speed of movement (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>), thereby identifying the velocity-dependant component of resistance to passive movement. The construct validity of the Tardieu scales as a measure of spasticity is greater than that of the Ashworth scales and this has been supported by experimental studies of its validity (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patrick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 2006</LINK>). The reported interrater reliability of the modified Tardieu scale, however, has been found to be somewhat variable in studies involving children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Fosang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fosang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yam-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yam 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of instrumented biomechanical and electrophysiological measures of spasticity have also been developed. These include the H-reflex and flexor reflex, as used by Hoving (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>), instrumented torque and EMG measurements during passive motion at preset velocities, ramp and hold tests, pendulum tests and others (<LINK REF="REF-Damiano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damiano 2002</LINK>). A complete review of these measures will not be discussed as part of this systematic review. None of these are in common use in the clinical setting.</P>
<P>As discussed previously, the issue of whether measures of spasticity are the most relevant outcome measure for assessing the efficacy of intrathecal baclofen therapy needs to be considered. The question of whether reduction of spasticity maximises function at the activity and participation levels, or improves the quality of life of the individual, must be addressed. For this reason, the use of outcome measures which evaluate function at the activity and participation level and those which address comfort and quality of life of the individual and ease of care by others are required to assess the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in addition to measures of spasticity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gross Motor Function and Other Measures of Function</HEADING>
<P>Changes in the ICF dimensions of activity and participation with the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy were examined by one of the randomised controlled trials included in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>. The GMFM-66 is a well-validated and in widely used as a measure of gross motor function in clinical settings and in research (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>). The PEDI is similarly well-validated activity-level measure in wide use across clinical and research settings (<LINK REF="REF-Hayley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayley 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ease of Care, Comfort and Quality of Life</HEADING>
<P>Care and comfort outcome measures were used by two studies in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>). It may be argued that these measures are of the greatest importance in assessing the effect of intrathecal baclofen in individuals with severe cerebral palsy (GMFCS IV and V). The visual analogue scale (VAS) for individually formulated problems was the outcome measure used in both these studies, with a majority of participants nominating pain and ease of care as problem areas.</P>
<P>Health-related quality of life is a construct which encompasses the impact of health status, including disease and treatment, on physical, psychological and social functioning (<LINK REF="REF-de-Lissovoy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lissovoy 2007</LINK>).The Child Health Questionnaire is a generic (rather than disease-specific) measure of health-related quality of life. The advantage of generic measures is that they are appropriate for use in all children and normative values have been generated which provide a baseline with which to make comparisons of children with disabilities, such as cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2008</LINK>). Evaluation of the CHQ in studies to date has demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2008</LINK>). However, when assessing the effect of an intervention in children with cerebral palsy, a cerebral palsy-specific measure may have been a more appropriate tool (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in treating children with cerebral palsy</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Spasticity</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the studies included in this systematic review indicate that intrathecal baclofen may be effective in reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, but the evidence is limited by the small sample sizes used and inappropriate statistical methods used in two of the studies.</P>
<P>Six studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, five of which used spasticity as a primary outcome measure and a sixth used spasticity as a secondary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>). One of these studies had not reported the results of the randomised controlled phase of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1997</LINK>) and therefore did not contribute any data to this review. The incorrect statistical handling of Ashworth scores by a further two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK>), introduces difficulty in determining the validity of the results of these studies.</P>
<P>Of the other studies included in the review, two were short-term (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2007</LINK>) and one was conducted over 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>). The short term studies demonstrated reduction of spasticity with the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> reported that reduction in spasticity with continuous intrathecal baclofen therapy was demonstrated in only a minority of muscle groups at 6 months compared to baseline.</P>
<P>In summary, therefore, reduction in spasticity was seen in four short-term randomised controlled trials with adequate methodology and of small size, but two of these studies have utilised questionable statistical analysis. A fifth randomised controlled study, which examined the use of intrathecal baclofen via implanted pump over six months demonstrated minimal reduction of spasticity.</P>
<P>The magnitude of the treatment effect of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity cannot be determined by this review due to the inability to calculate a summary statistic from the outcome measures used in the studies. The Ashworth scale is an ordinal measure and therefore it is not statistically valid to average or summate scores. It was also not possible to discuss statistical heterogeneity in this instance.</P>
<P>In future, meta-analysis of Ashworth scale data may be possible if outcome data from future controlled studies can be dichotomised into two groups (following treatment with either intrathecal baclofen or placebo), as: 1. No improvement in Ashworth score 2. Improvement in Ashworth score by one or more points.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gross Motor Function</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> utilised the GMFM to investigate the effect of intrathecal baclofen therapy on mobility and self-care. A positive impact was seen on gross motor function with the use of intrathecal baclofen reported in <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>. The treatment group demonstrated a small, statistically significant improvement in the 66 item GMFM score, with a mean improvement of 1.2 points (SD 2.3) in the treatment group and a mean worsening of -1.3 points (SD 2.4)in the control group. No statistically significant difference was seen in the individual dimensions of the 88 Item GMFM (lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running and jumping) between the treatment and control groups. Although the change seen in GMFM-66 is small, it is probably of clinical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Oeffinger-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeffinger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, as mentioned previously, this result should be viewed with some caution due to the small sample size and risk of bias in the methodology, as there was no use of placebo in the control group and no blinding of either participants or investigators after randomisation. The deterioration in various outcome measures in the control group from baseline over the six months of the study may be explained by the participants and investigators knowing that the control had been selected to receive intrathecal baclofen treatment at a delayed time-point to the treatment group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other Measures of Function</HEADING>
<P>No change in self-care or other functional abilities, as measured by the PEDI functional skills and caregiver assistance scales, was seen with intrathecal baclofen treatment in the <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009b</LINK> study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ease of Care, Comfort and Quality of Life</HEADING>
<P>Health-related quality of life, as measured by the CHQ-PF50, in the <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> study was found to improve in children treated with intrathecal baclofen therapy in several domains of the measure: psychosocial summary, bodily pain/discomfort, parental impact-time and mental health. This is an important finding given that the ultimate goals of intrathecal baclofen treatment may often encompass improvement in heath-related quality of life and the lack of evidence in the literature about the impact of this intervention upon this objective. Again, however, the lack of a placebo or blinding of either participants or investigators to allocation after randomisation introduces the risk of bias and these results should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Need for Subsequent Orthopaedic Surgery</HEADING>
<P>It has been proposed that reducing spasticity by treating children with intrathecal baclofen leads to a reduced rate of muscle contracture and bony deformity and hence reduces the need for orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Hagglund-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hagglund 2005</LINK>). There is also concern that intrathecal baclofen may increase the rate of spinal deformity.These questions cannot be addressed by the short-term, controlled trials included in this review, as data collection over a longer period would be required to ascertain this.</P>
<P>In relation to this question, <LINK REF="REF-Gerszten-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerszten 1998</LINK> completed retrospective analysis of 48 children who had received intrathecal baclofen pumps with a mean follow up period of 53 months found that orthopaedic surgery was planned at the time of pump insertion for 28 participants, but was subsequently required in only 10 children. In all participants who underwent surgery after intrathecal baclofen pump placement, this surgery had been planned prior to the pump insertion and the most commonly performed procedure was femoral osteotomy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Krach-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 2003</LINK> studied hip status in children with cerebral palsy one year after pump implantation (following on from the <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK> study). The rate of change of migration percentage from baseline was 1.3%, a rate statistically significantly less than the 5% per year reported as the expected natural rate of progression in children with cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>Scoliosis is common in children with cerebral palsy, with a wide variation in reported incidence of 6.5-76% (<LINK REF="REF-Loeters-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeters 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shilt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shilt 2008</LINK>), with the highest incidence occurring in non-ambulatory children (<LINK REF="REF-Saito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saito 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lonstein-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonstein 1983</LINK>). Interpreting studies which seek to address the question of the influence of intrathecal baclofen upon spinal deformity is made more complex by issues relating to the high (but not precisely defined) background incidence of scoliosis in children with cerebral palsy and the large number of factors which can influence its development and progression. Also, the timing of intrathecal baclofen pump insertion in relation to skeletal maturity might also influence the rate of scoliotic curve progression, but again there is little evidence in the published literature to confirm this.</P>
<P>There are a number of published retrospective case series (<LINK REF="STD-Burn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Burn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ginsburg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsburg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sansone-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sansone 2006</LINK>) and case-control studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Krach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seneran-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Seneran 2007</LINK>), with the majority of these suggesting an increased incidence or rate of progression of scoliosis with the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy. Evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Shilt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shilt 2008</LINK> prospective cohort study determined that there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of progression of Cobb angles (6.6 degrees per year in the ITB group versus 5.0 degrees per year in the control group). The study compared individuals with cerebral palsy receiving ITB with a control group of children with cerebral palsy matched for age, sex, topographic motor involvement and initial Cobb angle (but not for GMFCS level). However, it should be noted that the method used to identify control participants may have been biased towards selection of patients with more significant scoliotic curves or curve progression, given that these participants were identified retrospectively from a clinic database, and only those individuals with at least two spinal radiographs on record were eligible for inclusion in the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety of Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy</HEADING>
<P>The frequency and nature of complications is an important consideration in assessing the risk-benefit ratio of intrathecal baclofen therapy, particularly given that intrathecal baclofen therapy has the potential to cause adverse events of a life-threatening nature.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review are unable to answer this question as they were conducted over a short time period and most utilised temporary modes of intrathecal drug delivery, with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK>) utilising implantable pumps versus standard care for six months.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> article does not report on the safety of the continuous intrathecal baclofen therapy studied, but rather reports on this in a separate paper (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009b</LINK> reports on adverse events recorded prospectively for a mean of 18.4 months from the insertion of an intrathecal baclofen pump (range 12-24 months). Eighty adverse events were recorded for the study population of 17 children, eight of which were serious, but not life-threatening in nature. Three of these serious adverse events were device-related complications requiring further surgery and four were drug-related (dysphagia, dysarthria, excessive hypotonia). One participant had new onset of seizures, although it is not clear that this was related to the use of intrathecal baclofen.</P>
<P>Elsewhere in the literature, exploration of the evidence available regarding the long-term safety of intrathecal baclofen in children with cerebral palsy reveals a large number of case series (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Albright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borowski-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Borowski 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krach-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rippe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rippe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK>). Several of these report on large number of paediatric participants (63-200 individuals) followed for significant periods of time (mean durations of 50-70 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borowski-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Borowski 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2007</LINK>). Overall, these series reveal the rate of significant complications to be around 30% over the long term in those receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2007</LINK> calculated an incidence of one significant complication every 11.3 years of treatment</P>
<P>Of the serious complications of ITB therapy, common adverse events include device related complications, with catheter-related complications (disconnection, obstruction, migrations, tears and fractures) the most frequent complications seen in long-term intrathecal baclofen therapy, occurring in 10% to 30% of individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Albright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borowski-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Borowski 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krach-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rippe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rippe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK>;). Pump-related infections are also common, occurring in around 8% to 11% of individuals(<LINK REF="STD-Albright-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Albright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borowski-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Borowski 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krach-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rippe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rippe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK>;). Cerebrospinal fluid leaks have been reported in 3% to 17% of individuals receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krach-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilmartin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilmartin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In relation to life expectancy, the best available published evidence does not show any increased mortality from the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Krach-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Krach 2010</LINK> reports on a matched cohort study comparing survival in 359 individuals with cerebral palsy receiving intrathecal baclofen treatment with individuals without ITB pumps, matched for age, sex GMFCS level, the presence of epilepsy and feeding tube use. This study found no significant difference in survival curves between the two groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Economic implications</HEADING>
<P>The cost-effectiveness of ITB was not addressed by the randomised controlled trials included in this review, but Dutch Study Group on Child Spasticity conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside their randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2008</LINK>). A number of other studies have examined the economic costs versus the benefits of intrathecal baclofen therapy via mathematical modelling (<LINK REF="STD-Bensmail-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bensmail 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Lissovoy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lissovoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2008</LINK> determined in their cost-utility analysis that the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for ITB was &#1013;32,737 (US $36,665) in the year 2003. This was determined by prospective recording via a questionnaire and cost diary kept by the participants of the intervention and other health care costs in comparison with a retrospective questionnaire for the year preceding the ITB treatment.This cost per QALY is similar to US $42,000 per QALY modelled by <LINK REF="REF-de-Lissovoy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lissovoy 2007</LINK> in the context of the US health care system, but higher than the cost per QALY modelled by <LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2002</LINK> in the United Kingdom of US $10,550-$19,570. All these costs are well within the range that is widely accepted as offering good value for money (<LINK REF="REF-de-Lissovoy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lissovoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2008</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of bias in review outcome</HEADING>
<P>There is a clear risk of bias in the findings of this review.</P>
<P>A high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding of participants and those assessing outcome to treatment allocation in the <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2009a</LINK> study. These biases may have influenced the findings of worsening of the visual analogue scale scores, GMFM-66,and a number of the CHQ-PF50 domains in the control group from baseline to reassessment after six months. These are variables that would not be expected to alter over six months duration in the control group. This may have lead to an incorrect finding of a statistically significant difference between the intrathecal baclofen treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>All studies in the review had small sample sizes, which can be more likely to be biased towards positive findings.</P>
<P>A particular limitation of this review is that three of the six included studies were from the same group of researchers and the studies performed on the same group of participants. Any biases inherent in these studies may therefore have been similar for all three studies, thus biasing the review outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Potential bias in the conduct of the review</HEADING>
<P>A thorough search of the published literature has been conducted in this review and it is likely that all published studies from journals indexed in the databases searched and trial registers have been identified.</P>
<P>Publication bias is difficult to overcome, although attempts were also made to identify unpublished studies via handsearching of conference proceedings and contact with researchers and with drug and device manufacturing companies. No unpublished studies were able to be identified.</P>

<P>Intrathecal baclofen may be an effective therapy for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, but the evidence for this is limited to date.</P>
<P>At present, there is a small amount of evidence from randomised controlled trials which suggest that that intrathecal baclofen is effective for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy in the short-term. The effect of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity outcomes in children with cerebral palsy in the long-term is less certain. The validity of the evidence is constrained by the small sample sizes of the studies and methodological issues in the studies.</P>
<P>Spasticity is a impairment in the domain of body structure and function and consideration must also be given to the broader context in determining whether intrathecal baclofen therapy is effective. The aim of therapy may be, for example, to improve motor function, to increase participation at a social role level, to improve comfort, to improve the ease of care by others or to improve the overall quality of life of the individual. There is some evidence that intrathecal baclofen improves ease of care and the comfort and quality of life of the individuals receiving it, but again small sample sizes and methodological issues in the studies mean that these results should be interpreted with caution. Intrathecal baclofen therapy may improve gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy, but more reliable evidence is required.</P>
<P>The short duration of the studies included in this review did not allow for the exploration of questions regarding whether the subsequent need for orthopaedic surgery in children receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy is altered, or the safety and the economic implications of intrathecal baclofen treatment when long-term therapy is administered via an implanted device.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-27 03:13:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further evidence of the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen for treating spasticity, increasing gross motor function, improving comfort, ease of care and quality of life is required from other investigators in order to validate these results. In particular, evidence of the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen for treating spasticity over longer durations of therapy is needed.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that randomised controlled trials will provide answers to the questions of whether the subsequent need for orthopaedic surgery in children receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy is altered, the long-term safety of the therapy and its economic implications. Cohort studies may be more an appropriate study design to answer these questions.</P>
