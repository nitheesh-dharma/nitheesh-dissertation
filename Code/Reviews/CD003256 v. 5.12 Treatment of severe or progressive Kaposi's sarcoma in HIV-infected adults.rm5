<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-23 09:44:46 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma was the first tumor to be described in association with HIV infection and is an AIDS-defining condition. It is also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) as Herpes virus 8 (HHV8) is recognized as an essential and necessary factor in the pathogenesis of KS. Nonetheless, not all HHV-8-infected individuals will develop the disease. The abnormal cells of KS form purple, red, or brown patches, plaques or tumors on the skin. There is no universally accepted system for staging Kaposi's sarcoma. The most commonly used staging system for AIDS-related KS in adults is the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) staging.</P>
<P>This review evaluated the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and chemotherapy, or different chemotherapy regimens for severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV infected adults.</P>
<P>We found six randomised controlled trials and three observational studies that assessed the effects of HAART plus chemotherapy compared with HAART alone; HAART plus chemotherapy compared with HAART plus another chemotherapy regimen; and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy in the time before HAART was available. Of the nine included studies, seven included patients with a mix of mild to moderate (T0) Kaposi's sarcoma and severe (T1) Kaposi's sarcoma. There was no universal definition for what severity of disease was considered chemotherapy-requiring. For this review, we only extracted data for 792 HIV infected adults with severe Kaposi's sarcoma disease.</P>
<P>The findings from this review suggest that HAART plus chemotherapy may be beneficial in reducing disease progression compared to HAART alone in patients with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma. For patients on HAART, in choosing among different chemotherapy regimens, there was no observed difference between liposomal doxorubcin, liposomal daunorubicin, and paclitaxel. The overall quality of evidence in this review can be described as moderate.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:30 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six randomised trials and three observational studies involving 792 HIV-infected adults with severe Kaposi's sarcoma. Seven studies included patients with a mix of mild to moderate (T0) and severe (T1) Kaposi's sarcoma. However, this review was restricted to the subset of participants with severe Kaposi's sarcoma disease.</P>
<P>Studies comparing HAART plus chemotherapy to HAART alone showed the following: one trial comparing HAART plus doxorubicin, bleomycin and vincristine (ABV) to HAART alone showed a significant reduction in disease progression in the HAART plus ABV group (RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.75, 100 participants); there was no statistically significant reduction in mortality and no difference in adverse events. A cohort study comparing liposomal anthracyclines plus HAART to HAART alone showed a non-statistically significant reduction in Kaposi's sarcoma immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in patients that received HAART plus liposomal anthracyclines (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.55, 129 participants).</P>
<P>Studies comparing HAART plus chemotherapy to HAART plus a different chemotherapy regimen showed the following: one trial involving 49 participants and comparing paclitaxel versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients on HAART showed no difference in disease progression. Another trial involving 46 patients and comparing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus liposomal daunorubicin showed no participants with progressive Kaposi's sarcoma disease in either group.</P>
<P>Studies comparing different chemotherapy regimens in patients from the pre-HAART era showed the following: in the single RCT comparing liposomal daunorubicin to ABV, there was no significant difference with the use of liposomal daunorubicin compared to ABV in disease progression (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.82, 227 participants) and overall response rate. Another trial involving 178 participants and comparing oral etoposide versus ABV demonstrated no difference in mortality in either group. A non-randomised trial comparing bleomycin alone to ABV demonstrated a higher median survival time in the ABV group; there was also a non-statistically significant reduction in adverse events and disease progression in the ABV group (RR 11; 95% CI 0.67 to 179.29, 24 participants). An additional non-randomised study showed a non-statistically significant overall mortality benefit from liposomal doxorubicin as compared to conservative management consisting of either bleomycin plus vinblastine, vincristine or single-agent antiretroviral therapy alone (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.15, 29 participants). The overall quality of evidence can be described as moderate quality. The quality of evidence was downgraded due to the small size of many of the included studies and small number of events.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:38 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, have become common comorbidities afflicting HIV-infected individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Casper-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casper 2011</LINK>). Kaposi's sarcoma was the first tumour to be described in association with HIV infection and is an AIDS-defining condition. Kaposi's sarcoma remains the most common HIV-associated cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second most common cancer in HIV-infected patients worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Gantt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gantt 2010</LINK>). Since the introduction of 'highly active antiretroviral therapy' (HAART) or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), there has been a rapid decline in the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma, especially in Western countries where HAART is readily available (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Lorenzo_x00a0_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Lorenzo  2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mocroft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mocroft 2004</LINK>). The reduction in incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma is less clear in resource poor settings (<LINK REF="REF-Semeere-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semeere 2012</LINK>). However, it continues to be diagnosed in HIV-infected patients, even among patients with effective viral load suppression and high CD4 counts (<LINK REF="REF-Khanlou-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanlou 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maurer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurer 2007</LINK>). Survival after a diagnosis of KS in the modern HAART era continues to be sub-optimal in resource poor settings (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2013</LINK>). Together, incident cases and poor survival in some settings emphasises the importance of understanding the treatment options for severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma. <BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:36 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Kaposi's sarcoma is thought to originate from herpes virus 8 (HHV8)-infected lymphatic endothelial cells and is also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). HHV8 is recognised as an essential and necessary factor in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>). Nonetheless, not all HHV-8-infected individuals will develop the disease.</P>
<P>Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are comprised of both distinctive spindle cells that line lymph or blood vessels and a variable inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting that it may result from reactive hyperproliferation induced by chronic inflammation and is not a true neoplasm (<LINK REF="REF-Martellotta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martellotta 2009</LINK>).The abnormal cells of Kaposi's sarcoma form purple or brown patches, plaques or tumours on the skin. Biopsy for definitive diagnosis is recommended to distinguish Kaposi's sarcoma from other skin conditions that can look similar, which may include bacillary angiomatosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cutaneous fungal or bacterial infections<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Krown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krown 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no universally accepted system for staging AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The most commonly used staging system for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in adults was developed by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) of the National Institutes of Health (<LINK REF="REF-Krown-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krown 1989</LINK>). It is important to note that this staging system is most frequently used in research. Clinically, patients may be grouped more generally by a clinician into either a) sick patients needing an immediate fast-acting intervention (clinically severe Kaposi's sarcoma) or b) those patients that can be treated with HAART alone (clinically mild to moderate Kaposi's sarcoma). There is continued debate in the literature as to the definition of the severity of KS that is truly requiring of immediate fast-acting intervention as compared to HAART alone, and different definitions have been used in different studies (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In ACTG staging, patients are categorised according to three parameters.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Extent of tumour (T): a favourable prognosis (T0) is associated with disease limited to the skin or with minimal involvement of the oral cavity. Those with associated lymphoedema, more extensive oral cavity involvement or other visceral disease are considered to have a poor prognosis (T1).</LI>
<LI>Immune status (I): the degree of immunosuppression from the HIV infection is an important prognostic factor. Patients with a CD4 count greater than 200 cells/µl are considered to have a favourable prognosis (I0), while those with a lower CD4 count are classified as having a poor prognosis (I1).</LI>
<LI>Severity of systemic illness (S): features associated with a poor risk included the following (S1): a history of opportunistic infection, thrush, B symptoms (fever, night sweats, significant weight loss, diarrhoea for more than two weeks). Patients without any of these factors have a more favourable prognosis (S0).</LI>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:38 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>HAART has been a very important step in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and has led to a substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carrieri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrieri 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Di-Lorenzo_x00a0_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Lorenzo  2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engels-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engels 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grulich-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grulich 2001</LINK>). In addition to HAART, many other potential systemic and local therapeutic regimens exist, which have been studied in HIV-infected adults. Generally, more widespread disease, or disease affecting internal organs, is treated with systemic therapy (including interferon alpha, liposomal anthracyclines or paclitaxel). Liposomal anthracyclines were found in the previous version of this Cochrane review to have a superior response rate without an increase in toxic side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dedicoat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dedicoat 2003</LINK>), and have been adopted by many as first-line therapy for severe Kaposi's sarcoma (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Trolio-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Trolio 2006</LINK>). However, at this time there are no guidelines from the World Health Organization regarding liposomal anthracyclines as first-line therapy and access to these drugs is still very limited in the developing world. Since the prior Cochrane review, more studies have been published in this area, necessitating an update of the literature. With the advent of ART, local treatment is often reserved for patients who do not respond to systemictherapy.                                       </P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-23 09:54:24 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The incidence of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma remains high in many countries where HIV-1 is prevalent, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This review aims to identify high-quality studies of therapy for clinically severe or treatment-refractory Kaposi's sarcoma. Studies using HAART plus chemotherapy or different chemotherapy regimens in both the pre- andpost-HAART era will be included. The previous version of this review included HIV-1-infected adult patients with both mild and severe/progressive Kaposi's sarcoma (<LINK REF="REF-Dedicoat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dedicoat 2003</LINK>). However, this update of the review will be restricted to severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma. Another ongoing Cochrane systematic review will address treatment for mild and moderate Kaposi's sarcoma in ART-naive HIV-infected individuals. We aim to present the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational studies. The findings from our review will help to guide policy and practice on the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in adults with HIV infection.</P>

For all studies, we extracted data only for participants meeting criteria of severe disease, as defined above. All included studies did measure ACTG stage, and ultimately were able to provide results according to stage after communication with study authors. Therefore, for all included papers, only patients with T1 disease were included. Of note, the two studies included in the prior Cochrane review on Kaposi's sarcoma were not included in the current review due to a mix of Kaposi's sarcoma stages; T1 disease patients could not be separated from T0 (<LINK REF="STD-Northfelt--1998" TYPE="STUDY">Northfelt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:47 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six randomised trials involving 610 HIV-infected adults with severe Kaposi's sarcoma (<LINK REF="STD-Cianfrocca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cianfrocca 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cooley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gill-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Carbonero-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Carbonero 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mosam 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olweny-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olweny 2005</LINK>), and three observational studies involving a total of 182 HIV-infected adults with severe Kaposi's sarcoma (<LINK REF="STD-Bower-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bower 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gr_x00fc_naug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grünaug 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1997</LINK>). None of the included studies with the same study design compared similar interventions. Of the nine included studies, seven included patients with a mix of mild to moderate (T0) and severe (T1) Kaposi's sarcoma. However, this review was restricted to severe disease only, therefore we only extracted data for T1 Kaposi's sarcoma participants. There was no universal consensus in included studies on the severity of disease that is truly requiring of chemotherapy.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Dedicoat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dedicoat 2003</LINK>), two large randomised trials (total of 499 T0 and T1 Kaposi's sarcoma patients) were pooled: <LINK REF="STD-Northfelt--1998" TYPE="STUDY">Northfelt 1998</LINK>, comparing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) to doxorubicin, bleomycin and vincristine (ABV), and <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>, comparing PLD to bleomycin and vincristine. However, we excluded these studies from our update of the review because the results were not available according to Kaposi's sarcoma stage. The pooled analysis showed similar mortality and adverse events in both arms, but clinical response, which included complete and partial response, favoured PLD.</P>
<P>Of the trials comparing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) plus chemotherapy to HAART alone for patients with T1 Kaposi's sarcoma, only <LINK REF="STD-Mosam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mosam 2012</LINK>, comparing HAART plus ABV to HAART alone, showed a significant reduction in disease progression in the HAART plus ABV group. There also appeared to be a reduction in mortality and adverse events but these were not statistically significant. It should be noted that the sickest patients requiring urgent chemotherapy were excluded from this trial, so it is possible that this is an underestimate of the reduction in morbidity and possibly mortality associated with ABV when added to HAART. Another trial involving 10 patients and comparing HAART plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to HAART alone did not show any significant benefit in clinical response, but was of very small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Carbonero-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Carbonero 2004</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Bower-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bower 2009</LINK> cohort included patients on HAART alone and also on HAART plus liposomal anthracycline but was not designed to compare these two groups. A subset of this cohort was presented in <LINK REF="STD-Letang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Letang 2013</LINK> which showed a non-statistically significant reduction in Kaposi's sarcoma immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in patients that received HAART plus liposomal anthracyclines, but no difference in mortality between groups. All T1 Kaposi's sarcoma patients in this study were meant to receive chemotherapy as per protocol; patients who received HAART alone were therefore exceptions.</P>
<P>Of the studies comparing HAART plus chemotherapy to HAART plus a different chemotherapy regimen, <LINK REF="STD-Cianfrocca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cianfrocca 2010</LINK>, involving 49 T1 patients and comparing paclitaxel versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients on HAART, did not demonstrate a difference between the two groups in disease progression or clinical response. Another trial involving 46 T1 disease patients, comparing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to liposomal daunorubicin, showed no participants with progressive Kaposi's sarcoma disease in either group (<LINK REF="STD-Cooley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cooley 2007</LINK>). We did not identify any randomised controlled studies from the modern HAART era that directly compared HAART plus liposomal anthracyclines to HAART plus ABV. In addition, we did not identify any studies that evaluated timing of chemotherapy, i.e. whether there was a benefit to starting chemotherapy prior to HAART as compared to simultaneous administration.</P>
<P>Other studies compared different chemotherapy regimens in patients from the pre-HAART era: <LINK REF="STD-Gill-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gill 1996</LINK>, involving 227 patients, compared liposomal daunorubicin to ABV and showed no significant difference with the use of liposomal daunorubicin compared to ABV in disease progression and overall response rate. The exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Northfelt--1998" TYPE="STUDY">Northfelt 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK> studies is discussed above. <LINK REF="STD-Olweny-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olweny 2005</LINK>, a trial involving 178 patients comparing oral etoposide versus ABV in patients not on antiretroviral therapy, demonstrated no significant difference in mortality between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1997</LINK>, a prospective non-randomised trial (24 patients) comparing bleomycin to ABV in the pre-HAART era, demonstrated a higher mean survival time and no reported adverse events in the ABV group. However, there was no significant difference in disease progression between the two groups. An additional retrospective study, involving 29 patients in the pre-HAART era, showed a non-statistically significant overall mortality benefit for liposomal doxorubicin compared to conservative management consisting of either bleomycin plus vinblastine, vincristine or single-agent antiretroviral therapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Gr_x00fc_naug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grünaug 1998</LINK>). Liposomal doxorubicin also showed a significant survival time benefit.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:50 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The trials included HIV-infected adults with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma, as defined by AIDS Clinical Trial Group T1 or progressive disease. We identified no studies on the relative timing of HAART in relationship to chemotherapy. Most of the included studies were not designed or powered specifically to address outcomes for patients with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma. We were not able to do a subgroup analysis to assess if there were particular subgroups within the population of patients with T1 KS that would benefit more or less from chemotherapy. Some of the outcomes addressed in the studies could not be reported here because they were not presented according to disease severity (i.e. mixed T0 and T1). The studies were conducted in both resource-poor and rich settings. Therefore, the findings from this review are applicable to various settings, but identified major gaps in the literature as above.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-25 11:50:59 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and presented this in the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-09" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 9</LINK>). The overall quality of evidence in this review can be described as moderate. We downgraded the quality of evidence due to the small size of many of the included studies and the low numbers of events.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-05-26 11:24:36 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a comprehensive search of databases and conference proceedings and we contacted experts in the field to ensure that all relevant completed, unpublished or ongoing studies were identified. There was no language restriction. We also contacted study authors where possible for clarification where this was required and for unpublished data where necessary. Unpublished data was included in the review. We minimised potential bias in the conduct of this review by having at least two authors independently scan through the search output, extract data and assess the methodological quality of each study.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:51 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only data from comparison of liposomal anthracyclines with ABV come from the pre-HAART era; in contrast to the prior Cochrane review <LINK REF="REF-Dedicoat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dedicoat 2003</LINK>, the single study in this comparison included here did not show a definitive advantage from liposomal anthracyclines over ABV. However, two large randomised controlled trials on this topic had to be excluded due to their mix of mild and severe Kaposi's sarcoma patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-07-23 10:19:10 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings from this review suggest that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) plus chemotherapy may be beneficial in reducing disease progression compared to HAART alone in patients with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma. For patients on HAART, when choosing from different chemotherapy regimens, there was no observed difference between liposomal doxorubicin, liposomal daunorubicin and paclitaxel.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-29 16:09:51 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future studies should be designed and powered specifically to address outcomes for patients with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma and the results should be presented according to disease severity. The delineation of what severity of disease truly needs chemotherapy in addition to HAART, and who may be treated with HAART alone, has yet to be firmly established. While this review demonstrates that there is at least a treatment response advantage to adding chemotherapy to HAART in patients with T1 disease, this does not necessarily mean that ACTG tumour staging is the most appropriate cut-off for clinicians to use when deciding who to treat with chemotherapy. For example, there may be subgroups of T1 patients that could be treated with HAART alone, or subgroups within T0 that require immediate anti-KS therapy. The studies included in this review were not powered in such a way to allow us to perform sub-group analyses. There is also a need for research on the relative timing of HAART in relation to chemotherapy for severe Kaposi's sarcoma, and the potential role of chemotherapy in preventing or treating Kaposi's sarcoma immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.</P>

<I>SELECTION </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>1) Representativeness of the exposed cohort (NB exposure = intervention) </B>
</P>
<P>Item is assessing the representativeness of exposed individuals in the community, not the representativeness of the study sample from some general population. For example, subjects derived from groups likely to contain exposed people are likely to be representative of exposed individuals, while they are not representative of all people the community.</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation of points as per rating sheet. </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>2) Selection of the non-exposed cohort </B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation of points as per rating sheet. </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>3) Ascertainment of exposure </B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation of points as per rating sheet. </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>4) Demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study </B>
</P>
<P>In the case of mortality studies, outcome of interest is still the presence of a disease/incident, rather than death. That is to say that a statement of no history of disease or incident earns a point.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>COMPARABILITY </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>1) Comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis</B>
</P>
<P>Either exposed or non-exposed individuals must be matched in the design and/or confounders must be adjusted for in the analysis. Statements of no differences between groups or that differences were not statistically significant are not sufficient for establishing comparability. Note: If the relative risk for the exposure of interest is adjusted for the confounders listed, then the groups will be considered to be comparable on each variable used in the adjustment.</P>
<P>
<I>A maximum of 2 points can be allotted in this category. </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>OUTCOME </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>2) Assessment of outcome </B>
</P>
<P>For some outcomes, reference to the medical record is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for confirmation. This may not be adequate for other outcomes where reference to specific tests or measures would be required.</P>
<P>a) Independent or blind assessment stated in the paper, or confirmation of the outcome by reference to secure records (health records, etc.)</P>
<P>b) Record linkage (e.g. identified through ICD codes on database records)</P>
<P>c) Self<B> </B>report (i.e. no reference to original health records or documented source to confirm the outcome)</P>
<P>d) No description</P>
<P>
<B>3) Was follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur?</B>
</P>
<P>An acceptable length of time should be decided before quality assessment begins.</P>
<P>
<B>4) Adequacy of follow-up of cohorts</B>
</P>
<P>This item assesses the follow-up of the exposed and non-exposed cohorts to ensure that losses are not related to either the exposure or the outcome.</P>
