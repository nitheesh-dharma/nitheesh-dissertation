Evidence suggests there is a 40% to 50% reduction in the amount of menstrual blood lost per menstrual cycle for participants taking TXA. Antifibrinolytic treatment was better at improving HMB loss than other medical treatments, except for the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS), a plastic device placed in the uterus which releases hormone to prevent conception.</P><P>The evidence suggests that if 10.9% of women taking placebo report an improvement in HMB, 36.3% of women taking TXA will do so.</P><P>TXA probably improves quality of life for women with HMB.</P><P>We did not find any evidence that side effects (including life-threatening blood clots) were increased in women taking antifibrinolytic treatment compared to placebo or other treatments for HMB. Two studies measured venous thromboembolic events: unfortunately these studies did not have enough participants to distinguish a real effect of a certain size from pure luck.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The evidence was of very low to moderate quality. The main limitations were: risk of bias, due to participants/investigators being aware of which medication they were receiving (known as lack of blinding), or the study's methods not being reported very clearly; imprecision (i.e. repeated measurements being far apart from each other), and inconsistency (i.e. as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes increasingly wide around the true parameter value).</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-29 15:55:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-29 15:55:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels"><P>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important physical and social problem for women.

Whilst this objective cut-off has been broadly utilized in clinical trials, such measurement (involving extracting haemoglobin from sanitary wear) is impractical outside research settings. Also, this objectively measured cut-off of 'heavy' menstrual bleeding may not reflect the woman's experience, nor the impact of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) on her quality of life (QoL) (<LINK REF="REF-Warner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2004</LINK>). International guidelines (such as that produced by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) base the diagnosis of HMB on women&#8217;s and clinicians&#8217; subjective perceptions of MBL, and its resultant impact (e.g. iron-deficiency anaemia, days off work).</P><P>HMB is an important cause of ill health in women: prevalence estimates range from 4% to 51%. This wide range is due to these studies being undertaken in different countries and clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). It has been estimated that HMB accounts for 5% of general practitioner consultations by women aged 30 to 49 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2000</LINK>), whilst HMB accounts for up to one-third of all gynaecological consultations (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Hemaidi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Hemaidi 2007</LINK>).</P><P>The most widely used classification system for causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive-aged women is that of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, called the PALM-COEIN system. As outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Munro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2011</LINK>, the basic classification system breaks aetiologies down into: Polyp; Adenomyosis; Leiomyoma (submucosal/other); Malignancy and hyperplasia; Coagulopathy; Ovulatory dysfunction; Endometrial; Iatrogenic; and Not yet classified. In general, the PALM aetiologies are structural, whilst the COEIN categories are non-structural.</P><P>Around 80% of women treated for heavy menstrual bleeding have no underlying uterine abnormality (i.e. would fall into the COEIN categories listed above), yet up to 60% of women referred to a gynaecologist for HMB undergo a hysterectomy within five years of referral (<LINK REF="REF-Edlund-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edlund 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2014</LINK>). HMB is the primary indication for approximately 50% of all hysterectomies (emergency plus elective) in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2000</LINK>), and 38% of all elective hysterectomies (<LINK REF="REF-Butt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butt 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Hence medical therapy, with the avoidance of potential complications of surgical management, is an attractive alternative. A wide variety of medications are available to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, but there is considerable variation in practice, and some uncertainty about the most appropriate first line therapy: a universally applicable step-wise approach is sorely lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marret-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marret 2010</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-14 08:01:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexanocarboxylic acid (or tranexamic acid and its precursors) is an antifibrinolytic medication. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been used to treat HMB for over four decades in many European countries; in the UK, TXA is prescribed as first- or second-line medical management of HMB for over 64% of women not requiring contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2000</LINK>). In the US, TXA was not approved for the treatment of menorrhagia until 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2010</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-03-14 08:03:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Women with HMB have been found to have increased fibrinolytic activity in their menstrual fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Edlund-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edlund 2003</LINK>).</P><P>TXA exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by reversibly blocking lysine-binding sites on plasminogen, thus preventing plasmin from interacting with lysine residues on the fibrin polymer. By preventing plasmin and lysine residues from interacting, TXA thus slows subsequent fibrin degradation, thereby slowing the dissolution of clots. Antifibrinolytic agents have, therefore, been promoted as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-14 08:14:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is growing evidence of the utility of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS) in managing heavy menstrual bleeding. Qiu et al published a systematic analysis comparing the levonorgestrel intrauterine device to medical management of HMB, and included <LINK REF="REF-Gupta--2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2013</LINK>, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which compared LIUS to medical management of HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta--2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2014</LINK>). The authors concluded that LIUS is more effective for the treatment of HMB compared with oral medical treatment. However, for women for whom an intrauterine device is contra-indicated or who wish to avoid an LIUS, antifibrinolytic treatment still plays an important role.</P><P>Although TXA has been credited with reducing MBL by up to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Leminen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leminen 2012</LINK>), one study based in Somerset (UK) found that less than 15% of women presenting to their general practitioner complaining of HMB were offered antifibrinolytic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2000</LINK>). Recent data indicate that prescribing patterns may be changing: a randomized controlled trial carried out in general practices in East Anglia (in the UK) indicated rates of antifibrinolytic use among women with heavy menstrual bleeding were 57% among those practices given a specific evidence-based education package, and 35% among control practices (<LINK REF="REF-Fender-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fender 1999</LINK>).</P><P>As these medications slow the breakdown of clots, there has been anecdotal concern that antifibrinolytic agents may be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as deep venous thrombosis).

For continuous data (e.g. MBL in mL), if all studies report exactly the same outcomes we calculated mean difference (MDs) between treatment groups. If similar outcomes are reported on different scales we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD). We reversed the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We treated ordinal data (e.g. quality of life scores) as continuous data. We presented 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. Where data to calculate ORs or MDs are not available, we utilized the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of included studies (e.g. test statistics, P values). We assessed whether the estimates calculated in the review for individual studies are compatible in each case with the estimates reported in the study publications.</P><P>We included either end score or change score data for measuring MBL. Where studies report both, we used end scores. For the primary outcome, we considered whether the data underlying the published result were likely to be skewed by examining the ratio of each group mean to its standard deviation. Where end scores were reported, a ratio considerably less than two indicates positive skewness, due to the fact that 'menstrual bleeding' cannot take values less than zero. Where this was deemed to be the case, we reported the results in an additional table, as they could not be pooled in the meta-analysis without access to the raw underlying data. Where no standard deviations were reported, we took a corresponding value reported in another similar study.</P><P>Where studies reported standard deviations that were implausibly small, we assumed that these were in fact standard errors, and converted them to standard deviations, using standard methods (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></EFFECT_MEASURES><UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 09:29:50 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The primary analysis was per woman randomized.

Bryant-Smith"><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-26 20:55:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Alison C. Bryant-Smith"><P>This Cochrane review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic medications (tranexamic acid and its alternatives, such as pro-drug Kabi) in the medical management of heavy menstrual bleeding. Four studies compared TXA or Kabi to placebo, and six compared TXA to progestogens. There were few studies for the other comparisons: two compared TXA to NSAIDs (mefenamic acid), one compared TXA to ethamsylate, two to different herbal remedies, and one to levonorgestrel IUS (LIUS). Hence, there is insufficient evidence for these latter comparisons.</P><P>No studies were found that compared antifibrinolytic treatment to the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP).</P><P>On the available evidence, antifibrinolytics appear to be more effective than placebo, short courses of luteal phase oral progestogens, NSAIDs, ethamsylate or herbal remedies in reducing HMB . There is a 40% to 50% reduction from baseline in MBL for participants treated with tranexamic acid. There is a 25% to 50% reduction from baseline in measured MBL for participants treated with tranexamic acid when compared to other medical therapies.</P><P>If response to treatment is defined by reduction of MBL to less than 80 mL per cycle, 56% (14/25) of women had their menstrual cycles reduced to below 80 mL per cycle in the only study that provided this information (<LINK REF="STD-Preston-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 1995</LINK>).</P><P>Antifibrinolytic treatment is more effective than NET (when NET was given during the luteal phase only), but was of similar efficacy when the NET was given throughout the menstrual cycle (i.e. from day 5). There was no evidence of a reduction in MBL with antifibrinolytic treatment, compared to long-course MPA (when judged by PBAC), but there was when it was compared to three months' treatment with Safoof Habis.</P><P>Antifibrinolytic treatment reduces HMB in studies where blood loss has been measured, and in studies using self-reported HMB compared to oral luteal phase progestogens. Antifibrinolytic treatment was not more effective in reducing HMB as reported by the patient compared to placebo, NSAIDs or ethamsylate, although results almost reached statistical significance. There is a strong trend in favour of tranexamic acid and, with additional trials, a difference may be reported.</P><P>Antifibrinolytic therapy was not associated with reduced MBL compared to luteal phase progestogens. However, antifibrinolytic therapy was associated with a greater improvement in HMB (as perceived by the participants), compared to luteal phase progestogens. The reasons behind this apparent discrepancy could be that women's own perception of their MBL is not particularly well correlated with the actual objective volume of blood lost. <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2016</LINK> recognises that, in practical terms, it is women's subjective perception of their MBL that takes precedence over objective, laboratory-based measures such as the alkaline haematin test.</P><P>LIUS showed a reduction in mean blood loss compared to antifibrinolytic treatment.</P><P>The impact of antifibrinolytic treatment on quality of life has been compared with placebo and oral progestogen therapy. Compared to placebo, antifibrinolytic treatment was associated with an improvement in quality of life.</P><P>Antifibrinolytic treatment improved quality of life in women with HMB more effectively than oral luteal phase progestogens: antifibrinolytic treatment was more effective in reducing flooding/leakage, and improving sex life. There were no differences between antifibrinolytic treatment and oral luteal phase progestogens in general health, abdominal pain, or social activities in women with HMB. <LINK REF="STD-Goshtasebi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goshtasebi 2013</LINK> was the only trial to use the SF-36 tool to assess quality of life: there was no difference between the antifibrinolytic treatment and MPA groups in regard to quality of life.</P><P>Apart from four larger studies &#8212; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jaisamrarn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jaisamrarn 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lukes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lukes 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2008</LINK> &#8212; the number of women in the other eight trials was small (&lt; 100 participants). There are some limitations to this evidence: the results are based on very small numbers of participants for all comparisons, and the data for some comparisons are heavily skewed.</P><P>Women using antifibrinolytics for HMB are likely to be using this treatment long term; any adverse events affecting adherence or safety are particularly important. With respect to the safety of tranexamic acid and alternative medical management of HMB, only five of the included studies reported adverse effects in both treatment groups. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups, but data were too scanty to reach any reliable conclusions about safety.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2011</LINK> did not find any thrombotic or thromboembolic adverse effects in either the placebo or antifibrinolytic treatment group. One participant from the placebo group in <LINK REF="STD-Lukes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lukes 2010</LINK> had a deep venous thrombosis during the trial; no thrombotic events were reported in their antifibrinolytic treatment group. Neither of these trials was powered to detect this outcome.</P><P>It was outside the scope of this review's search strategy to collate cohort and case-controlled studies which might have clarified this point. A noticeable limitation of this review is the short period of treatment in the included trials (mostly three months).</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-03-15 18:41:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels"><P>This Cochrane review included 13 studies with data that were relevant to this review question.</P><P>The participants in these studies were all women who reported heavy menstrual bleeding. This was objectively confirmed using the alkaline haematin method in five studies, and the PBAC in seven studies. In clinical practice, the patient-perceived HMB may be more practicable in judging which women have troublesome HMB requiring treatment than either the alkaline haematin method or PBAC.</P><P>Participants in the studies included women aged 15 to 50 years old, with measured or self-reported ovulatory heavy menstrual bleeding. Hence, the conclusions drawn from these studies may not be representative of women with anovulatory HMB (i.e. during adolescence or around the menopause; or HMB due to conditions associated with anovulation, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome). Therefore, the results of this Cochrane review should be viewed with caution when attempting to extrapolate its conclusions to such patient groups.</P><P>Where MBL was measured, most studies only included women with MBL of more than 80 mL per cycle. However, 50% of women who self-report HMB do not have a measured MBL of more than 80 mL. Hence it is unclear whether studies that only included women with MBL of more than 80 mL are relevant for the management of women in clinical practice which relies on self-reported HMB. Of the studies that used self-reported MBL, <LINK REF="STD-Callender-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Callender 1970</LINK> reported a 37% decrease in MBL with antifibrinolytic treatment compared to placebo; <LINK REF="STD-Bonnar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bonnar 1996</LINK> reported that antifibrinolytic treatment reduced MBL by 54% compared to no treatment; <LINK REF="STD-Edlund-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Edlund 1995</LINK> reported a 33% reduction in MBL with Kabi QDS, and 41% reduction with Kabi BD, both compared to placebo; <LINK REF="STD-Fathima-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fathima 2012</LINK> reported that antifibrinolytic treatment and Safoof Habis were equally effective in reducing MBL &#8212; the PBAC score in the antifibrinolytic treatment group improved from 162.37 at baseline to 75.3 over the course of three cycles; and <LINK REF="STD-Preston-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 1995</LINK> reported that antifibrinolytic treatment reduced MBL by 45%.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:23:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The methodological quality of the evidence varied from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with lack of blinding, and poor reporting of study methods), imprecision and inconsistency.

In addition, where studies were not blinded and PBAC was used to measure the primary bleeding outcome or adverse events were experienced, the participants' knowledge of their treatment was likely to have influenced their assessment of their bleeding and adverse events. Hence, these findings should be considered tentative. No outcome results were supported by high-quality evidence. A few had moderate-quality evidence, but most had either low-quality or very low quality evidence.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:26:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We attempted to identify and include all relevant studies through the standardized method of identifying studies, but it is possible we may have missed some studies.

The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline regarding management of HMB recommends the following medical managements, in order of preference, for women with no suspected structural/histological abnormalities underlying their HMB: levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS); TXA, NSAIDs or COCP; NET (days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle); or injected long-acting progestogens (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2016</LINK>).</P><P>The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SCOG) outlines the following medical treatments for HMB: non-hormonal (NSAIDs, antifibrinolytic treatment); and hormonal (COCP, levonorgestrel intrauterine system, oral progestins, Depot-MPA, danazol, and GnRH-agonists). Unfortunately they do not provide any clear guidance as to which is preferable, other than broad statements recommending that patients' contraceptive needs and medical co-morbidities should be taken into account (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2013</LINK>). Hence our findings support current recommendations from both NICE and SCOG regarding the efficacy of antifibrinolytic treatment in managing HMB.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Lumsden-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumsden 2011</LINK> is a succinct review of the use of TXA in HMB in clinical practice. The authors conclude that TXA is particularly useful for the management of HMB in women who either desire pregnancy immediately or for whom hormonal treatment is inappropriate. They describe TXA as being a well-tolerated and cost-effective drug that reduces MBL by 34% to 59%, whilst improving health-related quality of life in women with HMB.</P><P>A previous systematic review investigated the efficacy of tranexamic acid in treating heavy menstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Naoulou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naoulou 2012</LINK>). In line with this current review, the authors concluded that tranexamic acid is effective and safe in management HMB: their results showed a 34% to 54% reduction in either self-reported or measured MBL with antifibrinolytic treatment.</P><P>Another systematic review compared RCTs of non-surgical management of HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Matteson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matteson 2013</LINK>), which was presumed to be secondary to endometrial dysfunction and anovulation. The non-surgical methods in the comparison included: the LIUS, combined OCP, progestins, NSAIDs, and anti-fibrinolytics. The authors concluded that these management options' efficacies (listed from most to least efficacious) were: LIUS (71% to 95% reduction in menstrual bleeding); COCP (35% to 69% reduction); extended cycle oral progestogens (87% reduction); TXA (26% to 54% reduction); NSAIDs (10% to 52% reduction). Of note: progestins used only during the luteal phase (e.g. days 15 to 26) showed a 20% increase to 67% reduction in menstrual bleeding. Our review has found antifibrinolytic treatment's efficacy to be at the higher end of their range.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Gupta--2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2013</LINK> performed a pragmatic randomized trial, comparing LIUS with 'usual medical treatment', including tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, COCP and progesterone-only pills. Whilst all groups showed evidence of a reduction in MBL, the improvement in self-reported MBL was greater in the LIUS group.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:34:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:33:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Evidence suggests that antifibrinolytic treatment (such as TXA) is effective treatment with women of reproductive age with heavy menstrual bleeding: it is associated with a reduction in measured heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with placebo, NSAIDS, oral luteal progestogens, ethamsylate, or herbal remedies. On the other hand, LIUS showed a reduction in median PBAC scores compared to TXA. For some of these comparisons, differences between treatments were not always perceived by the women in the trials. These findings are based on small trials with variable quality.</P><P>Oral administration of antifibrinolytic therapy (such as TXA) does not seem to be associated with any increase in major adverse events. Most studies did not include VTE as an end-point; studies that did measure VTE have not shown any increase in risk with antifibrinolytic treatment, but were underpowered for this outcome. Hence, there was insufficient evidence to assess thromboembolism risk with antifibrinolytic treatment.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:34:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>More information is needed on the comparative efficacy of antifibrinolytic treatment, compared to other medical therapies such as the combined oral contraceptive pill, LIUS, and progestogens taken for 21 days (or more) of the menstrual cycle. Future trial design needs to include such outcomes as participant satisfaction, cost-effectiveness data, quality-of-life measures, and a longer duration of treatment (at least six months) to assess adverse events. Trials powered to detect any increased risk in VTE would be very helpful, but may require a prohibitively large number of patients to be enrolled. More information is needed on the efficacy of antifibrinolytic treatment in the treatment of self-reported HMB.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-14 11:35:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We are grateful to the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group for its support, especially Marian Showell (Information Specialist), Jane Marjoribanks (Assistant Managing Editor), and Helen Nagels (Managing Editor).</P><P>We thank those pharmaceutical companies (Pharmacia, Upjohn and Lorex Synthelabo) who gave extra unpublished data; and those authors who also provided unpublished data and answered queries (<LINK REF="STD-Bonnar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bonnar 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edlund-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Edlund 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaisamrarn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jaisamrarn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiseli-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kiseli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kouides-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kouides 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lukes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preston-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01428713" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01428713</LINK>).</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-03-29 15:09:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>AB-S, AL and CF have no conflicts of interest to declare.

The title is accurate, but would be more informative if it mentioned tranexamic acid. One of the included trials tested another fibrinolytic, and that was a pro-drug of tranexamic acid.</P><P>2. I would like to know more about the adverse effects reported in the trials. The review suggests that they were insignificant, but I suspect that this means statistically insignificant in the individual trials. Whether any of them were clinically significant is not clear, except that they did not apparently lead any woman to stop using the drug. But did they lead to a reduction in dose? How many women reported nausea, diarrhoea or vomiting, the three side-effects mentioned in the British National Formulary? Were these separated in the trial reports, or were they always lumped together as gastrointestinal effects, as in the review?</P><P>3. The objectives excluded "iatrogenic menorrhagia" eg induced by an intra-uterine device. I suggest that these be included in the next revision of the review, because the problem is a closely related one that does not seem to deserve a separate review on its own."</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-11-11 01:51:11 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Alison C. Bryant-Smith"><P>1. The systematic review looked at the effects of antifibrinolytic agents on menorrhagia since there is a common mode of action with these agents (see background). It would not be appropriate to limit the review to tranexamic acid alone even though this is the drug invariably used. By leaving the title broad enough, this leaves open the chance to include other agents with a similar mode of action that may be developed in the future.</P><P>2. I have included the other types of side effects in this update of the review. Even though there were no statistically significant differences, I acknowledge that there still could be clinically significant differences which are of relevance. However, none of the trials looked at these outcomes so no comment can be made. There were no differences in withdrawal rates from the trials.</P><P>3. The review excluded trials of women with intra-uterine devices who reported heavy menstrual bleeding for 2 reasons. Firstly, women with IUSs fitted who find their bleeding intolerable will usually be advised to try another means of contraception. Secondly, an IUS, the levonorgestrel releasing IUS, has recently been developed which acts both as a contraceptive device and is also recommended as an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2017-12-02 14:47:38 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Andrew Herxheimer, February 1999</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM></FEEDBACK><APPENDICES MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><APPENDIX ID="APP-01" MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="1"><TITLE MODIFIED="2016-03-16 09:48:49 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility specialised register search</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Searched 7 November 2017</P><P>PROCITE platform</P><P>Keywords CONTAINS "menorrhagia" or "menorrhagia-outcome" or "Menorrhagia-Symptoms" or "heavy bleeding" or "heavy menstrual bleeding" or "heavy menstrual loss" or "dysfunctional uterine bleeding" or Title CONTAINS "menorrhagia" or "menorrhagia-outcome" or "Menorrhagia-Symptoms" or "heavy bleeding" or "heavy menstrual bleeding" or "heavy menstrual loss" or "dysfunctional uterine bleeding" "</P><P>AND</P><P>Keywords CONTAINS "antifibrinolytics" or "tranexamic acid" or "KABI 2161" or Title CONTAINS "antifibrinolytics" or "tranexamic acid" or "KABI 2161"</P><P>(58 hits)</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-02" MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="2"><TITLE MODIFIED="2016-03-16 09:59:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">CENTRAL CRSO search strategy</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Searched 7 November 2017</P><P>CRS Online web platform</P><P>#1MESH DESCRIPTOR Menorrhagia EXPLODE ALL TREES 277<BR/>#2Menorrhagia:TI,AB,KY 630<BR/>#3hypermenorrhea:TI,AB,KY 17<BR/>#4(heavy menstru*):TI,AB,KY 181<BR/>#5(heavy period*):TI,AB,KY 5<BR/>#6(dysfunctional uter* bleeding):TI,AB,KY 124<BR/>#7#1 OR #2 OR #3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6 787<BR/>#8MESH DESCRIPTOR Antifibrinolytic Agents EXPLODE ALL TREES 1116<BR/>#9MESH DESCRIPTOR Tranexamic Acid EXPLODE ALL TREES 495<BR/>#10antifibrinolytic*:TI,AB,KY 804<BR/>#11(tranexamic acid):TI,AB,KY 1330<BR/>#12kabi:TI,AB,KY 151<BR/>#13#8 OR #9 OR #10 OR #11 OR #12 2211<BR/>#14#7 AND #13 78</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-03" MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="3"><TITLE MODIFIED="2016-03-16 09:59:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">MEDLINE search strategy</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:29:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Searched from 1946 to 7 November 2017</P><P>OVID platform</P><P>1 exp Menorrhagia/ (4251)<BR/>2 hypermenorrhea.tw.
