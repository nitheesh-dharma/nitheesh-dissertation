<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Limited data supports use of urinary alkalinisation for the treatment of acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Acute poisoning with chlorophenoxy herbicides such as 2,4-D and MCPA is reported world wide, potentially causing severe toxicity and death. Since there is no antidote for chlorophenoxy herbicides, treatments such as urinary alkalinisation have been used to increase the clearance of these poisons from the body. Although urinary alkalinisation was first trialled over 30 years ago, it is not currently used routinely for the treatment of patients with acute chlorophenoxy poisoning. This review looked for studies where this treatment had been given to poisoned patients. No studies of sufficient quality were identified and therefore routine use of this approach to treatment cannot be recommended. However, due to the poor outcomes in patients who present with severe toxicity it may have a role in addition to standard intensive care support. More research should be conducted.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute poisoning with chlorophenoxy herbicides (such as 2,4-D, MCPA, 2,4,5-T and mecoprop) is reported worldwide, potentially causing severe toxicity and death in exposed patients. Animal studies support the application of urinary alkalinisation (particularly using sodium bicarbonate) in the management of acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning to facilitate excretion of these herbicides. Some case reports of human exposure have suggested benefit from urinary alkalinisation also. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of urinary alkalinisation, in particular sodium bicarbonate, for the treatment of acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, http://www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. The bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed and experts in the field were contacted. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of urinary alkalinisation in patients ingesting a chlorophenoxy herbicide and presenting within 24 to 48 hours of poisoning were sought. The quality of studies and eligibility for inclusion was assessed using criteria by Jadad and Schulz.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Authors independently extracted data from the identified studies using a pre-designed form. Study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes were all recorded. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies were identified which satisfied inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of urinary alkalinisation for acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning. A well conducted randomised controlled trial is urgently required to determine whether the efficacy and indications of this treatment.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 22:50:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chlorophenoxy compounds are selective herbicides with agricultural and domestic uses. A number of compounds are included in this group, most notably 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and mecoprop (MCPP).</P>
<P>Severe toxicity (including coma, rhabdomyolysis and renal toxicity) and death from acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning has been reported worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Bradberry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradberry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). The incidence of severe toxicity and case-fatality ratio for acute chlorophenoxy herbicide self-poisoning is not well studied. A mortality of up to 33% has been noted from case reports and small case series of predominantly 2,4-D poisonings (69 patients in total) (<LINK REF="REF-Bradberry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradberry 2004</LINK>). A recent series of 181 consecutive patients with acute MCPA poisoning reported a lower, yet still significant, mortality of 4.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). Whether outcomes differ between individual chlorophenoxy compounds has not been defined.</P>
<P>In the absence of a specific antidote for chlorophenoxy herbicides, the management of acute poisoning consists largely of appropriate decontamination, supportive measures and symptomatic care (<LINK REF="REF-Bradberry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradberry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). Intravenous fluids to rehydrate the patient and ensure an adequate urine output would be part of supportive care in most patients (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>For urinary alkalinisation to be effective, the compound must be largely filtered by the kidneys, of which a significant proportion is reabsorbed in the distal tubule of the nephron. The proposed mechanism by which urinary alkalinisation enhances elimination is that the high pH (&gt;7.5) traps the chlorophenoxy herbicide in the urinary filtrate (termed 'ion trapping'), decreasing the amount that is passively reabsorbed from the nephron and increasing urinary clearance. Similarly, an increase in urinary flow will dilute the concentration of chlorophenoxy herbicide in the filtrate which decreases the rate of passive reabsorption (often termed 'forced diuresis') (<LINK REF="REF-Proudfoot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proudfoot 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Animal studies support the application of urinary alkalinisation to enhance the elimination of chlorophenoxy herbicides (<LINK REF="REF-Braunlich-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braunlich 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1976</LINK>). Some case reports suggest benefits from urinary alkalinisation in acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning (<LINK REF="STD-Flanagan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flanagan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friesen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friesen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmoldt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmoldt 1997</LINK>), and standard clinical toxicology textbooks, expert reviews and a recent consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-Proudfoot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proudfoot 2004</LINK>) also recommend urinary alkalinisation for patients with severe poisoning. Despite this, it appears that urinary alkalinisation is not widely used in countries where acute poisonings with chlorophenoxy herbicides occur more commonly, such as Sri Lanka and India (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Sodium bicarbonate is the most commonly recommended agent for inducing urinary alkalinisation, perhaps because it is cheap, widely available and stable in climatic extremes.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 22:46:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning may be associated with severe toxicity and death. In the absence of a specific antidote, urinary alkalinisation was first trialled as a treatment for these poisonings over 30 years ago. Since that time there have been a limited number of studies conducted to measure the effect of urinary alkalinisation in humans. In particular, there have been no well conducted randomised controlled trials to provide adequate evidence of effect. However, a number of papers were identified where urinary alkalinisation was administered to patients with acute chlorophenoxy poisoning which are worthy of some discussion, although it should be emphasised that the aim was not to systematically review these study types.</P>
<P>An uncontrolled prospective case series of 41 patients with acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning (16 of whom received 'alkaline diuresis', regimen not stated) was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Flanagan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flanagan 1990</LINK>). This paper suggested that alkaline diuresis increased the clearance of chlorophenoxy herbicides on the basis of a decrease in the plasma elimination half-life (from between ~80 and 120 hours to &lt;30 hours). Similarily, in three other patients who were treated with urinary alkalinisation/diuresis there was a decrease in the chlorophenoxy plasma/serum elimination half-life (from between ~40 and 130 hours to three and 13 hours), leading the authors to also conclude that the treatment increased clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Friesen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friesen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmoldt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmoldt 1997</LINK>). But closer review of data in these publications, where available, did not show a close temporal relationship between the plasma/serum concentration-time profile, urine flow and urine pH.</P>
<P>Inspection of the pharmacokinetic profiles reported in these cases raises other questions regarding the effect of urinary alkalinisation/diuresis. The overall shape of the semi-logarithmic plasma/serum concentration-time graphs is generally convex, and in most cases there is a noticable change from a relatively long to shorter elimination half-life at around 150 to 300mg/L (<LINK REF="STD-Flanagan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flanagan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friesen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friesen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmoldt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmoldt 1997</LINK>). But similarly shaped plasma concentration-time curves with an inflection point at approximately the same concentration have been noted in patients with acute MCPA poisoning, none of whom were treated with urinary alkalinisation/diuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2004</LINK>). The latter observation questions whether the pharmacokinetic profile observed in patients who received urinary alkalinisation/diuresis was a result of the treatment.</P>
<P>Rat studies have noted that with increasing doses of MCPA in the absence of urinary alkalinisation/diuresis, the plasma concentration-time profile changed from log-linear to a non-linear convex-shaped graph. Similarily, an apparent inflection point was noted at ~200mg/L (<LINK REF="REF-Elo-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elo 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elo-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elo 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Ravenzwaay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Ravenzwaay 2004</LINK>). <I>In vitro</I> studies in rats reported saturation of protein binding at the same concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Braunlich-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braunlich 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elo-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elo 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyynel_x00e4_-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyynelä 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ylitalo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ylitalo 1990</LINK>), and saturation of renal clearance has also been reported in animals administered chlorphenoxy herbicides (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Ravenzwaay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Ravenzwaay 2004</LINK>). Saturation of protein binding and/or saturable clearance produce non-linear kinetics which are characterised by a similar convex-shaped profile on semi-logarithmic graphs of the concentration-time data (<LINK REF="REF-_x00d8_ie-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Øie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowland-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 1989</LINK>). Non-linear kinetics such as these create difficulty when trying to calculate the volume of distribution and clearance (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1979</LINK>) because as the concentration increases, the volume of distribution increases and clearance becomes a zero-order process (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 1989</LINK>). If saturation of protein binding and/or clearance are the cause of the convex log-concentration-time profile, then previous studies which concluded that urinary alkalinisation increased total clearance on the basis of this plasma/serum data may have erred. This again highlights the importance of controlled studies and the need for more data, particularly mechanistic data which confirms that there is significant urinary clearance with alkalinisation/diuresis relative to systemic clearance.</P>
<P>Two pharmacokinetic studies have suggested a relationship between urine pH and urinary chlorophenoxy clearance in humans (<LINK REF="STD-Flanagan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Flanagan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1979</LINK>). These studies reported that an increase in urine pH was associated with an increase in urinary clearance of chlorophenoxy herbicides, consistent with the ion trapping mechanism discused above. For one of these studies, renal 2,4-D clearance increased from 5.1mL/min to 63mL/min as pH increased from five to eight (<LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1979</LINK>). The estimated total clearance in volunteers is calculated to be ~30mL/min or less with significant interpatient variation (<LINK REF="REF-Kohli-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohli 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sauerhoff-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauerhoff 1977</LINK>), so the urinary clearance achieved with alkalinisation in this patient appears significant.</P>
<P>Given the lack of randomised controlled trials, the overall effect of urinary alkalinisation is unknown. A randomised controlled trial to assess whether there is clinical benefit is required. Prior to this it may be useful to conduct studies that confirm there is a mechanistic effect. Specifically, the following is required:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Renal clearance must be calculated from the urine volume and the urine and plasma concentrations. The analytical method must be able to differentiate between conjugated metabolites and the parent compound given that both are known to be excreted in the urine (<LINK REF="REF-Bradberry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradberry 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>An estimate of the change in clearance with urinary alkalinisation will require a comparison of the rate of elimination between treated and untreated patients with similar plasma concentrations given the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics.</LI>
<LI>Dose-response data to determine the regimen which maximises clearance of the chlorophenoxy herbicide and minimises the occurence of potential adverse effects. In particular, a regimen which rapidly induces urinary alkalinisation in these cases of poisoning should be determined given that many of the previous studies have reported significant delays (&gt;48 hours in a number of cases) until urinary alkalinisation (pH &gt; 7.5) was achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Proudfoot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proudfoot 2004</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Urinary alkalinisation may be effective for the treatment of acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning, but data regarding the indication, regimen and efficacy are lacking. All patients should receive routine resuscitation and supportive care. It seems reasonable to correct acidosis and maintain an adequate urine output, but there is insufficient evidence to support other specific interventions in routine management (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). However, it is not unreasonable to attempt urinary alkalinisation in these patients using a dosing regimen similar to that described for aspirin (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Proudfoot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proudfoot 2004</LINK>) given that toxicity may be prolonged and result in death after 24 hours, few significant adverse effects have been reported from urinary alkalinisation, and the potential for this treatment to provide some benefit.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Well conducted randomised controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of urinary alkalinisation in acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning. Pharmacokinetic data should also be collected to provide mechanistic data to support the outcomes of clinical studies.</P>
