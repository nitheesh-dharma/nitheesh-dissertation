<P>Pulmonary disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in term and near term infants.

<P>Standard search methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group were used.

</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing HFOV and CV in term or near term infants with intractable respiratory failure were included in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-12 05:04:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. The investigators separately extracted, assessed and coded all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Data were synthesized using risk ratio [RR with (95% confidence intervals, CI)] and mean difference (with standard deviation, SD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 12:20:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One trial involving the "elective" use of HFOV randomized 118 infants at the start of CV. The other trial of "rescue" HFOV randomized 81 infants with later respiratory failure on CV. Neither trial showed evidence of a reduction in mortality at 28 days or in failed therapy on the assigned mode of ventilation requiring cross-over to the other mode. Neither study reported significant differences in the risk of pulmonary air leak, chronic lung disease (28 days or more in oxygen) or intracranial injury. In the study of elective HFOV, there was no difference noted in days on a ventilator or days in hospital. In the one rescue study, there was no difference in the risk of needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-12-19 04:44:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no data from randomized controlled trials supporting the use of rescue HFOV in term or near term infants with severe pulmonary dysfunction. The area is complicated by diverse pathology in such infants and by the occurrence of other interventions (surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, inotropes). Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the role of elective or rescue HFOV in near term and term infants with pulmonary dysfunction before widespread use of this mode of ventilation in such infants.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-21 16:50:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-12 12:06:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulmonary disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in term and near term newborn infants (35 or more weeks of gestation at birth). The most frequent serious pulmonary disorders are meconium aspiration, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), persistent pulmonary hypertension and diaphragmatic hernia.</P>
<P>Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) is used for severe respiratory failure in about 0.3% of term infants. Conventional ventilation (CV) is administered with a time-cycled pressure-limited or volume-targeted ventilator providing rates usually in the range of 30 - 80 breaths per minute. This form of IPPV, together with exposure to high toxic levels of oxygen, is thought to lead to lung injury and pulmonary morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000a</LINK>). In some infants, CV fails to maintain adequate gas exchange and they either die or are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a more invasive treatment.</P>
<P>Observational studies have suggested that high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is an effective method of providing pulmonary gas exchange in animals with severe pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Truog-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truog 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-deLemos-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">deLemos 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerstmann-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerstmann 1988</LINK>) and may also reduce the severity of lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation. HFOV involves provision of an oscillatory wave form at about 10 Hz, where mean airway pressure determines lung volume leading to oxygen transfer and the amplitude of oscillation determines carbon dioxide exchange. The waveform is generated by specialized piston oscillators, flow interrupters or diaphragms.</P>
<P>HFOV has been used for the mechanical ventilation of preterm infants born at less than 35 weeks gestation who have respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It has been used electively from the onset of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2007</LINK>) or as rescue therapy when conventional ventilation fails (<LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uncontrolled rescue studies in term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kohlet-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohlet 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1990</LINK>) indicate that HFOV might be of value in neonates with intractable respiratory failure who are candidates for ECMO. In the case series of Carter et al (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1990</LINK>) fifty term or near term infants were admitted for ECMO. All infants had a PAO2-PaO2 gradient greater than or equal to 600 mmHg in spite of aggressive conventional ventilatory and pharmacological therapy. All patients were offered HFOV and, if no improvement occurred, were treated with ECMO. Forty-six of the patients were treated with a staged protocol using HFOV before ECMO. Twenty-one of these 46 (46%) responded to HFOV treatment alone and did not require ECMO therapy. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes with respect to number of ventilator days, hospital days, or survival between patients responding to HFOV and patients who received ECMO. However, morbidity was increased in ECMO patients. Bleeding abnormalities, seizures, and renal failure occurred more frequently than in HFOV treated infants.</P>
<P>This review examines the results of randomized controlled trials of elective and rescue HFOV versus CV in term or near term infants with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.</P>

<P>Two eligible trials were found (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Elective HFOV</B>
</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2005</LINK> trial included infants (118) born at greater than 35 weeks gestational age and with birth weight of 1750 grams or more. They were 4 - 48 hrs of age and had respiratory failure (requiring 60% or more oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90% and PaO<SUB>2</SUB> 60 mmHg or more) with intent to introduce mechanical ventilation. They were briefly started initially on CV with a mean airway pressure of 9 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O and average inspired oxygen of 80% and were expected to require more than 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. Randomization was done at less than 8hrs of CV to elective use of HFOV compared with continued CV.</P>
<P>Interventions included HFOV - Sensormedics ventilators - using mean airway pressure 2 cm H2O above that on CV before enrolment, inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 0.33, rate 10 Hz and the main method to improve oxygenation was to increase the mean airway pressure. Hypoxemia on CV was adjusted by modifying FiO<SUB>2</SUB> when this was less than 0.40 or modifying peak and/or end expiratory pressure when FiO<SUB>2</SUB> was greater than 0.40. Carbon dioxide levels were modified by changing the peak inspiratory pressure or ventilator rate (not more than 80 breaths per minute).</P>
<P>
<B>Rescue HFOV</B>
</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> trial recruited patients between 1990 - 92. Neonates were eligible for the rescue study if their estimated gestational age was greater than 34 weeks, their birth weight was equal to or greater than 2 kg, they were less than 14 days of age and, on conventional mechanical ventilation, their FiO<SUB>2</SUB> requirements were greater than 0.5, mean airway pressure was greater than 10cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, peak inspiratory pressure greater than 30 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O and respiratory rate greater than 40/min.</P>
<P>If the partial pressure of oxygen was less than 35 mm Hg on three arterial blood gas studies, or if the infants presented in profound shock or needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, they were eligible for immediate ECMO and were excluded from enrolment on that basis. Eighty one patients were randomized to HFOV or CV. Twenty-two per cent of the patients had received surfactant prior to trial entry.</P>
<P>HFOV was carried out with Sensormedics 3100 set at a frequency of 10 Hz, a fractional inspiratory time of 0.33 and a pressure amplitude sufficient to produce visible chest wall motion. The initial mean airway pressure was set at 1 - 2 cm higher than CV.</P>
<P>CV was provided with pressure limited, time-cycled ventilators. The target range for PCO<SUB>2</SUB> was 25 to 35 mm Hg in patients with pulmonary hypertension and in all other patients it was 45 to 55 mmHg.</P>
<P>
<I>Treatment Failure:</I> Patients who failed to respond to the assigned mode of ventilation were crossed over to the alternative mode of ventilation. The criteria for treatment failure were<BR/>1) PaO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 65 mm Hg on an FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of 1.0 for 2 hours<BR/>2) PaO<SUB>2</SUB> below the target range for 2 hours<BR/>3) air leak that was severe (more than two chest tubes) or persistent (more than 24 hours)<BR/>4) cardiac impairment on the ventilator settings required to achieve adequate gas exchange</P>
<P>
<I>ECMO criteria:</I> To be considered for ECMO the neonate had to have reversible lung disease and have no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage or coagulopathy. In addition, the neonate had to have one of the following signs of respiratory failure:<BR/>1) alveolar-arterial oxygen difference greater than 610 mmHg for eight hours<BR/>2) alveolar-arterial oxygen difference greater than 605 mmHg and peak pressure of at least 38 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O for four hours<BR/>3) oxygenation index greater than 40 on three of five post-ductal gases obtained at least 30 minutes apart<BR/>4) severe, refractory respiratory failure with sudden decompensation despite maximum medical management for two hours</P>

Two infants, one from each group were excluded after randomization because of congenital abnormalities. One had total anomalous pulmonary venous return and one had Jeune syndrome. Outcomes were assessed blinded to group assignment for head ultrasounds and diagnosis of CLD, but not for pulmonary air leaks.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-21 16:50:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials were identified that addressed the issue of HFOV compared to conventional ventilation in term or near term infants with respiratory failure. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> directed the use of the alternative treatment if prespecified failure criteria were met, thus leading to underestimation of any real treatment effects. The sample size required for this trial was 250 patients. However, due to difficulty in enrolling patients because of increasing use of HFOV by the referral centres, the trial was prematurely terminated when only 81 patients had been randomized. Thus, this trial did not have adequate power to detect significant differences in outcome.</P>
<P>Elective and rescue HFOV is also used in preterm infants to prevent death and morbidity including chronic lung disease and is the subject of others' reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998</LINK>). There is no clear evidence that elective HFOV offers important advantages over CV when used as the initial ventilation strategy to treat preterm infants with acute pulmonary dysfunction. There may be a small reduction in the rate of CLD (oxygen therapy required at 36 weeks postmenstrual age) with HFOV use, but the evidence is weakened by the inconsistency of this effect across trials and the overall borderline significance. There is insufficient information on the use of rescue HFOV to make recommendations for practice. The small amount of data that exists suggest that harm might outweigh any benefit.</P>
<P>A recent report of the ECMO Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry shows that high frequency ventilation is being commonly used before rescue treatment with ECMO (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2000</LINK>). Additionally, studies of inhaled nitric oxide have suggested that HFOV is important as a lung recruitment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000b</LINK>). There is increasing clinical use of HFOV in rescuing infants with respiratory failure.</P>
<P>However, since the early observational studies and the two randomized studies included in this review showing no significant effect on outcomes, there have been important changes in the practice of neonatal medicine including increasing use of surfactant, nitric oxide and other interventions such as inotropic agents. As described by <LINK REF="REF-Jaballah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaballah 2006</LINK> in his observational study on the background of changing practices, it is difficult to tease out confounders and so it is vitally important that randomized controlled trials be done to establish the place of HFOV in these groups of patients.</P>

The intervention for obvious reasons could not be blinded. Completeness of follow up: 2 patients were excluded after randomization. The outcomes of head ultrasound and CLD were blinded, however the air leak outcome was not blinded.</P>

<P>Eighty one infants greater than 34 weeks gestation, birthweight equal or greater than 2 kg, less than 14 days of age and requiring &gt; 0.5 FiO<SUB>2</SUB> and mean airway pressure &gt; 10 cms were eligible for the trial. Entry measures were; median age 29 days (range 2-149), similar mean FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of 0.95 in HFOV group and 0.97 in CV group, higher peak inspiratory pressure (cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, P&lt;0.05) in HFOV group (mean 39, SD 8) and CV group (mean 34, SD 5), mean airway pressure (cm H<SUB>2</SUB>0) were similar in the two groups (HFOV 17, CV 16), more already met ECMO criteria in the HFOV group (26) compared with the CV group (16) (P&lt;0.05)</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>HFOV. High volume strategy was used, thus oxygen was weaned before mean airway pressure. Frequency was set at 10Hz, pressure amplitude sufficient to produce visible chest motion. CV consisted of time cycled pressure limited IPPV with rates less than 120/min. The goal was to use the lowest possible peak pressures to avoid lung barotrauma. In patients with alkalosis-responsive pulmonary hypertension, the target partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide was 25 to 35 mm Hg. In other patients it was 45 to 55 mm Hg.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Mortality at 28 days, failed treatment requiring crossover, use of ECMO, CLD at 28 days of age, numbers of days in hospital, on ventilator and on oxygen.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Trial specified use of the alternate treatment following failure of assigned mode of ventilation. Additional information regarding the blinding of randomization and of the outcome of head ultrasound were provided by Dr RH Clark.</P>
