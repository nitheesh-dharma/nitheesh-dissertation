Although there is no evidence of a significant adverse event profile, there is also no evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit for people with Alzheimer's disease.

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people accounting for some 60% of cases with late-onset cognitive deterioration. It is now thought that several neurotransmitter dysfunctions are involved from an early stage in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease-associated cognitive decline.</P>
<P>The efficacy of selegiline for symptoms of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial and is reflected by its low rate of prescription and the lack of approval by several regulatory authorities in Europe and elsewhere. Reasons for this uncertainty involve the modest overall effects observed in some trials, the lack of benefit observed in several trials, the use of cross-over designs which harbour methodological problems in a disease like dementia and the difficulty in interpreting results from trials when a variety of measurement scales are used to assess outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess whether or not selegiline improves the well-being of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Impairment Group Register of Clinical Trials, was searched using the terms 'selegiline', 'l-deprenyl', ''eldepryl" and "monamine oxidase inhibitor-B" on 9 October 2002. This Register contains records from all major health care databases and many trials databases and is updated regularly.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized controlled trials in which treatment with selegiline was administered for more than a day and compared to placebo in patients with dementia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>An individual patient data meta-analysis of selegiline, Wilcock 2002 provides much of the data that are available for this review. Seven studies provided individual patient data and this was pooled with summary statistics from the published papers of the other nine studies. Where possible, intention-to-treat data were used but usually the meta analyses were restricted to completers' data (data on people who completed the study).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>There are 17 included trials. There were very few significant treatment effects and these were all in favour of selegiline; cognition at 4-6 weeks and 8-17 weeks, and activities of daily living at 4-6 weeks .</P>
<P>There is little evidence of adverse effects caused by selegiline, and few withdrew from trials, apart from the Sano trial. The analyses were conducted on data available. There was no attempt to correct for missing patients because there were so few and withdrawal was probably unconnected with treatment.</P>
<P>All trials examined the cognitive effects of selegiline, and in addition 12 trials examined the behavioural and mood effects.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis revealed benefits on memory function, shown by improvement in the memory tests from several cognitive tests. The combined memory tests, and overall the combined cognitive tests, analysed using standardised mean differences, showed an improvement due to selegiline compared with placebo at 4-6 weeks and 8-17 weeks.<BR/>The meta-analyses of emotional state show no treatment effects.</P>
<P>Several studies assessed activities of daily living using several different scales. The combined tests, analysed using the standardised mean difference, showed an improvement due to selegiline at 4-6 weeks.</P>
<P>The global rating scales analysed using standardised mean differences showed no effect of selegiline.</P>
<P>A variety of adverse effects were recorded, but very few patients left a trial as a direct result. The meta-analyses of the numbers suffering adverse effects, and of the numbers of withdrawals before the end of the trial show no difference between control and selegiline. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite its initial promise, i.e. the potential neuroprotective properties, and its role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease sufferers, selegiline for Alzheimer's disease has proved disappointing. Although there is no evidence of a significant adverse event profile, there is also no evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit for Alzheimer's disease sufferers. This is true irrespective of the outcome measure evaluated, i.e. cognition, emotional state, activities of daily living, and global assessment, whether in the short, or longer term (up to 69 weeks), where this has been assessed. There would seem to be no justification, therefore, to use it in the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease, nor for any further studies of its efficacy in Alzheimer's disease.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:43:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people accounting for some 60% of cases with late-onset cognitive deterioration. It is now thought that several neurotransmitter dysfunctions are involved from an early stage in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease-associated cognitive decline.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:43:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Selegiline (L-Deprenyl) is a levorotary acetylenic derivative of phenylethylamine initially developed in Hungary by Knoll for use as an anti hypertensive. Its applicability for patients with Parkinson's disease was discovered incidentally. At low dosage (10 mg/day), it is an irreversible selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor with minimal anticholinergic properties, low risk for hypertensive crisis, and has few side effects, while at higher dosage (e.g. 40 mg/day) it also inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), thus losing its specificity. Substrates for MAO-A mitochondrial enzyme include norepinephrine and serotonin and it is inactivated by clorgyline.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:44:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>MAO-B accounts for some 80% of human brain MAO, and uses dopamine and phenylethylamine as substrates. It is selectively inhibited by selegiline. Selegiline has been shown to inhibit the uptake of dopamine in the presynaptic nerve endings thus increasing its synthesis. Beside potentiating endogenous dopaminergic functions of the nigrostriatal (motor) neuronal systems affected in Parkinson's disease, selegiline may also influence mesolimbic (cognitive) neuronal systems that loop through frontocortical pathways. Fluctuations in dopaminergic activity have been shown to be associated with measurable variations in the operations of working memory while noradrenergic alterations can influence attention/concentration.</P>
<P>The potential use of selegiline in AD as a neuroprotective agent was originally surmised following reports of elevated MAO-B activity, compared to healthy older people, in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) probably in direct relation to increased proportion of glial cells. Moreover, the highest concentration of this deaminating compound is often found in the hippocampus, a pivotal structure in the anatomical pathology of AD. Because it is thought that monoamines play a central role in cognitive processes which are disturbed in AD, the pharmacological use of selegiline in inhibiting monoamine oxidation may come to enhance memory functions normally mediated by catecholamine systems in these patients.</P>
<P>The efficacy of selegiline for symptoms of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial and is reflected by its low rate of prescription (for a common disease which affects well over 2% of people over the age of 65) and the lack of approval by several regulatory authorities in Europe and elsewhere. Reasons for this uncertainty involve the modest overall effects observed in some trials, the lack of benefit observed in several trials, the use of cross-over designs which harbour methodological problems in a disease like dementia and the difficulty in interpreting results from trials when a variety of measurement scales are used to assess outcome.</P>
<P/>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:44:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Many of the individual trials of selegiline may have been too small to provide precise estimates of moderate benefits. However, combining the information from all trials of this intervention may provide a better estimate of the likely effects of treatment.</P>
<P>No formal statistical overview of the efficacy of selegiline had been conducted in the past because the data provided in publications are difficult to combine. In particular, different studies have used different scales to measure efficacy. Recent advances in statistical methodology in this area now allow such an overview to be performed.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess whether or not selegiline improves the well-being of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All unconfounded, randomized trials of patients with Alzheimer's disease in which treatment with selegiline was administered for more than a day and compared to a control group were studied. Trials in which the allocation to treatment or control was not randomized, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed were excluded. This is because prior knowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased patient allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All studies in which patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were treated with selegiline were included in the review. Patients diagnosed with accepted criteria such as ICD, DSM (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) and NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>) were included.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Selegiline given at any dose for more than one day with parallel concomitant placebo control.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was searched on 9 October 2002 using the terms 'selegiline', 'l-deprenyl', ''eldepryl" and "monamine oxidase inhibitor-B". The Register at that time contained records from the following databases:</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:45:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>A single reviewer discarded irrelevant publications, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that an article could possibly be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (JSB and LF) independently reviewed the trials for inclusion from the culled citation list. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and any persisting differences were adjudicated by a third reviewer (JGE).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">QUALITY ASSESSMENT</HEADING>
<P>The same two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial. The quality of the methodology of each selected trial was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>) and the quality guidelines concerning blinding and loss before analysis developed by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials were included if they conformed to categories A or B, and those falling into category C were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">DATA EXTRACTION</HEADING>
<P>An individual patient data meta-analysis of selegiline, <LINK REF="REF-Wilcock-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcock 2002</LINK> provides much of the data that are available for this review. Individual patient data were requested from the investigators of each included trial. The investigators were asked to provide patient identity code, treatment to which the patient was randomized, date of start of treatment, certain baseline characteristics recorded before randomization (age, gender, severity of dementia), whether or not the patient completed the period of randomized treatment, and if not the date and reason for withdrawal. For each assessment of the patient the date of assessment and the outcome measures were requested.</P>
<P>Where it was not possible to retrieve individual patient data, data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome were the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted. For the global impression of change, the endpoint itself is of clinical relevance as all patients are by definition at the same baseline score. The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior. For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If any of the above data were not available in the publications, an "on-treatment" analysis was conducted and indicated as such.</P>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomization were eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>Data from titration phases prior to the randomised phase were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomised, nor were treatments concealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">DATA ANALYSIS</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease arise from ordinal rating scales. The rating scales used in the selegiline trials had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) and consequently the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (number of patients, mean and standard deviation) were calculated for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. For crossover trials only the data from the first treatment period were used. In addition, the estimated difference between selegiline and placebo and its standard error were calculated. For cognition the results are presented so that a positive value indicates that selegiline is better than placebo, and a negative value that selegiline is worse than placebo. For the other three domains the results are presented so that a negative value indicates that selegiline is better than placebo, and a positive value that selegiline is worse than placebo.</P>
<P>When individual patient data were available the summary statistics were calculated on recorded data with no attempt to impute missing data. Where individual patient data had not been retrieved, data extracted from published reports were used. When change from baseline results had not been reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach was considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis performed on the selegiline trials required the combination of trials providing individual patient data and those providing summary statistics extracted from publications. It was also necessary to combine results from different rating scales. The outcome measures can be directly compared where data are available from the same patients. Data were sought from within the trials to provide comparisons of the tests. Correlation coefficients were calculated and graphs plotted of pairs of points in order to assess the relationship between pairs of tests or scales. Outcome measures were selected taking into account the availability of data and the comparability of tests. Some investigators provided data of the sub scores within cognitive tests and rating scales which allowed for the more precise pooling of information across the different scales. It was often possible to match sub scores when the entire scales were not comparable.</P>
<P>The duration of the selegiline trials varied from 4 weeks to more than one year. This range was too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis and it was divided into small time periods. Some trials contributed data to more than one time period if multiple assessments had been done.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference between selegiline and placebo were calculated as weighted averages of the individual trial estimates. The measure of the treatment difference used was the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed effects model is presented and a test for heterogeneity is performed. In addition, when there are five or more studies the overall estimate from a random effects model is presented.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:45:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The Addional Table <I>Summary details of included trials</I> (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) describes the diagnostic criteria applied to the patients, the trial size, design, duration and times of assessment, and Additional Table <I>Baseline characteristics of the included trials</I> (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) describes the baseline characteristics of the treatment groups of the included trials.</P>
<P>The 34 selegiline trials reviewed have all been reported since 1987. 17 met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials used selegiline in combination with another dementia drug, or compared selegiline with such a drug. The latter type of trial was excluded. The former type presents a problem because the use of selegiline with another drug was not tested with a factorial 2x2 design. All patients received one drug and then, in addition, were randomised to selegiline or none. It is not possible to assess whether the drugs interact and the selegiline effect being tested here is not the same as in the strictly placebo-controlled trials.</P>
<P>All patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association) or DSM criteria (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>). The investigators often applied other criteria related to the severity of dementia, in order to identify patients whose disease was mild or moderate. Only the <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> trial specified that patients included were to be more severely demented.</P>
<P>The trials varied in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients most commonly excluded were those below 50 years of age, and those who were seriously ill with other diseases or with other degenerative diseases of the CNS or those suffering from depression. The mean age of patients in each trial was between 65 and 83 years.</P>
<P>A parallel group design was used in 10 trials, a cross-over design in seven. The trials were of duration between three weeks and years years. The dose of selegiline was 10 mg/day. Selegiline appeared to have no serious side effects and therefore there was no need for a dose titration period, although one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 1998</LINK>) started patients in the selegiline group with 5mg/day for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg/day. The 2x2 factorial trial design of the <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> trial included selegiline and vitamin E. In the <LINK REF="STD-Sunderland-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sunderland 1992</LINK> trial a best dose of physostigmine, identified in a titration phase prior to randomization, was administered intravenously to all patients immediately before assessments.</P>
<P>The primary hypothesis, as stated by the investigators, usually involved the investigation of the efficacy of selegiline for cognitive deficit and behavioural performance for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>, specifically mentioned the activities of daily living in the primary hypothesis, and three trials, <LINK REF="STD-Filip-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Filip 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Riekkinen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Riekkinen 1993</LINK>, mentioned the rate of progression of symptoms. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Riekkinen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Riekkinen 1993</LINK>, investigated safety and one, <LINK REF="STD-Sunderland-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sunderland 1992</LINK>, the synergistic effect of combining selegiline with physostigmine, although all patient were given physostigmine</P>
<P>All trials provided a baseline assessment and in all but one the patients were assessed at more than one time point post randomization, because for a progressive disease such as Alzheimer's disease the rate of decline is important. The design and purpose of <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> trial was different to the other trials in that patients were more severely demented when randomized and were expected to drop out during the 2-year trial when they reached an endpoint of death or severe incapacity.<BR/>
<BR/>Many different rating scales and tests were used to assess outcomes, with little consistency between studies, most scales appearing in only one study and rarely in more than two studies. More than 50 scales and tests were reported covering all the domains of interest. The tests assessing cognition included MMSE, ADAS-cog, Wechsler memory scale, Toulouse-Pieron Attention Test, Boston Naming Test, Rey-Auditory-Verbal Learning Tests, Trail making tests trails A, and Randt Memory Test. Most studies included an assessment of behaviour, using either the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia or a global rating scale. The rating scales and tests used in the meta-analyses are described in Addional Table <I>Rating Scales </I>(<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In most studies assessments were carried out at more than one time point after the base line assessment.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1996</LINK> described the method of randomization in great detail, and therefore was the only study to meet Category A criteria. All other included studies fulfilled Category B randomization criteria. </P>
<P>The number of dropouts was usually small, i.e. under 20%, and the numbers were similar for treatment and control groups within a study. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1993</LINK> reported 6 dropouts, 3 in each group out of 38 subjects over an 18 month period. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Filip-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Filip 1991</LINK> reported 30 dropouts, out of a total of 203 subjects, between randomisation and the commencement of treatment. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK>reported 24 subjects out of a total of 136 subjects had dropped out between randomisation and analysis. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Lawlor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lawlor 1997</LINK> reported 5 subjects who were not included in the analysis out of 25 entered subjects. <LINK REF="STD-Riekkinen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Riekkinen 1993</LINK> noted 13 subjects unavailable for analysis out of a total of 80 entered subjects. <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1996</LINK> reported 7 dropouts from the selegiline group and one from the placebo group out of a total of 51 subjects, but investigation revealed no likely connection to treatment. It must be noted that in this study it is unclear whether 7 or 5 patients dropped out from the selegiline group, the results presented suggest that there were final assessments made on all but 5 of the patients in the selegiline group. The main cause in all studies was noncompliance.</P>
<P>All the included studies were described as double blind.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:46:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There are 17 included trials. The results of the meta-analyses combining summary statistics calculated from individual patient data analyses and those from reports are shown in the analyses. There were very few significant differences and these were all in favour of selegiline; cognition at 4-6 weeks and 8-17 weeks, and activities of daily living at 4-6 weeks.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK> contributed most to the 2 statistic for heterogeneity. When this trial was removed from the meta-analyses of cognition there was no significant heterogeneity amongst the remaining trials, and only the meta-analysis at 4-6 weeks showed a significant treatment difference. When the <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Loeb-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 1990</LINK> trials were removed from the meta-analysis of the activities of daily living at 4-6 weeks, there was no heterogeneity amongst the remaining trials, and no significant treatment difference.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Withdrawal from trial and adverse events</HEADING>
<P>There is little evidence of adverse effects caused by selegiline, and few withdrew from trials, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>. The analyses were conducted on data available. There was no attempt to correct for missing patients because there were so few and withdrawal was probably unconnected with treatment.</P>
<P>All trials examined the cognitive effects of selegiline, and in addition 12 trials examined the behavioural and mood effects.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis revealed benefits on memory function, shown by improvement in the memory tests from several cognitive tests (the Randt Memory Index from <LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1992</LINK>, the BSRT from <LINK REF="STD-Sunderland-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sunderland 1992</LINK>, prose recall from <LINK REF="STD-Filip-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Filip 1991</LINK>, ADAS-cog from <LINK REF="STD-Lawlor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lawlor 1997</LINK>, the Wechsler Memory Scale from <LINK REF="STD-Loeb-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK>, the Rey -AVL from <LINK REF="STD-Piccinin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Piccinin 1990</LINK>, and the MMSE from <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Filip-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Filip 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Riekkinen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Riekkinen 1993</LINK>). The combined memory tests, and overall the combined cognitive tests, analysed using standardised mean differences, showed an improvement due to selegiline compared with placebo at 4-6 weeks (SMD 0.39, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.72, P=0.02, random effects model ) and 8-17 weeks, ( SMD 0.44, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.84, P=0.03, random effects model).</P>
<P>The meta-analyses of emotional state show no treatment effects.</P>
<P>Several studies assessed activities of daily living using several different scales, the GBS-motor function from <LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1990</LINK>, the NOSIE-daily living from <LINK REF="STD-Filip-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Filip 1991</LINK>, the BDS-daily living from <LINK REF="STD-Loeb-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK>, the DS from <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK> and PIADL from <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 1998</LINK>. The combined tests, analysed using the standardised mean difference, showed an improvement due to selegiline at 4-6 weeks (SMD -0.27, 95% CIs -0.41 to -0.13, P=&lt;.001) .</P>
<P>The global rating scales, the BDS used by <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 1998</LINK>, and the GBS used by <LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1992</LINK>, and the GDS used by <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1996</LINK> and the CGI by <LINK REF="STD-Filip-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Filip 1991</LINK> , analysed using standardised mean differences showed no effect of selegiline.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There were 17 included trials in this meta-analysis of selegiline for Alzheimer's disease. The designs of the trials had few features in common. They ranged in duration from 3 to 105 weeks, in size from 10 to 341 patients, had parallel or crossover groups, and had assessments every 2 weeks to every 3 months. The treatment was standard, at 10mg of selegiline daily. The studies applied various exclusion and inclusion criteria. The patients most commonly excluded were those below 50 years of age, and those who seriously ill with other diseases or with other degenerative diseases of the CNS. The mean age of patients was between 63 and 83 years. The meta-analysis was complicated by the diverse designs of the trials.</P>
<P>The results for cognition showed some significant differences for the earlier time points, and activities of daily living at 4-6 weeks but these could be explained by heterogeneity between the trials due to the <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK> trial or the <LINK REF="STD-Mangoni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mangoni 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Loeb-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 1990</LINK>. These two trials show effects that approach clinical importance but they were not in line with the results from the other trials.</P>
<P>The number of trials that contributed data after 3 months was small and dominated by the large trial of <LINK REF="STD-Sano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sano 1996</LINK>. There were no significant treatment differences at the later assessment times.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite its initial promise, i.e. the potential neuroprotective properties, and its role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease sufferers, selegiline for Alzheimer's disease has proved disappointing. Although there is no evidence of a significant adverse event profile, there is also no evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit for Alzheimer's disease sufferers. This is true irrespective of the outcome measure evaluated, i.e. cognition, emotional state, activities of daily living, and global assessment, whether in the short, or longer term (up to 69 weeks), where this has been assessed. There would seem to be no justification, therefore, to use it in the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There would seem to be no justification for any further studies of the efficacy of selegiline in Alzheimer's disease. the promise from early reports has not been supported by longer trials with better methodology. The real issue is that there are currently better avenues to research. </P>

<P>The RMT is specifically designed for longitudinal trials, including trials of possible memory enhancement with drugs, of subjects with mild to moderate memory loss, which can result from organic brain disease, and this includes AD. The test is focused on transfer to and retrieval from long term memory. It consists of seven subtests, general information, five items, digit span, paired words, short story, picture recognition, and incidental learning, and from these three total scores are derived (acquisition, recall and memory index). The five items and paired words resemble items found in the BSRT, and the digit span resembles the same item of the WMS. A zero score indicates the most severe cognitive impairment.<BR/>

<P>Wechsler Memory Scale</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>WMS</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The WMS has been used widely for memory testing, but is criticised because it measures learning rather than memory. It consists of seven subtests, information, orientation, mental control, logical memory, digit span, visual reproduction, and associate learning. The total score is the sum of the subtest scores. The memory quotient (MQ) is derived from this by adding an age correction, then referring the total to the table of MQs. The Revised WMS (WMS-R) (Wechsler 1987), comprises a series of brief subtests, some taken from the WMS, each measuring a different facet of memory, which are summarised into 5 composite scores and finally 2 major scores using weights prescribed by Wechsler. Some subtests of the Revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R) are identical to those of the WMS-R although the primary purposes of the tests are different.<BR/>
