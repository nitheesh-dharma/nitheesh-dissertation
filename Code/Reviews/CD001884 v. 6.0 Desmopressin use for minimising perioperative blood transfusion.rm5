<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-04 14:41:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Could desmopressin (a medicine that can be used to prevent bleeding) reduce the need for blood transfusion when people have surgery?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Blood loss is common during major surgery. Blood transfusions can replace blood that has been lost. Risks associated with blood transfusion include reactions against the blood, and &#8211; particularly in low- and middle-income countries &#8211; infection.</P>
<P>Desmopressin is a medicine commonly known as DDAVP (an abbreviation of its chemical name: 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin). It is used for people born with problems that put them at risk of bleeding, and may help people who do not have bleeding disorders. DDAVP may have side effects; for instance, it might increase risk of heart attack or stroke, or cause low blood pressure when it is given.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We investigated whether giving DDAVP reduced the need for blood transfusion in people having surgery.</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature to 3 April 2017. We identified 65 relevant trials with 3874 participants (adults and children). All trials assessed the effects of giving DDAVP before, during, or immediately after surgery or more minor procedures like biopsies. Most trials focused on adult heart surgery, or bone and joint surgery. Fewer trials focused on heart surgery for children, plastic surgery, surgery on blood vessels, or liver surgery. The trials were conducted between 1986 and 2016. Eleven were funded by pharmaceutical companies or by a party with a commercial interest in the trial&#8217;s outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Compared with placebo (an inactive substance that looks the same as the substance being tested, i.e. DDAVP) or no treatment, DDAVP may slightly reduce the amount of blood transfused in adult heart surgery. DDAVP may lead to little or no difference in the amount of blood transfused in heart surgery for children, bone and joint surgery, surgery on major blood vessels, or liver surgery. DDAVP probably leads to little or no difference in the total number of people who receive a blood transfusion. Whether DDAVP increases or reduces total blood loss is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. DDAVP may lead to little or no difference in the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke.</P>
<P>For people who are more vulnerable to bleeding because they are taking an antiplatelet medicine that stops their blood from clotting normally, DDAVP may lead to a reduction in the total volume of red cells transfused and in total blood loss. It probably leads to little or no difference in the number of people receiving a red cell transfusion. Whether DDAVP increases or reduces the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low.</P>
<P>Compared with tranexamic acid (a medication used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss) DDAVP may be less effective in reducing the volume of blood transfused and total blood loss. Whether DDAVP increases or reduces the number of people who receive a blood transfusion, or risk of death, heart attack, or stroke is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low.</P>
<P>Compared with aprotinin (another medication used to reduce bleeding) DDAVP probably increases the number of people who receive a blood transfusion. Whether it increases or decreases the risk of a heart attack or stroke is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. No trials comparing DDAVP against aprotinin reported the volume of blood transfused, total blood loss, or risk of death.</P>
<P>None of the 65 trials assessed quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate for the outcomes above. We considered many of the trials to be at high risk of bias and noted inconsistency and imprecision in their results.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, differences in transfusion and blood loss when people were treated with DDAVP or placebo were small and unlikely to be clinically important. It is possible that people who are more vulnerable to bleeding, such as those taking antiplatelet agents, may gain more benefit from DDAVP. Few trials compared DDAVP against tranexamic acid or aprotinin; consequently, we are uncertain whether DDAVP is better or worse than these agents.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-28 15:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blood transfusion is administered during many types of surgery, but its efficacy and safety are increasingly questioned. Evaluation of the efficacy of agents, such as desmopressin (DDAVP; 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin), that may reduce perioperative blood loss is needed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-06-26 17:42:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To examine the evidence for the efficacy of DDAVP in reducing perioperative blood loss and the need for red cell transfusion in people who do not have inherited bleeding disorders.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-26 16:33:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2017, issue 3) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases (all searches to 3 April 2017).</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-04 14:31:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 65 completed trials (3874 participants) and four ongoing trials. Of the 65 completed trials, 39 focused on adult cardiac surgery, three on paediatric cardiac surgery, 12 on orthopaedic surgery, two on plastic surgery, and two on vascular surgery; seven studies were conducted in surgery for other conditions. These trials were conducted between 1986 and 2016, and 11 were funded by pharmaceutical companies or by a party with a commercial interest in the outcome of the trial.</P>
<P>The GRADE quality of evidence was very low to moderate across all outcomes. No trial reported quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>DDAVP versus placebo or no treatment</B>
</P>
<P>Trial results showed considerable heterogeneity between surgical settings for total volume of red cells transfused (<I>low-quality evidence</I>) and for total blood loss (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>) due to large differences in baseline blood loss. Consequently, these outcomes were not pooled and were reported in subgroups.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, DDAVP may slightly decrease the total volume of red cells transfused in adult cardiac surgery (mean difference (MD) -0.52 units, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.96 to -0.08 units; 14 trials, 957 participants), but may lead to little or no difference in orthopaedic surgery (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.64 units; 6 trials, 303 participants), vascular surgery (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.73 units; 2 trials, 135 participants), or hepatic surgery (MD -0.47, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.33 units; 1 trial, 59 participants).</P>
<P>DDAVP probably leads to little or no difference in the total number of participants transfused with blood (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 25 trials; 1806 participants) (<I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Whether DDAVP decreases total blood loss in adult cardiac surgery (MD -135.24 mL, 95% CI -210.80 mL to -59.68 mL; 22 trials, 1358 participants), orthopaedic surgery (MD -285.76 mL, 95% CI -514.99 mL to -56.53 mL; 5 trials, 241 participants), or vascular surgery (MD -582.00 mL, 95% CI -1264.07 mL to 100.07 mL; 1 trial, 44 participants) is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low.</P>
<P>DDAVP probably leads to little or no difference in all-cause mortality (Peto odds ratio (pOR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.34; 22 trials, 1631 participants) or in thrombotic events (pOR 1.36, 95% CI, 0.85 to 2.16; 29 trials, 1984 participants) (<I>both low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>DDAVP versus placebo or no treatment for people with platelet dysfunction</B>
</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, DDAVP may lead to a reduction in the total volume of red cells transfused (MD -0.65 units, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13 units; 6 trials, 388 participants) (<I>low-quality evidence</I>) and in total blood loss (MD -253.93 mL, 95% CI -408.01 mL to -99.85 mL; 7 trials, 422 participants) (<I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>DDAVP probably leads to little or no difference in the total number of participants receiving a red cell transfusion (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.04; 5 trials, 258 participants) (<I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Whether DDAVP leads to a difference in all-cause mortality (pOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.22; 7 trials; 422 participants) or in thrombotic events (pOR 1.58, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.17; 7 trials, 422 participants) is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>DDAVP versus tranexamic acid</B>
</P>
<P>Compared with tranexamic acid, DDAVP may increase the volume of blood transfused (MD 0.6 units, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.11 units; 1 trial, 40 participants) and total blood loss (MD 142.81 mL, 95% CI 79.78 mL to 205.84 mL; 2 trials, 115 participants) (<I>both low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Whether DDAVP increases or decreases the total number of participants transfused with blood is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.64; 3 trials, 135 participants).</P>
<P>No trial reported all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>Whether DDAVP leads to a difference in thrombotic events is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low (pOR 2.92, 95% CI 0.32 to 26.83; 2 trials, 115 participants).</P>
<P>
<B>DDAVP versus aprotinin</B>
</P>
<P>Compared with aprotinin, DDAVP probably increases the total number of participants transfused with blood (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.45 to 4.02; 1 trial, 99 participants) (<I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>No trials reported volume of blood transfused or total blood loss and the single trial that included mortality as an outcome reported no deaths.</P>

<P>Most of the evidence derived by comparing DDAVP versus placebo was obtained in cardiac surgery, where DDAVP was administered after cardiopulmonary bypass. In adults undergoing cardiac surgery, the reduction in volume of red cells transfused and total blood loss was small and was unlikely to be clinically important. It is less clear whether DDAVP may be of benefit for children and for those undergoing non-cardiac surgery. A key area for researchers is examining the effects of DDAVP for people with platelet dysfunction. Few trials have compared DDAVP versus tranexamic acid or aprotinin; consequently, we are uncertain of the relative efficacy of these interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-04 15:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Red cell transfusion is common in the perioperative period for major surgery. Anaemia is known to be an independent predictor of poor outcomes following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2002</LINK>), but studies examining restrictive or liberal use of red cells in this setting have not found a clear beneficial effect for red cell transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Holst-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holst 2015</LINK>). Red cell transfusions are a biological product associated with risks such as infectious transmission and transfusion reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Delaney-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 2016</LINK>). Consequently, agents that could reduce blood loss and the need for red cell transfusion are needed. Recent work has demonstrated the importance of alternative agents such as tranexamic acid, which reduces red cell transfusion requirements and mortality without increasing the risk of thrombotic events when administered perioperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Ker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ker 2012</LINK>). Desmopressin (also known as DDAVP, or 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) has a potential role in this setting.</P>

<P>In 2014, people undergoing surgical procedures received 26.7% of the red cell units (12,318 units) transfused in the UK. The largest volumes of blood were transfused in cardiac surgery (6%; 2756 units), trauma (4.8%; 2193 units), orthopaedic surgery (3.9%; 1811 units), gastrointestinal surgery (3.8%; 1764 units), and vascular surgery (2.4%; 1091 units) (<LINK REF="REF-Tinegate-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinegate 2016</LINK>), with the remaining 5.8% transfused in surgery for other conditions. Blood loss is associated with increased mortality among people undergoing surgery and is associated with surgical complexity. The mortality risk of routine elective surgery is approximately 0.1%, rising to 1% to 2% for cardiac surgery and to 5% to 8% for vascular surgery (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). Between 5% and 7% of people undergoing cardiac surgery lose more than two litres of blood, and 3.6% to 4.2% of people require a second operation (reoperation) to arrest the bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). The need for reoperation is associated with a 4.5-fold increase in risk of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2009</LINK>), and blood loss of more than two litres is associated with an eight-fold increase in risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). Several key points apply in surgical operations for which an intervention such as DDAVP can be administered to prevent bleeding.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Anaesthetic induction: this involves the administration of a general anaesthetic or regional anaesthesia such as a spinal or epidural block and occurs before the operation.</LI>
<LI>First incision in the skin: the start of the operation.</LI>
<LI>Important time points during different types of operations.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Cardiac surgery: once the chest has been opened and the mediastinum accessed, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is initiated. This diverts blood from the heart and lungs, allowing them to be operated on. Patients are given heparin (an anticoagulant drug), which reduces the risk of blood clot formation while patients are on the bypass machine but renders them vulnerable to bleeding. When the procedure is finished, heparin is reversed with protamine, and normal circulation is restored.</LI>
<LI>Vascular surgery: for some procedures, large vessels such as the aorta are cross-clamped to allow visualisation of the operative field. When the clamps are removed and normal circulation restored, patients are at risk of blood loss from the newly perfused vessel and tributaries.</LI>
<LI>Orthopaedic surgery and plastic surgery: the blood supply to the limbs can be reduced temporarily by a tourniquet applied proximal to the area being operated on. Once the tourniquet is removed, normal blood flow returns, and this may lead to bleeding at the operative site.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Closure of the skin.</LI>
<LI>Postoperative recovery in an intensive care unit or a postoperative recovery ward depending on the type of surgery and any complications that may have arisen.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventional procedures</HEADING>
<P>Risk of bleeding is much lower for interventional procedures such as liver or kidney biopsy than for surgical operations. For example, risk of bleeding following a transjugular liver biopsy is approximately 0.07% and risk of death is 0.09% (<LINK REF="REF-Kalambokis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalambokis 2007</LINK>). For these procedures, bleeding is not expected, and the aim of treatment with a drug such as DDAVP is to prevent bleeding, rather than to reduce the volume of blood loss. These procedures may be performed with imaging (such as ultrasound) used to guide the procedure or with the use of anatomical landmarks. Bleeding may be difficult to detect, or it may occur at a site where it cannot be easily arrested, and where mechanical compression cannot be applied. The short duration of these procedures means that drugs such as DDAVP are administered before the procedure is started.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of people undergoing surgery that may make them vulnerable to bleeding</HEADING>
<P>Particular challenges in preventing blood loss are associated with people with platelet dysfunction (e.g. those taking antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, which inhibits the function of platelets and so makes these individuals more vulnerable to bleeding). Often antiplatelet agents cannot be stopped before an operation is performed because the procedure is urgent, or the risk of stopping the drug is considered too high (e.g. for those with a recent drug-eluting coronary artery stent). Other patients who are vulnerable to bleeding include those with low platelet counts or abnormal blood clotting, and those taking anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin.</P>

<P>Desmopressin is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. It is used most commonly for treatment of people with inherited bleeding disorders such as haemophilia A or von Willebrand disease, for whom it is administered at a dose of 0.3 &#956;g/kg subcutaneously or intravenously. Desmopressin has been in use for more than 40 years and is a relatively inexpensive drug to administer. Increases in von Willebrand factor (vWF) and in factor VIII have the potential to increase the risk of arterial or venous thrombotic events; this is an important safety consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Franchini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franchini 2007</LINK>). DDAVP also results in release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells, which can cause vasodilation with symptoms of facial flushing, tachycardia, and hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2003</LINK>). In rare cases, DDAVP administration may be associated with hyponatraemia and seizures, particularly when it is administered to young children (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1989</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-23 14:38:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Desmopressin stimulates the release of vWF from endothelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2003</LINK>). vWF is essential for forming normal blood clots through platelet adhesion and aggregation following endothelial injury (<LINK REF="REF-Mannucci-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannucci 2004)</LINK>. Increasing vWF levels for people undergoing surgery or invasive procedures may reduce the volume of blood that they lose (or may prevent them from losing blood), and consequently may reduce the need for red cell transfusion. vWF levels often rise naturally in response to stressful stimuli such as surgery, and the benefits of increasing vWF levels with DDAVP may vary according to baseline vWF levels. DDAVP takes approximately 30 minutes to reach peak effectiveness, and this effect lasts up to six to eight hours (<LINK REF="REF-Franchini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franchini 2007</LINK>). Consequently, the timing of its administration in clinical trials assessing its efficacy is of key significance. Release of vWF also results in an increase in procoagulant factor VIII levels, as vWF prolongs the half-life of factor VIII (<LINK REF="REF-Svensson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svensson 2014</LINK>), which may promote haemostasis or thrombosis. Tissue plasminogen activator, a key promotor of fibrinolysis, is released from Weibel-Palade bodies at the same time as vWF (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 2003</LINK>), and co-administration of an antifibrinolytic agent may increase the efficacy of DDAVP.</P>

<P>The need to identify effective agents for reduction of blood loss and improvement of surgical outcomes is ongoing. This review is an update of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2004</LINK>), and builds on the results of previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cattaneo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattaneo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crescenzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crescenzi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fremes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fremes 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levi 1999</LINK>). Desmopressin is a cheap drug that may provide particular benefit in countries where risk of infection or other adverse events from blood transfusion is high (<LINK REF="REF-Desborough-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desborough 2016a</LINK>). Currently, blood is not screened for transfusion-transmitted infection in 39 countries, and only 47% of transfusions from low-income countries are tested in laboratories with quality assurance. The risk of infection following transfusion in low-income countries is higher than in high-income countries: Recent figures show risk of 0.85% for HIV infection in low-income countries compared with 0.002% in high-income countries; similarly, 3.59% versus 0.02% for hepatitis B, and 1.07% versus 0.02% for hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2015</LINK>). Other agents such as tranexamic acid are used increasingly to reduce surgical blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Padhi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padhi 2015</LINK>).

<P>We anticipated that the timing of DDAVP administration would vary between trials, with some administering it preoperatively and others administering it during or after the operation.

Consequently, we considered this to be a key time point. We anticipated that most trials would not specify the timing of their assessments for each of the primary outcomes, so we allowed a broad period for reporting. We reported the timing of this outcome assessment in the results section and in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; assessment was performed most commonly up to 48 hours, and up to 72 hours in all but one case.</P>

When this was not possible, we selected the most appropriate pair of interventions and excluded the others (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>). We identified no cross-over trials, but for future updates, if we identify them, we plan to establish whether assessment of outcome measures occurred before the cross-over, and we will include outcomes assessed after the cross-over if they are not biased by treatment provided before the cross-over. We will examine each trial individually to determine this eventuality. We did not find any relevant cluster-randomised trials, but for future updates of this review, we plan to analyse cluster-randomised trials at the individual participant level, accounting for the cluster design, and to seek statistical advice.</P>

<P>We performed analyses according to recommendations provided in Chapter 9 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,</I> using aggregated data for analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). For statistical analysis, we entered data into Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). One review author (MD) entered the data, and a second (KO) checked the data for accuracy. When meta-analysis was feasible, we used the random-effects model for pooling data. We used the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes, and the inverse variance method (or standardised mean difference as necessary) for continuous outcomes. In cases for which events were rare and appropriate conditions were satisfied, we used Peto's odds method. We converted transfused blood volume expressed in millilitres (mL) to units by assuming 300 mL to be equivalent to one unit of blood (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2016</LINK>), as was done in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis (TSA)</HEADING>
<P>We provided a sample size estimate showing how many participants needed to be included in a meta-analysis for it to produce reliable results. We used trial sequential methods to explore all treatment effects attained before the required sample size was reached, by using TSA v0.9 software (<LINK REF="REF-TSA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSA 2011</LINK>). We sequenced trials by first publication date of the full articles. This provided the required information size (the total number of participants) necessary to detect a statistically significant underlying effect. We applied trial sequential analysis to the following outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>total volume of blood transfused (analysed in subgroups only);</LI>
<LI>number of participants transfused with blood;</LI>
<LI>total blood loss (analysed in subgroups only).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We estimated total volume of blood transfused and total blood lost by calculating the mean across the control arms of the trials. We calculated transfusion requirements in this population using the proportion of participants in the control group who were transfused. We calculated the information size necessary for a relative risk reduction of 15%, equivalent to the minimum clinically relevant effect size described for prophylactic use of tranexamic acid before surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ker 2012</LINK>). When calculated cumulative Z-curves crossed trial sequential monitoring boundaries, we determined that statistical significance had been reached and the overall type I error rate had been maintained. We produced futility boundaries such that if the cumulative Z-curve crossed the futility threshold, evidence showed that the two treatments did not differ more than the anticipated effect size. We used the O'Brien Fleming alpha-spending function with an overall type I error rate of 5% and with 80% statistical power to derive two-sided sequential monitoring and futility boundaries. We adjusted estimates according to calculated diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>). We calculated variance empirically and used a model variance-based heterogeneity correction. We performed TSA only for outcomes reported by two or more trials.</P>

Twenty-eight trials provided no information on the number of participants with platelet dysfunction.</LI>
<LI>Thirty trials did not include participants taking an anticoagulant drug; two trials included up to 10% of participants taking anticoagulants; no trials included more than 10% of participants taking an anticoagulant drug. Thirty-three trials provided no information about the number of participants taking anticoagulant drugs.</LI>

<LI>Sixteen trials did not include participants with thrombocytopenia, and 49 trials provided no information on the number of participants with thrombocytopenia.</LI>
<LI>Three trials included no participants who received an antifibrinolytic agent; three included 0.1% to 25% of participants taking antifibrinolytic agents; one included 25.1% to 50% taking antifibrinolytic agents; one included 50.1% to 75% taking antifibrinolytic agents; and four included more than 75% of participants taking antifibrinolytic agents. Six trials compared DDAVP directly with an antifibrinolytic agent, and in these trials, no participants in the DDAVP arm received an antifibrinolytic agent. Forty-seven trials provided no information about whether participants received an antifibrinolytic agent.</LI>

<P>Sixty-two trials compared DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin; desmopressin) versus placebo or standard care. Compared with placebo, DDAVP may lead to little or no difference in the total volume of red cells transfused for orthopaedic surgery, vascular surgery, or hepatic surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). DDAVP may slightly reduce the total volume of red cells transfused in adult cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). However, this difference is small and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit. DDAVP probably leads to little or no difference in the total number of people receiving a red cell transfusion (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). It is uncertain whether DDAVP improves or worsens total blood loss because the quality of evidence is very low (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). DDAVP may lead to little or no difference in the risk of mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>) or thrombotic events (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-04 12:48:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides the most up-to-date evidence for administration of DDAVP to minimise blood transfusion. The review identified 65 trials with 3874 participants and four ongoing trials with 147 participants. Most of these trials (46/65; 71%) were performed over 20 years ago, and changes in surgical and transfusion practice since that time may alter the relevance of these findings. The most common trial settings were adult cardiac surgery (39/65 trials; 60%) and orthopaedic surgery (12/65 trials; 18%); relatively few trials have examined the use of DDAVP in other types of surgery. Only 20 of the 65 (31%) trials administered DDAVP preoperatively, three trials (5%) administered DDAVP in combination with an antifibrinolytic agent, 12 trials (18%) included more than 75% of participants with platelet dysfunction, and no trials included people with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. These key groups are relatively under-represented in the review dataset. Across all outcomes, available data on overall mortality and adverse events due to thrombotic events are insufficient to show clearly whether an increase, or a decrease, in events is associated with DDAVP administration. No trials reported quality of life.</P>

<P>We have summarised the GRADE quality of evidence in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>, and <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. We downgraded all outcomes one point for risk of bias. Most trials did not report sufficient detail to allow assessment of bias. We considered only one trial to be at low risk of bias in all domains. Domains with high risk of bias included blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Heterogeneity was a problem for continuous outcomes, total volume of blood loss, and total number of red cells transfused owing to large differences in baseline blood loss between procedures. Mortality and thrombotic events were rare and, consequently, introduced risk of imprecision. Lastly, the trials in this review did not represent many types of surgery, and this introduced inconsistency. This was particularly the case for comparisons of DDAVP versus tranexamic acid or aprotinin.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-23 17:58:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We noted no obvious biases within the review process. We conducted a wide search - that was not restricted by language or by full-text publication - to optimise the chances of identifying all relevant trials. Two review authors who were blinded to the other's results performed screening and data extraction in duplicate to minimise bias. A limitation of this review is that for many outcomes, the original authors published results in a format that did not allow inclusion in meta-analysis (e.g. reported medians and ranges instead of means and standard deviations). This meant that many published trials did not contribute data to the outcomes, particularly for total volume of blood transfused and total blood loss.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-23 18:00:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2004</LINK>). The original review identified 29 eligible trials. In 2008, another published meta-analysis included 38 eligible trials (<LINK REF="REF-Crescenzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crescenzi 2008</LINK>). Compared with the most recent systematic review of DDAVP for prevention of perioperative transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Crescenzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crescenzi 2008</LINK>), this review identified 26 more trials with an additional 1386 participants. For the present update, we included interventional procedures and children, neither of which were eligible for inclusion in the original Cochrane Review. The overall findings of this update are similar to those of the original review, which also found small decreases in the total volume of red cells transfused and in total blood loss, but no difference in the number of participants receiving a red cell transfusion nor in overall mortality or thrombotic events. The original review examined heterogeneity through sensitivity analysis by subgroups (cardiac surgery and other): participants taking antiplatelet agents, use of cell salvage, use of a transfusion protocol, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. Data on the subgroup of participants with platelet dysfunction or taking antiplatelet agents have been co-published separately (<LINK REF="REF-Desborough-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desborough 2017</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-04 14:38:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Findings from 65 trials conducted worldwide show no benefit of DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin) for unselected patients. Small reductions in blood loss and in total volume of red cells transfused were noted in cardiac surgery, but these are unlikely to be clinically important. No difference was found in mortality or adverse events (such as thrombotic events) with the use of DDAVP, as there were so few events.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-04 14:44:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence available for assessment of the value of DDAVP in surgery was low. Benefits in unselected patients appear to be small, and it is unlikely that additional trials will change this finding. Subgroups of people with platelet dysfunction or taking antiplatelet agents may gain greater benefit from DDAVP, and this may be a topic for future research. Incorporation of point-of-care platelet function tests or viscoelastic tests in future trials may allow greater precision in the selection of patients who may derive the greatest benefit from DDAVP; this is another potential topic for research.</P>

<P>The title has changed from 'Desmopressin use for minimising perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion', to 'Desmopressin use for minimising perioperative blood transfusion', as we felt that the latter encapsulated the scope of the review more accurately.</P>
<P>We have included a copy of amendments to the original protocol in <LINK TAG="PUBLIC_NOTES" TYPE="SECTION">Published notes</LINK>. We updated the original review in accordance with current Cochrane MECIR standards (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Carless-2004">Carless 2004</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Henry-1998">Henry 1998</A>). The original review was published in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1998</LINK>). Methods have changed considerably since that time, as has clinical management of perioperative blood loss. Consequently, we published an updated protocol before commencing this review (<LINK REF="REF-Desborough-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desborough 2016</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between prespecified changes to the protocol and the published review due to lack of data</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>For types of participants, we have added the following text: &#8220;We excluded trials in participants with inherited bleeding disorders such as haemophilia A or von Willebrand disease. DDAVP is already part of standard of care in mild-to-moderate haemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, and inherited platelet function disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Estcourt-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estcourt 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeling-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeling 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laffan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laffan 2014</LINK>)." These participants were also excluded in original iterations of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>In the protocol, we intended to report the primary outcomes at three separate time points: intraoperatively, at 24 hours, and total blood loss. We removed the 24-hour time point for clarity because in most cases, this was the same as total blood loss.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Data were insufficient for assessment of subgroups of participants with liver disease and uraemia, so we did not perform this analysis. Future updates of this review will include analysis of these subgroups if published data are sufficient. We added platelet dysfunction as a subgroup because publication of recent guidelines has suggested that this is of greatest interest to clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-American-Society-of-Anesthesiologists-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Society of Anesthesiologists 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kozek_x002d_Langenecker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozek-Langenecker 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rossaint-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossaint 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Society-of-Thoracic-Surgeons-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2011</LINK>). We included subgroups of trials that performed cell salvage or used a transfusion protocol as sensitivity analyses rather than full subgroups. In the previous iteration of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2004</LINK>), participants in these subgroups were not found to be different from those not in the subgroups. Consequently, although we believed it was not appropriate to include them as full subgroups in this iteration, we have monitored their effect on the overall effect estimate by including them in sensitivity analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>In addition to changes outlined in the subgroup section above, we made changes to the definition of 'low-risk trials'. We did not provide a precise description of a trial at low risk of bias in the protocol, which included the following text: "for example, RCTs with methods assessed as low risk for random sequence generation and concealment of treatment allocation". We adjusted the definition of trials at low risk of bias to: "trials with no high risk of bias assessments and at least half low risk of bias assessments". This yielded a global assessment of risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Timing of outcome assessments</HEADING>
<P>In the protocol, we intended to assess transfusion and blood loss intraoperatively, at 24 hours, and at 30 days. Most trials reported outcome data up to 24 to 48 hours. Consequently, we did not include the 24-hour time point and reported total blood loss, volume of red cells transfused, and participants receiving a red cell transfusion. In most cases, timing for these outcomes was 24 to 48 hours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Most included trials did not report serious adverse events, with the exception of clinically important hypotension and thrombotic events (which are already included as separate outcomes). For clarity, we reported clinically important hypotension as an outcome rather than as a serious adverse event.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will perform an assessment of all RCTs using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool according to Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011b">Higgins 2011b</A>). Two review authors will work independently to assess each element of potential bias listed below as 'high', 'low', or 'unclear risk of bias'. We will report a brief description of the judgement statements upon which review authors have assessed potential bias in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We will ensure that a consensus on the degree of risk of bias is met through comparison of review authors' statements and, when necessary, through consultation with a third review author. We will use the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias, which includes the following domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias: random sequence generation and allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>performance bias: blinding of participants and personnel;</LI>
<LI>detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment;</LI>
<LI>attrition bias: incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>reporting bias: selective reporting;</LI>
<LI>other bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we will record means, standard deviations, and total numbers of participants for both treatment and control groups. For dichotomous outcomes, we will record numbers of events and total numbers of participants for both treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes using the same scale, we will perform analyses using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes measured on different scales, we will present the standard mean difference (SMD). If available, we will extract and report hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality data. If HRs are not available, we will make every effort to estimate the HR as accurately as possible using available data and a purpose-built method based on the Parmar and Tierney approach (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Parmar-1998">Parmar 1998</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Tierney-2007">Tierney 2007</A>).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we will report the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs. When the number of observed events is small (&lt; 5% of sample per group), and when trials include balanced treatment groups, we will report the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Deeks-2011">Deeks 2011</A>).</P>
<P>If data allow, we will undertake quantitative assessments using Review Manager 5 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-RevMan-2014">RevMan 2014</A>).</P>
<P>When appropriate, we will report the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) with CIs.</P>
<P>If we cannot report available data in any of the formats described above, we will prepare a narrative report, and, if appropriate, we will present the data in tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>We do not expect to encounter unit of analysis issues, as we are unlikely to include cluster-randomised trials, cross-over studies, and multiple observations for the same outcome in this review. Should we identify any studies of these designs, we will treat them in accordance with advice given in Chapter 16 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011c">Higgins 2011c</A>). If participants are randomised more than once we will contact the authors of the study to request data on the procedure associated with the initial randomisation. For studies with multiple treatment groups, two review authors will exclude subgroups that are considered irrelevant to the analysis. We will tabulate all subgroups in the 'Characteristics of included studies' section. When appropriate, we will combine groups to create a single pair-wise comparison. If this is not possible, we will select the most appropriate pair of interventions and will exclude the others (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011c">Higgins 2011c</A>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>When we identify data as missing or unclear in published literature, we will contact study authors directly. We will record the number of participants lost to follow-up for each study. When possible, we will analyse data on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, but if insufficient data are available, we will present per-protocol analyses (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011c">Higgins 2011c</A>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If clinical and methodological characteristics of individual studies are sufficiently homogeneous, we will combine the data to perform a meta-analysis. We will assess statistical heterogeneity of treatment effects between studies using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with a significance level of P &lt; 0.1. We will use the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to quantify the degree of potential heterogeneity and will classify it as moderate if I<SUP>2</SUP> is less than 50%, or considerable if I<SUP>2 </SUP>is between 50% and 80%. We will assess potential causes of heterogeneity by conducting sensitivity and subgroup analyses (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Deeks-2011">Deeks 2011</A>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>When we identify at least 10 studies for inclusion in a meta-analysis, we will explore potential publication bias (small-trial bias) by generating a funnel plot and performing a linear regression test. We will consider a P value of less than 0.1 as statistically significant for this test (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Sterne-2011">Sterne 2011</A>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will perform analyses according to recommendations provided in Chapter 9 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,</I> using aggregated data for analysis (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Deeks-2011">Deeks 2011</A>). For statistical analysis, we will enter data into Review Manager 5 software (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-RevMan-2014">RevMan 2014</A>). One review author will enter the data, and a second review author will check the data for accuracy.</P>
<P>When meta-analysis is feasible, we will use the fixed-effect model for pooling data. We will use the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes, and the inverse variance method (or standardised mean differences as necessary) for continuous outcomes. When events are rare, and appropriate conditions are satisfied, we will use the Peto odds method. We will use the generic inverse variance method for time-to-event outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>We will provide a sample size estimate showing how many participants need to be included in a meta-analysis for reliable results. We will use trial sequential methods to explore all treatment effects attained before the required sample size is reached, using TSA v0.9 software (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-TSA-2011">TSA 2011</A>). We will sequence trials by first publication date of the full articles. This will provide the information size required to detect a statistically significant underlying effect. We will apply trial sequential analysis to the following outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mean blood loss up to 24 hours post procedure; and</LI>
<LI>number of participants transfused with blood up to 24 hours post procedure.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We will calculate mean blood loss and transfusion requirements for this population by using the mean blood loss and transfusion requirements derived from control group data. We will calculate the information size necessary for a relative risk reduction of bleeding and of receiving a red cell transfusion of 15%, which is equivalent to the effect size proposed for prophylactic use of tranexamic acid before surgery (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Ker-2012">Ker 2012</A>).</P>
<P>If the calculated cumulative Z-curve crosses trial sequential monitoring boundaries, we will consider statistical significance to be reached while maintaining the overall type I error rate. Futility boundaries will be produced such that if the cumulative Z-curve crosses the futility threshold, evidence shows that the two treatments do not differ more than the anticipated effect size. We will use the O'Brien Fleming alpha-spending function with an overall 5% type I error rate and 80% statistical power to derive two-sided sequential monitoring and futility boundaries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We will use the GRADE approach to create a 'Summary of findings' table, as suggested in Chapters 11 and 12 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a">Schünemann 2011a</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1602161054124786363330492114162&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b">Schünemann 2011b</A>). We will use the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low', or 'very low', using the five GRADE considerations:</P>
<UL>

<LI>type of participant (liver disease and kidney disease with uraemia);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Changes to future updates of this review</HEADING>
<P>In future updates of this review, review authors will compare only DDAVP versus placebo (or standard of care) and will remove comparisons of DDAVP versus tranexamic acid and DDAVP versus aprotinin.</P>
<P>In addition, review authors will limit the time period for follow-up for primary outcomes to 48 hours, rather than up to 30 days.</P>
