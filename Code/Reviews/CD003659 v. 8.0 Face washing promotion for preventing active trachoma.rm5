<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-17 20:34:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Research question</B>
<BR/>We investigated whether face washing prevents active trachoma in endemic communities.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Trachoma is an eye disease caused by bacterial infection. Active infection usually begins in childhood and is characterized by eye discharge, redness and irritation. Poor facial hygiene can lead to the disease spreading from person to person through eye-seeking flies or contaminated fingers. Face washing is promoted as part of the World Health Organization 'SAFE' strategy to eliminate blindness around the world. Face washing is simple and rational, but its effectiveness to reduce transmission of trachoma is uncertain.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We included two randomized controlled trials with a total of 2560 participants set in Australia and Tanzania. One trial compared a combined strategy of face washing plus tetracycline (an antibiotic) ointment with tetracycline ointment alone for up to one year. The second trial compared four intervention groups for three months in children who already had follicular trachoma: a combined strategy of face washing plus tetracycline eye drops, face washing alone, tetracycline eye drops alone, and no treatment. The evidence is current to January 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Both trials reported the number of children with active trachoma as an outcome measure; one trial also reported the number of children with severe trachoma and the percentage of clean faces after one year. One trial reported that face washing was effective in increasing facial cleanliness and in reducing severe trachoma at one year; the second trial did not show that eye washing alone or in combination with tetracycline eye drops reduced follicular trachoma amongst children who had follicular trachoma at time of enrollment.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>The two included trials were of uncertain risk of bias due to not reporting many aspects of the trial designs.</P>

We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 January 2015.</P>
<P>To identify further relevant trials we checked the reference lists of the included trials. Also, we used the Science Citation Index to search for references to publications that cited the trials included in the review. We contacted investigators and experts in the field to identify additional trials.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial authors for additional information when needed. Two trials met our inclusion criteria; but we did not conduct meta-analysis due to methodological heterogeneity.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-13 15:17:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included two cluster-RCTs, which provided data from 2447 participants. Both trials were conducted in areas endemic to trachoma: Northern Australia and Tanzania. The follow-up period was three months in one trial and 12 months in the other; both trials had about 90% participant follow-up at final visit. Overall the quality of the evidence is uncertain due to the trials not reporting many design methods and the differences in outcomes reported between trials.</P>
<P>Face washing combined with topical tetracycline was compared with topical tetracycline alone in three pairs of villages in one trial. The trial found that face washing combined with topical tetracycline reduced 'severe' active trachoma compared with topical tetracycline alone at 12 months (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.97); however, the trial did not find any important difference between the intervention and control villages in reducing other types of active trachoma (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.59). Intervention villages had a higher prevalence of clean faces than the control villages among children with severe trachoma (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.59) and any trachoma (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.72) at 12 months follow-up. The second trial compared eye washing to no treatment or to topical tetracycline alone or to a combination of eye washing and tetracycline drops in children with follicular trachoma. At three months, the trial found no evidence of benefit of eye washing alone or in combination with tetracycline eye drops in reducing follicular trachoma amongst children with follicular trachoma (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11; one trial, 1143 participants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-15 14:39:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from one trial that face washing combined with topical tetracycline may be effective in reducing severe active trachoma and in increasing the prevalence of clean faces at one year follow-up. Current evidence is inconclusive as to the effectiveness of face washing alone or in combination with topical tetracycline in reducing active or severe trachoma.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-13 14:35:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trachoma is an infective eye disease caused by the bacterial microorganism <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I>. Trachoma remains a major cause of avoidable blindness among underprivileged populations in many areas of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, where poverty, overcrowding, poor personal and environmental hygiene favor transmission of the disease. It is estimated that about 146 million people have active trachoma and nearly six million people are blind due to complications associated with repeat infections (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997a</LINK>). <I>C. trachomatis</I> bacteria is spread from person to person by close contact in overcrowded living conditions, or through contaminated fingers or cloths used by mothers to wipe away discharges on the faces of children (<LINK REF="REF-ICEH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICEH 1999</LINK>). Flies, which are attracted to eye and nasal secretions on the faces of infected children, also are believed to be vectors responsible for transmission of the organism (<LINK REF="REF-ICEH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICEH 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In communities where trachoma is endemic, infection usually begins in childhood and repeat episodes of infection cause distortion of the eyelids (entropion), in-turned eyelashes (trichiasis), corneal abrasion and ultimately blindness due to corneal opacity. Active trachoma is more commonly observed in children (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=382901090217040249&amp;versionPK1=98890850854777977963120221103757&amp;versionPK2=z1412152121448284141194655970581#REF-Taylor-1985">Taylor 1985</A>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>). It is characterized by redness and discharge associated with inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva (mucous membrane lining the inner surface of the upper eyelids) and follicles (whitish elevations within the conjunctiva). A simplified grading system for the assessment of trachoma and its complications in endemic communities has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK>) and discussed in a Cochrane review of antibiotics for trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-01 18:44:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Andrew Law">
<P>Face washing is promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) program for the global elimination of trachoma as part of the 'SAFE' strategy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The 'SAFE' strategy consists of <B>s</B>urgery for trichiasis; <B>a</B>ntibiotics for infectious trachoma; <B>f</B>acial cleanliness to reduce transmission; and <B>e</B>nvironmental improvements (household sanitation and provision of clean water).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-13 11:04:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The face washing component of the SAFE strategy aims to maintain clean faces in the community in order to reduce eye-seeking flies and person-to-person transmission of <I>C. trachomatis</I>. Face washing promotion as a community intervention can be combined with mass treatment of people with antibiotics in areas with high trachoma endemicity. Mass treatment with antibiotics aims to reduce the reservoir of <I>C. trachomatis</I> in the community, while face washing aims to interrupt the cycle of infection and re-infection in the long term. The antibiotic and environmental arms of the SAFE strategy have been examined in other published Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabiu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabiu 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-12 15:55:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The face washing principle appears simple and theoretically sound, but whether this intervention can reduce transmission of trachoma in practice has been the focus of debate (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2001</LINK>). Some narrative reviews of the literature have suggested that facial cleanliness may be useful in preventing trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pruss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pruss 2000</LINK>). However, most of the data were obtained from observational studies and the methodological quality of the few controlled trials included was not reported. In this Cochrane review we aim to summarize systematically, research evidence from trials of face washing promotion for preventing active trachoma in endemic communities. In communities where water is scarce, the uptake and practice of face washing may not be as good as in communities where water is freely available. We will consider the potential influence of water availability on outcomes in this review.</P>

<P>We considered the following outcomes for comparison of interventions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Number of participants with active trachoma (TF or TI) at 6, 12 or greater than 12 months post-treatment allocation (age group as reported in trials). We defined active trachoma using the <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK> scale. On this scale, active trachoma is categorized as TF or TI. TF is trachoma follicular inflammation and is defined as the presence of five or more follicles, each of which is at least 0.5 mm in diameter, on the flat surface of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. TI is intense inflammation of the tarsal conjunctiva due to trachoma and is defined as the presence of marked inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than half of the deep conjunctival vessels. We planned to include trials that used other trachoma grading scales to assess active trachoma, provided the scales used were comparable to the <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK> scale;</LI>
<LI>Number of participants with an unclean face at 6, 12 or greater than 12 months post treatment allocation (age group as reported in trials). We defined an unclean face as the presence of eye or nasal discharge (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) or any other definition used in trials;</LI>
<LI>Post hoc: Number of participants with severe trachoma. We did not specify severe trachoma among cases of active trachoma as an outcome in the protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ejere-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejere 2002</LINK>).

<P>Two review authors independently assessed included trials using the following criteria based on Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Risk of bias domains assessed were selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment before randomization), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective outcome reporting) and other potential sources of bias. While masking of participants and intervention providers was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention of interest, masking of outcome assessors was possible and was assessed post hoc. We judged each included trial for each domain as being at "low", "unclear" "or "high" risk of bias and provided the rationale for each judgement. We provided direct quotes from included trials where appropriate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting and participants</HEADING>
<P>We included two cluster-RCTs (2560 children in total) conducted in areas endemic to trachoma. <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> was undertaken in Kongwa, Tanzania and included a total of 1417 children, aged one to seven years. Six villages were paired based on characteristics; one village of each pair was randomized to intervention and the other assigned to control. <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK> was undertaken in the Northern Territory of Australia. In this trial 36 aboriginal communities were randomized to one of three intervention groups or one control group. A total of 2530 children aged five to 14 years were screened for follicular trachoma. Several children above the age of 14 years and some of preschool age were also screened. Of the total number of children screened in the participating communities, 1143 children with follicular trachoma were recruited into the trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Both trials incorporated face washing as an intervention in the trial, but used different study designs and implementation methods. In <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>, three villages (680 children) were randomized to face washing promotion combined with tetracycline and the three remaining villages (737 children) were assigned to tetracycline ointment alone. Face washing promotion was community-based and consisted of neighborhood meetings to build consensus for increasing face washing and reinforcement activities such as school plays, seminars with the traditional healers and meetings with other village groups. Face washing promotion was carried out for one month during and after mass treatment with tetracycline. Tetracycline ointment was administered topically once daily for 30 days.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK>, 36 villages were randomized to either tetracycline eye drops (374 children), eye washing (246 children), eye washing combined with tetracycline eye drops (312 children) or no intervention (211 children). Children in the eye washing group had their eyes washed daily by school teachers for three months. Those in the tetracycline group had tetracycline eye drops applied daily for one week every month for three months. For the purpose of this review, we have reported data for the comparison between eye washing versus no treatment, and eye washing combined with eye drops versus eye drops alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>, outcomes reported include active trachoma, severe trachoma and clean faces at 12 months. Trachoma was graded using the <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK> scale. <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> defined severe trachoma as 15 or more follicles, or the presence of inflammation that obscured all vessels of the tarsal plate. We abstracted data from graphs presented in the report of the trial, as rates and raw data were unavailable. These abstracted data should be regarded as best approximations to the true figures. Our protocol specified 'unclean faces' as an outcome of interest, but <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> reported 'clean faces'. We elected to present the outcome as reported in the trial because it would be difficult to transform the data without sufficient information from the trialists.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK>, the primary outcome was reported as the proportion of children with follicular trachoma at three months after the intervention. The Aboriginal Health Workers used a simplified grading scheme to assess the presence of follicles as indicating active trachoma. Although this scale is crudely comparable to the TF grading on the <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1987</LINK> scale, it may have a lower specificity because participants with fewer than five follicles may have been classified as having active trachoma.</P>

Steps were taken to ensure that the outcome assessors did not learn to which groups the communities were allocated. Different personnel carried out each intervention, namely eye washing and eye drops. School teachers washed the eyes of the children, while Aboriginal health workers or nurses administered eye drops. Since different personnel carried out each intervention, workers could have become unmasked based on the presence or absence of certain personnel.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>, face washing combined with antibiotics was compared to antibiotics alone in three pairs of villages. In pair one, the percentage prevalence of active trachoma was reported to be lower in the village that received a combination of face washing and antibiotics than the village that received antibiotics alone at 12 months follow-up (approximately 55% compared to 60%; as read from figures; no numerical data provided for this pair or the other two pairs of villages). In a second pair of villages, the percentage of active trachoma also was lower in the combination intervention village than the antibiotics alone village (approximately 40% compared to 50%). However in a third pair of villages, the percentage of active trachoma in the combination intervention village was higher than the antibiotics alone village (approximately 70% compared to 65%). The overall results for all the combination intervention villages compared to the antibiotics alone villages suggest a reduction in the odds of any trachoma but this effect was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.59).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK>, 191/246 children (77.6%) in the eye washing group had follicles at three months compared with 160/211 (75.8%) in the no treatment group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The difference was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14). In the eye washing/eye drop combination group, 215/312 (68.9%) had follicles at three months compared to 250/374 (66.8%) in the eye drop only group. The difference was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13).

<P>When the <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK> investigators fitted a logit model to the data to account for variations in participant age, geographical location and trachoma outcome assessors, the adjusted odds of having follicular trachoma were slightly higher in the eye drop only group compared to the eye washing/eye drop combination group (adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI not reported).

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> 12-month prevalence of severe trachoma was compared between the intervention and control villages within each pair of villages. In pair one, the percentage prevalence of severe trachoma was lower in the village that received a combination of face washing and antibiotics than in the village that received antibiotics alone (approximately 8% compared to 14%). In a second pair of villages, the percentage of active trachoma also was lower in the combination intervention village than the antibiotic alone village (approximately 6% compared to 14%).

The CIs and the numbers used to calculate these differences were not reported so that CIs of the differences could not be calculated. The overall results reported after adjustments for age and baseline trachoma status suggest a statistically significant reduction in the odds of severe trachoma by the face washing/antibiotics combination compared to antibiotics alone (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Active trachoma</HEADING>
<P>Two included trials reported active trachoma (defined as TF or TI with five or more follicles or inflammation obscuring at least half of tarsal conjunctiva vessels). The findings were either inconsistent within a trial or showed that the face washing/eye drop combination had no benefit.</P>
<P>It is unclear why face washing promotion combined with tetracycline had an effect on reducing active trachoma in two pairs of villages but no effect in a third pair in <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>. Differences in baseline characteristics such as prevalence of trachoma, intensity of transmission, availability or access to water supplies between the third pair and the first two pair of villages may be important in explaining the differences in benefit. However, the overall results for the face washing/tetracycline combination villages compared to the tetracycline only villages suggest a modest, but not statistically significant, beneficial effect of face washing in reducing active trachoma at 12 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK> suggested no benefit for face washing compared with no treatment or for the face washing/eye drops combination in comparison to eye drops alone. The age of participants varied, and there was a higher proportion of severe trachoma among older children. There were variations in the prevalence of trachoma in the different geographical locations from which the participating communities were drawn, as well as small differences in the diagnostic competence of outcome assessors. The trial authors hypothesized that community randomization in the trial may not have adequately controlled for these factors, hence the need to account for them. After fitting the data to a logit model to control for perceived imbalances in the ages of participants, geographical location and outcome assessors, a marginal but not statistically significant benefit was seen for the face washing/eye drops combination compared to the eye drops alone group. However, the report does not state whether the analysis of outcomes via logistic regression models was prespecified or post-hoc.</P>

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> reported on severe trachoma (defined as TF or TI with more than 15 follicles or inflammation obscuring all the tarsal conjunctiva vessels). We refer to this outcome as "severe active trachoma". As for all active trachoma, the benefit of face washing in reducing the prevalence of severe trachoma was observed in two pairs of villages at 12 months follow-up, but not in the third pair. The reasons for this difference in outcome may have been due to differences in baseline characteristics of villages and participants, particularly the severity of trachoma at baseline.</P>

Although the reports of the design and conduct of the trials suggest that efforts were made by the investigators to assure high quality outcome data, lack of adequately reported information made it difficult to judge trial quality based on key quality parameters specified for this review (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK> reported outcomes at three months. Although the follow-up period fell short of what we specified in our protocol, we did not exclude the data from this trial in view of the paucity of RCTs. The two trials were conducted in Australia and Africa. Their generalizability to other countries and settings where trachoma is endemic is unknown.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Active trachoma</HEADING>
<P>If face washing indeed is beneficial with respect to active trachoma, the absence of an effect of face washing in <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK> may be due to a number of factors. Firstly, the trachoma grading system used in the trial may have influenced the results. Participants were recruited into the trial on the basis of whether follicles or papillae were present. Children without trachoma who had follicles/papillae from other causes could have been included. For this group of children, treatment likely had no benefit. Furthermore, participants whose trachoma was less severe may not have experienced a benefit of face washing.</P>
<P>Secondly, in analyzing the results using the intention-to-treat principle, the trial authors assumed that all participants lost to follow-up had follicular trachoma at the end of the trial. If this assumption was incorrect and there were more participants lost to follow-up in a treatment group compared to control, as was the case with the eye washing group (17% versus 10.4%), treatment might appear to be ineffective compared with control. However, a sensitivity analysis with the missing participants excluded from analysis did not alter the result.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the intervention was administered for only three months. A longer intervention period and follow-up might have yielded different findings.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <LINK REF="STD-Peach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peach 1987</LINK> applied face washing to children with established disease rather than the population at risk, and measured the outcome in this group of children. The face washing strategy aims to reduce active trachoma in endemic communities, mainly by reducing the transmission of the disease. The true impact of face washing on active trachoma in the communities might be better evaluated by a study design in which face washing is applied to whole populations at risk rather than only those with the disease and the number of new cases of disease since institution of the intervention determined. It is unclear how much impact on transmission can be achieved by applying face washing only to individuals in endemic communities who already have the disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Severe trachoma</HEADING>
<P>The overall results of <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> for all the villages after adjusting for age and baseline trachoma status showed a benefit of face washing in reducing severe trachoma in the intervention villages compared to the control villages at 12 months follow-up. It is probable that participants with severe active trachoma represent a subgroup with more intense transmission and therefore face washing, which aims to break transmission, would be more likely to show a stronger effect within this subgroup. On the other hand, the appropriateness of combining the results from the three pairs of villages is questionable, since presumably the villages were paired because of some differences among them. It is unclear why face washing showed no comparative benefit in the three pairs of villages at six months follow-up. Apparent benefit at 12 months underscores the importance of a longer follow-up period to ascertain the impact of the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clean faces</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence regarding the benefit of cleaning faces daily is largely unknown based on information available for the two included trials. Several methodological details were unreported or unclearly reported (allocation concealment, method of randomizations and attrition). There was inconsistency between the trials regarding the effect of clean faces on active trachoma.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-02-13 14:44:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used a comprehensive search strategy in multiple databases, thus minimizing missed trials. There was no language restriction in the search for trials in order to reduce bias in locating eligible trials. The two included trials were conducted at least 20 years before this Cochrane review (reported in 1987 and 1995). We identified a completed but not yet reported study in our searches for eligible trials. Inclusion of findings from that study in our next review update may change our conclusions. We contacted trial authors for missing data and two review authors extracted data from the included trials.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-13 13:10:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Stocks-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stocks 2014</LINK> showed a possible beneficial effect of clean faces in reducing the odds for active trachoma (TI/TF). Its objective was to "summarize the evidence in order to devise strategic and cost-effective approaches to trachoma prevention" (<LINK REF="REF-Stocks-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stocks 2014</LINK>). It included non-randomized studies that reported evidence showing that face washing at least once a day has an impact on both TF and TI (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96). It also showed that other hygiene-related exposures affect active trachoma (TI/TF), such as: ocular discharge, nasal discharge, soap use, bathing at least once a day and towel use. The methodological quality of the included studies was not addressed adequately in <LINK REF="REF-Stocks-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stocks 2014</LINK>.</P>

<P>Evidence from one trial suggests that face washing added to tetracycline eye drops can be effective in increasing facial cleanliness and in reducing severe trachoma during a 12-month period, but its effect in reducing active trachoma remains unknown. In the second trial, there was no evidence of a beneficial effect of face washing alone or in combination with tetracycline in reducing active trachoma in children with follicular trachoma.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-13 13:11:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this review evaluated the effect of face washing over a three- to 12-month period. However, it is unclear whether this time period is long enough for a face washing promotional activity to demonstrate impact of the intervention. Therefore, if future research is continued in this area, longer follow-up periods should be used. Other areas for research would be to address the questions of whether reinforcement activities are required over time to improve outcome and the impact of better access to water in reducing trachoma. The reporting of the methodology of trials should be complete to enable reviewers and readers to assess the validity of their conclusions.</P>
