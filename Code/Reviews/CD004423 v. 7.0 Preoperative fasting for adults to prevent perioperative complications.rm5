<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>General anaesthetic reduces reflexes that stop regurgitated gastric juices reaching the lungs. As this can be dangerous, people are often advised to have nothing to eat or drink from the midnight before surgery. However, the review of trials found that drinking clear fluids up to a few hours before surgery did not increase the risk of regurgitation during or after surgery. Some people are considered more likely to regurgitate under anaesthetic, including those who are pregnant, elderly, obese or have stomach disorders. More research is needed to determine whether these people can also safely drink up to a few hours before surgery.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Fasting before general anaesthesia aims to reduce the volume and acidity of stomach contents during surgery, thus reducing the risk of regurgitation/aspiration. Recent guidelines have recommended a shift in fasting policy from the standard 'nil by mouth from midnight' approach to more relaxed policies which permit a period of restricted fluid intake up to a few hours before surgery. The evidence underpinning these guidelines however, was scattered across a range of journals, in a variety of languages, used a variety of outcome measures and methodologies to evaluate fasting regimens that differed in duration and the type and volume of intake permitted during a restricted fasting period. Practice has been slow to change. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To systematically review the effect of different preoperative fasting regimens (duration, type and volume of permitted intake) on perioperative complications and patient wellbeing (including aspiration, regurgitation and related morbidity, thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety) in different adult populations. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic databases, conference proceedings and reference lists from relevant articles were searched for studies of preoperative fasting in August 2003 and experts in the area were consulted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials which compared the effect on postoperative complications of different preoperative fasting regimens on adults were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Details of the eligible studies were independently extracted by two reviewers and where relevant information was unavailable from the text attempts were made to contact the authors. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty eight randomised controlled comparisons (made within 22 trials) were identified. Most were based on 'healthy' adult participants who were not considered to be at increased risk of regurgitation or aspiration during anaesthesia. Few trials reported the incidence of aspiration/regurgitation or related morbidity but relied on indirect measures of patient safety i.e. intra-operative gastric volume and pH. There was no evidence that the volume or pH of participants' gastric contents differed significantly depending on whether the groups were permitted a shortened preoperative fluid fast or continued a standard fast. Fluids evaluated included water, coffee, fruit juice, clear fluids and other drinks (e.g. isotonic drink, carbohydrate drink). Participants given a drink of water preoperatively were found to have a significantly lower volume of gastric contents than the groups that followed a standard fasting regimen. This difference was modest and clinically insignificant. There was no indication that the volume of fluid permitted during the preoperative period (i.e. low or high) resulted in a difference in outcomes from those participants that followed a standard fast. Few trials specifically investigated the preoperative fasting regimen for patient populations considered to be at increased risk during anaesthesia of regurgitation/aspiration and related morbidity. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest a shortened fluid fast results in an increased risk of aspiration, regurgitation or related morbidity compared with the standard 'nil by mouth from midnight' fasting policy. Permitting patients to drink water preoperatively resulted in significantly lower gastric volumes. Clinicians should be encouraged to appraise this evidence for themselves and when necessary adjust any remaining standard fasting policies (nil-by-mouth from midnight) for patients that are not considered 'at-risk' during anaesthesia. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-02 19:21:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sally EM Bell-Syer">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>FASTING BEFORE GENERAL ANAESTHESIA<BR/>Restriction of food and fluid intake prior to general anaesthesia has long been seen as vital to patient safety, as a method of reducing the risk of regurgitation of gastric contents. When anaesthesia is induced there is a depression of the gag, cough and swallow reflexes. The extent to which the reflexes are depressed depends on the level of anaesthesia but may extend to eventual absence of the laryngeal and pharyngeal reflexes. These reflexes usually protect the airway and their reduced function carries a risk of pulmonary aspiration should regurgitation or vomiting of gastric contents occur. In cases where the lungs aspirate gastric contents, patients are at risk of pneumonia and even death. Preoperative fasting deprives patients of nutrition and hydration. Medical and nursing staff concerned for their patients' well being, hydration, comfort and safety strive to establish safe levels of preoperative fasting without unnecessary starvation of patients.</P>
<P>CRITICAL VALUES<BR/>The critical values of gastric volume and pH at which patients become at increased risk of aspiration, with associated increased morbidity and mortality is unclear. Referring to an unpublished study on rhesus monkeys, <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1974</LINK> 'arbitrarily' set critical values of gastric contents for an adult human female as a pH value of &lt; 2.5 and volume of &gt; 0.4 ml/kg. Others have questioned the accuracy of these values in humans (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Raidoo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raidoo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1984</LINK>). Ethically, it may be impossible to establish precisely the values of gastric volume and pH that increase the risk of aspiration related complications. However, intra-operative gastric content parameters are frequently used as proxy outcome measures, in evaluation of different preoperative fasting regimens. </P>
<P>NIL BY MOUTH (nulla per os or NPO)<BR/>Established by anaesthetists and enforced by nursing staff, the extent of the preoperative fast varies across hospitals and even between wards. The traditional fasting instruction is nil by mouth (NPO) from midnight (if on the morning list for surgery). A light, early breakfast of tea and toast is often allowed if the patient expects surgery in the afternoon. NPO from midnight is a widespread fasting policy that is easy to administer, allows for alteration to the order of the operative list, and is often unquestioned by staff and patients alike. In practice however, the fasting period has frequently been found to be in excess of the NPO from midnight recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Maclean-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maclean 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearse 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crenshaw-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crenshaw 2002</LINK>) though there are also recent suggestions of a change in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>CLINICAL PRACTICE<BR/>A number of preoperative fasting guidelines for adult patients undergoing elective surgery have been published (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CAS-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAS 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>). These guidelines recommend an evolution from the indiscriminate 'NPO from midnight' blanket fasting policy to a more complex approach to the fasting intervention. This more sophisticated approach is typified by a shorter NPO fast, preceded by a period of restricted intake. The type and amount of fluids/solids permitted during this period of restricted intake and the duration of the NPO fast are of significance. </P>
<P>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>) recommend that adults stop intake of solids for at least six hours, and clear fluids for two hours or more, prior to induction of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The Canadian Anaesthetists' Society (<LINK REF="REF-CAS-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAS 1990</LINK>) recommend a total fast of no less than five hours and suggest that policies be constructed within individual departments. The Norwegian clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>) also suggest a fast from solids of six hours and from clear fluids up to two hours before induction of anaesthesia. Several other national guidelines follow the recommendations of the ASA (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CSBS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSBS 2002</LINK>) and others are in development (<LINK REF="REF-RCN" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN</LINK>). Despite the availability of guidelines, the pace of change in clinical practice has been slow. </P>
<P>Local policies require the consensus of the multidisciplinary team including the anaesthetist, nursing staff and surgeons. The disparate nature of the trials, interventions and outcomes makes it difficult for individual clinicians to evaluate the quality and relevance of the evidence for themselves. Thus, some clinicians may well be reluctant to alter an existing policy that has adequately ensured patient safety (if perhaps not comfort) for many years (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-McKinley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jester-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jester 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connolly-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ettinger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ettinger 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE<BR/>Several investigators have explored the use of more complex preoperative fasting regimens. However, 'evidence' of the optimum fasting regime is published across many journals, in a variety of languages and the number of possible fasting regimens and outcome measures make comparisons difficult. While the aim of preoperative fasting is to reduce event sequences, which begin with regurgitation and aspiration and may result in pulmonary damage, pneumonia and even death, the incidence of such events is rare (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SASM-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SASM 2002</LINK>). The skilled perioperative, anaesthetic and surgical multidisciplinary team strive to prevent such occurrences. The size of trial required to demonstrate a difference in the effectiveness of a fasting regimen based on such rare but clinically important outcome measures, would be prohibitive. </P>
<P>Though gastric content values of volume and pH can only be considered surrogate measures of risk, more reliable measures are not (and may never be) available. In some cases non-absorbable marker dyes have been used. Bromosulphthalein [BSP] or phenol red are ingested preoperatively and their dilution intra-operatively, by the intra-operative gastric volume, provides an indication of the degree of gastric emptying. Results are expressed as a percentage of the original dye ingested. Another marker dye, cyanocobalamin, was introduced in a known concentration into participants' stomachs intra-operatively (Hausel 2001). After 10 minutes the concentration of the dye in a 5ml sample of gastric contents was measured and from this the participants' intra-operative gastric fluid volume could be calculated (mls). Other outcome measures evaluate patients' perception of comfort (e.g. thirst, hunger, anxiety) or focus on 'physiological' gastric content measures (volume and pH) as an indication of risk of aspiration.</P>
<P>In some studies the evidence in relation to preoperative fasting is further complicated by the preoperative administration of a pharmacological co-intervention. Ranitidine, roxatidine (used in some Japanese trials), famotidine and cimetidine are H2-receptor antagonists that function to inhibit the production of gastric acid. Other agents such as antacids (which raise gastric pH) or anti-emetic drugs which increase gastrointestinal motility (e.g. metoclopramide, domperidone) may also be prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some patient populations are well recognised to be at increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration. Those who have a history of gastrointestinal disease or autonomic neuropathy, those who are pregnant and elderly patients may have delayed rates of gastric emptying and thus are considered to have particular preoperative fasting needs (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2001b</LINK>). As a result, the picture in relation to the optimum preoperative fasting regimen is complex. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-06-02 19:11:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sally EM Bell-Syer">
<P>The objective of this review was to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise the evidence in relation to different preoperative fasting regimens (duration, type and volume of permitted intake) in terms of perioperative complications and patient well being (including aspiration, regurgitation and related morbidity, thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety) in different adult populations. We examined the evidence to establish:</P>
<P>1. What is the optimal duration of a preoperative fast from fluids/solids for adults (in terms of minimising perioperative complications)?</P>
<P>During a preoperative fasting period that permits some restricted intake<BR/>2. What is the optimal type of intake permitted and<BR/>3. What is the optimal volume of permitted intake in terms of minimising perioperative complications</P>
<P>Some patient populations are considered at higher risk of aspiration related complications e.g. those that are pregnant, obese or elderly<BR/>4. To what extent does the evidence support different fasting regimes for different at-risk patient populations?</P>
<P>In imposing a fast prior to surgery, consideration is given to all of these issues (i.e. duration of fast, type of permitted intake, volume of permitted intake and at-risk patient subgroups). Together, these four elements of a fasting regimen comprise the preoperative fasting intervention and will be considered in turn throughout the review.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-06-02 18:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sally EM Bell-Syer">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared different fasting regimens in terms of duration or type/volume of intake prior to general anaesthesia. Where no RCT addressed a specific intervention, less robust methods of allocation to concurrent intervention groups were considered (e.g. quasi-randomised trials based on the day of the week or month of the year).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Male and female adults (18 years or above) undergoing general anaesthesia. In general trials within the review are based on healthy participants undergoing anaesthesia (ASA I-II <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). This review also identified trials that evaluated the evidence for preoperative fasting regimens of high-risk anaesthetic patients including those who are<BR/>(a) Pregnant (second trimester or later)<BR/>(b) Postpartum<BR/>(c) Obese<BR/>(d) Elderly and those with<BR/>(e) Gastric disorders or disease.<BR/>The results from the trials based on these subgroups are presented separately (see Objective 4).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>For the purposes of the review a Standard Fast is defined as nil by mouth from midnight before morning surgery and a small breakfast early in the morning before afternoon surgery. This fasting regimen also permits the intake of a small amount of fluid (10-30mls) to assist the intake of oral medication. Studies that evaluated the following fasting regimens were considered for inclusion in the review. The order they are presented in corresponds to the objectives of the review.</P>
<P>1. Duration of fast<BR/>(a) Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast<BR/>(b) Shortened Solid Fast v Standard Fast<BR/>(c) Shortened Solid Fast v Shortened Fluid Fast</P>
<P>2. Type of Permitted Intake (during a restricted fasting period)<BR/>(a) Fluid Intake Permitted (e.g. water, coffee, orange juice) v Standard Fast<BR/>(b) Fluid 1 v Fluid 2</P>
<P>3. Volume of Permitted Intake (during a restricted fasting period)<BR/>(a) Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>(b) Volume of Fluid Intake 1 v Volume 2</P>
<P>Investigations which also evaluated the administration of a prokinetic, H2-receptor antagonist or antacid agent but in which the control group did not receive a similar administration of the drug were excluded from the review. For the purposes of the comparisons addressed within the review most control groups followed a Standard Fast regimen. In some cases however two experimental interventions were compared (e.g. fluid and solid intake v fluid intake) and these are detailed accordingly.</P>

<P>Much of the outcome data in this review (e.g. residual gastric values of volume and pH) have skewed distributions. As there is no clear indication of what degree of skewness meta-analysis can accommodate, we chose, whenever possible, to present mean and SD summary data for the outcome measures gastric volume and pH within a meta-analysis. Where these values were not directly available from the trial report or from the authors, 'pseudo-values' were calculated (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, the term 'pseudo' is used to indicate that the values for the mean (pseudo-mean) and SD (pseudo-SD) are not 'true' mean and SD values. These pseudo-values are estimates of what the true mean and SD values might be, that allow for the uncertainty entailed by not actually observing them directly, only indirectly via other summary measures. Keith O'Rourke from the Centre of Statistics in Medicine developed two approaches to the calculation of these values (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first which is fairly mathematical calculates and uses a likelihood based on the summaries in hand (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>). The second makes use of mean-variance (technically location-scale) relationships between a standardised distribution and the sampling distribution of summaries in hand (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1992</LINK>). For instance, if we assume normally distributed outcomes with unknown mean (mu) and unknown standard deviation (SD), the sampling distribution of the median would have mean equal to mu + SD * (mean of a standardised normal distribution - here equal to 0) while the sampling distribution of the maximum would have mean equal to mu + SD * (maximum of a standardised normal distribution - which depends on the sample size but can be approximated to any degree of accuracy by simple simulation). Similar relationships hold between the variances and covariances. These relationships enable one to get generalised least squares estimates of the most appropriate pseudo-means and pseudo-variances for various assumed distributions for the original un-summarised outcomes. These pseudo-means and pseudo-variances are then entered into RevMan and treated as if they were actually observed (the process above makes allowance for them being estimated rather than actually observed). This second approach was the primary approach to calculation of the pseudo-values used and presented within this review - although where possible the likelihood approach was used for comparison purposes. For instance, with the trials that reported median and range (minimum, maximum) the likelihood calculations were exact for both symmetric and asymmetric distribution and there were no discernible differences between these two assumptions.</P>
<P>The primary continuous outcome variables in relation to gastric content (volume, pH, marker dye concentration) were summarised using weighted mean differences. Using the RevMan 4.2.1 package, chi-square calculations (significance level set at p &lt; 0.1) were used to assess heterogeneity between trials which evaluated similar interventions using similar outcome measures. Trials were pooled using a random effects model in the absence of clinical or methodological heterogeneity, and the presence of statistical heterogeneity. A random effects model was also used to pool summary data that included pseudo-value calculations. Details of these aspects will be reported for each section.</P>
<P>The various subjective approaches used to evaluate the secondary outcome measures of thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety could not be pooled in a quantitative fashion but were summarised in a tabular format. Details of the measurement tool, the timing of the measurement, the comparisons made and the results of the comparison were profiled and discussed in a narrative fashion within the results section. The evidence based on the patient population subgroups considered to be at increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration during anaesthesia (as outlined within the protocol) was also identified and presented within the review.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Twenty two trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review of adult preoperative fasting and included participants aged 18 years or more. Two trials had extended the participant age range to include individuals from the age of 15 (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>) and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>) recruited individuals aged 13-19 years. A post protocol decision was made to include these trials within this review of adult preoperative fasting.</P>
<P>The 22 trials were conducted in a number of different countries. Seven were conducted in the UK (Miller 1983; <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK> Samaan 1989, <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>), six in Canada (Maltby 1986, Sutherland 1987, <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>, Hutchinson 1988, <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>), three in Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; Yatsu 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>), two in India (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>) and one each in Sweden (Hausel 2001), Norway (Søreide 1993), USA (<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>) and the People's Republic of China (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>). Given the trials' wide range of geographical settings there is remarkable methodological consistency across the 20 trials that sampled gastric contents. </P>
<P>Collection of gastric contents was generally conducted by aspirating the contents of the stomach by syringe following insertion of a tube. The tubing was described as a sump tube by some (Maltby 1986, Sutherland 1987, Hutchinson 1988, <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; Søreide 1993, Yatsu 1996, <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>; Samaan 1989) while others describe the use of similar orogastric tubes (Miller 1983, <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>). One trial used a nasogastric tube (Hausel 2001). Sizes of tubing were 14-18 gauge. </P>
<P>In all cases the gastric contents were collected post induction of anaesthesia though some authors have further qualified this as 'immediately' post induction (Søreide 1993, <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>), 'pre intubation' (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>), 'post intubation' (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>) or 'within 10 mins of induction' (Sutherland 1987). In one trial, samples were collected post surgery but duration of surgery was described as being no longer than 10 minutes (Maltby 1986). Thus collection of the gastric contents occurred within a similar time frame. </P>
<P>A variety of tools were used to measure pH values including pH radiometer (Maltby 1986, Sutherland 1987, <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; Hausel 2001), indicator strip (Søreide 1993), pH paper (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>), electrode (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>), moving coil meter (Miller 1983) and the remainder describe use of a Corning pH meter. Some reports also detail calibration of these methods of measurement (Maltby 1986, Sutherland 1987, Hutchinson 1988, <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>). </P>
<P>Fifteen trials reported the patients' experience of the fasting process with reference to the secondary outcomes addressed by this review; <B>thirst</B> (Maltby 1986; Hutchinson 1988; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; Yatsu 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; Hausel 2001), <B>hunger</B> (Maltby 1986; Hutchinson 1988; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; Yatsu 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; Hausel 2001) <B>pain</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; Søreide 1993; Hausel 2001), <B>nausea</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; Hausel 2001), <B>vomiting</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) and <B>anxiety</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>). Given the wide variety of methodologies used to evaluate these measures and the subjective nature of their report (in most cases participants self-report) a qualitative approach to between-trial comparisons was adopted. Details of the secondary outcome measures employed (detailing the method and timing of the data collection) will be presented within the results section. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) only collected such secondary outcome measures and so their results do not appear elsewhere in the review. <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK> employed a linear analogue scale to measure secondary outcomes, which will be referred to as a visual analogue scale. The duration of the postoperative hospital stay identified in the review protocol as a secondary outcome measure was not measured by any of the trials.</P>
<P>Three trials recruited participants considered to be at increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration during anaesthesia - i.e. obese individuals (Body Mass Index &gt; 30kg.m<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>), and women postpartum (1-5 days <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; 1-4 days <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>). Of the remaining trials most were based on healthy participants classified as ASA I-II (Table 02). Three trials did not report ASA status (Miller 1983; Maltby 1986; <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>). All trials (except <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>) reported that participants were undergoing elective surgery. All trials took measures to exclude gastric disease, disorders and/or drugs that affected gastric secretion or motility. </P>

<P>The 22 trials included in this review describe the randomised allocation of 2270 participants across 61 control/intervention arms Some 133 participants across three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>) were not included in the review as the intervention they were exposed to did not contribute to the evaluation of a preoperative fasting regimen but evaluated the effectiveness of a pharmacological intervention. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>) also reported an additional 70 non-randomly allocated participants who were excluded from the review. The trials identified and included in the review were small with all control and intervention groups consisting of fewer than 100 participants. Only three trials randomised more than 150 participants; Hutchinson 1988 (n = 300), Samaan 1989 (n = 180), Hausel 2001 (n = 252). Nine trials randomised between 100 and 150 participants (Maltby 1986; Sutherland 1987; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>) and ten trials were based on fewer than 100 participants (Miller 1983; <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; Yatsu 1996).</P>
<P>The quality of the investigative studies was independently examined by two of the reviewers (MB and SK). The method of generating the randomisation sequence was evaluated as adequate in 12 trials (Maltby 1986; Sutherland 1987; Hutchinson 1988; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; Samaan 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>; Søreide 1993; Hausel 2001; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>), partially adequate in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>), inadequate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>) and unknown for the remaining seven trials (Miller 1983; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; Yatsu 1996). Similarly methods of concealment of allocation varied. Concealment of allocation was classified as adequate in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>; Hausel 2001; Samaan 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>), inadequate in eight (Maltby 1986; Sutherland 1987; Hutchinson 1988; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>), and unknown in the remaining nine trials (Miller 1983; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; Yatsu 1996) (see Characteristics of Included Studies).</P>
<P>In evaluating preoperative fasting regimens, complete blinding of both participants and assessors as to the intake of food/fluid is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Blinding of the anaesthetist, sample collector and assessor is achievable for trials that aim to measure gastric content values. Participants, however, cannot be blinded as to whether or not they have had something to eat or drink, and even blinding as to the volume of intake is difficult. Some comparisons do allow for such blinding. Five trials blinded participants as to the type of pharmacological co-intervention by administering either placebo or ranitidine/famotidine (Maltby 1986; Sutherland 1987; Hutchinson 1988; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; Samaan 1989). Evaluation of this pharmacological intervention however was not the focus of this review, though a similar approach was employed by Hausel 2001 when participants were blinded as to type of fluid they were drinking preoperatively (a carbohydrate drink or a flavoured water placebo). The difficulty of blinding participants as to whether they have had a drink/eaten is acknowledged and the impact this might have on the collection of outcome measures (e.g. patient reports of thirst, hunger, anxiety, nausea) is recognised and will be explored further in the results and discussion sections. For the purposes of evaluating the quality of the trials, blinding ratings refer to the adequacy of blinding the assessors that collected and measured the gastric content values only and not to the blinding of participants or individuals involved in the collection of patient reported secondary outcome measures.</P>
<P>All 22 trials listed inclusion and exclusion criteria, though the degree of reporting detail varied (see Characteristics of Included Studies for details). No trial described the use of an <I>a priori</I> sample size calculation. Participant groups were demonstrated to be comparable at baseline except for a between-group difference in weight in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>) and duration of intake restriction in another (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>). Intention to treat analysis was not reported in any trial. Fifteen trials reported omission of some data from analysis (details are presented in Characteristics of Included Studies). The remaining eight trials did not report any withdrawals and in five trials it was clear that all participants had been included in the data analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; Soreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; Yatsu 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>). Quality was not used to weight the trials in the meta-analyses of this review but will be commented on, as appropriate, within the results and discussion sections. Full details of the trials' quality evaluation are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> Details of Quality Evaluation by Trials.</P>
<P>It was clear from examining the available mean and standard deviation (SD) summary data that there was some indication of skewed distribution (mean/SD &lt; 1.64). Given the nature of the gastric volume and pH continuous outcome measures it was not unexpected to find naturally positively skewed distributions. Several authors (in personal correspondence) also highlighted this fact and indicated that this was a factor in their choice of summary statistics, as skewed distributions are most appropriately summarised using median and range values (detailing the minimum and maximum). Unfortunately the phrase 'appropriately summarised' that is often used in statistical textbooks refers to descriptive rather than "inferential" purposes - skewed distributions are poorly described by the mean and variance but the mean and variance can actually contain more information about the distribution of outcomes than the median and range values. In fact for inferential purposes it would be much better to provide means, variances and percentiles for each group - essentially avoiding as much "summarisation" as patient confidentiality and the journal editor will allow.</P>
<P>In the past pooling of data in a meta-analysis was restricted to those trials that used means and SDs as summary statistics. Taking this approach, the presentation of the gastric pH and volume data would be restricted to those trials that chose to report means and SDs as summary statistics. Those trials that had taken the more cautious (albeit less inferentially appropriate) approach to the reporting of skewed data would be excluded, thus biasing the review's reporting and presentation process. In addition, even amongst those trials that had used means and SDs as summary statistics, there was some indication that they were also based on skewed distributions (mean/SD &lt; 1.64).</P>
<P>Twenty of the 22 trials included in the review incorporated intra-operative measures of gastric contents' volume and pH. Methods of reporting the summary data for these continuous outcome measures (volume and pH) varied across trials. Mean and standard deviation gastric content values (volume and pH) were available in either published or unpublished format for thirteen trials (Maltby 1986; Sutherland 1987; Hutchinson 1988; <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; Søreide 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>; Yatsu 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>; Hausel 2001). Three trials reported mean and standard deviation values for the gastric pH (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; Samaan 1989) or volume (Miller 1983) measures. Five trials chose to summarise gastric volume outcomes using mean and range values (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; Samaan 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>) while gastric pH was reported as mean and range (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>) or median and range (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; Miller 1983). <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK> reported gastric volume in terms of mean, median and range values.

<P>Pseudo-values were calculated for gastric volume summary data for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; Samaan 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>) and the pH summary data for 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>; Samaan 1989; Miller 1983; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>). Pseudo-values for the volume data for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>) are still outstanding. The combination of reported summary statistics within the <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK> trial requires a separate calculation programme that is currently in development. The mean summary data for this trial is included within the meta-analysis tables but the SD data has been presented as zero (0) indicating that a pseudo-standard deviation value has yet to be calculated and that the data from this trial does not contribute to the pooled result.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-02 19:21:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sally EM Bell-Syer">
<P>The results of the systematic review are presented in relation to four parameters under consideration in prescribing a preoperative fasting regimen i.e. duration of fast, type of permitted intake and volume of permitted intake during the fasting period and risk of regurgitation/aspiration during anaesthesia. The evidence in relation to each of these parameters is examined with reference to, firstly the primary outcome measures of aspiration/regurgitation, and then the gastric content values (volume, pH, marker dye concentration). The secondary outcome measures of thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety are discussed within each section and summarised in a tabular format (<LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK> to <LINK REF="TBL-52" TYPE="TABLE">Table 52</LINK>). A key to these tables is available in <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>. The evidence presented here is extensive. Many details of the results in relation to the secondary outcomes are presented within the Additional Tables section (<LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK> to <LINK REF="TBL-52" TYPE="TABLE">Table 52</LINK>) and are referred to as appropriate within the text.</P>
<P>Eight of the 22 trials included in the review had three or more comparison arms (Miller 1983; Maltby 1986; Sutherland 1987; Hutchinson 1988; Samaan 1989; Yatsu 1996; Søreide 1993; Hausel 2001). In some cases both interventions were included in the one comparison for meta-analysis purposes (e.g. water intake v standard fast (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>); carbohydrate drink v standard fast (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) in a comparison of Type of Intake - Short Fluid Fast v Standard Fast). These subdivisions of trials will be referred to as 38 separate trials throughout the remainder of the review. Details of the nature of the different comparisons (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK> from <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988e" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988e</LINK>) are available in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. Where trials required one control group to be compared with two or more interventions the results from the control group were divided into the corresponding number of groups (<LINK REF="REF-Oxford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford 2001</LINK>). In this way comparisons between interventions could be included while avoiding the inclusion of the control individuals twice in the meta-analysis. Divisions were as equal as possible but in whole numbers (i.e. without splitting a participant). Appropriate standard deviations were calculated from the available results.</P>
<P>Few trials reported the incidence of aspiration/regurgitation (and any associated morbidity/mortality); the primary outcomes of this review. Where these results were available they were presented in <LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK>;<LINK REF="TBL-24" TYPE="TABLE">Table 24</LINK>;<LINK REF="TBL-36" TYPE="TABLE">Table 36</LINK>;<LINK REF="TBL-49" TYPE="TABLE">Table 49</LINK>. Given the complexity of the topic and the number of comparisons and outcomes addressed within this review, an overview of the results is available to the reader at the end of the results section.</P>
<P>1. DURATION OF FAST<BR/>The trials that compared a standard fasting regimen to a shorter fast from (a) fluids or (b) solids are presented in this section as are trials that compared a shortened solid fast versus a shortened fluid fast (c). All trials were based on healthy adult participants considered to be at normal risk of regurgitation/ aspiration during anaesthesia. Each comparison is presented in relation to the outcomes used to measure the effectiveness of the experimental fasting regimen, namely (i) aspiration/regurgitation, (ii) the volume of gastric contents, (iii) the pH of gastric contents, (iv) measures of gastric volume and emptying using marker dye and (v) secondary outcomes. An overview is available at the end of the results section.</P>
<P>(a) DURATION - SHORTENED FLUID FAST v STANDARD FAST<BR/>(i) Aspiration/Regurgitation<BR/>Despite being one of the outcomes of central importance to patients and staff only three trials that compared a shortened fluid fast to a standard fast reported the incidence of adverse events and associated morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) and six recorded the incidence of regurgitation/aspiration (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). None of these trials observed any aspiration/regurgitation (though <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK> appeared to confine this report to the intervention group) and no trial measured the incidence of related morbidity or case fatality. Details can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK> Duration of Fast - Aspiration/Regurgitation.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>Twenty-four trials used a measure of gastric volume to compare a standard fast with a fast that permitted some fluid intake. The trials are grouped based on the timing of intake (intake permitted up to 90 minutes, between 120-180 minutes and up to 180 minutes preoperatively). The results were pooled using a random effects model and the details are presented within a meta-analysis in Comparison: 01 Duration - Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 01 Gastric Contents - Volume (ml).</P>
<P>01 Fluid (up to 90 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast<BR/>The gastric volume of participants given one of two different amounts of water (150ml and 300-450mls) (total n = 50) was compared to the gastric volume of a standard fasting group (total n = 25) by two trials (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>). On pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference in gastric content volume between the groups (WMD -8.00 mls CI 95%[-25.53, 9.53]).</P>
<P>02 Fluid (between 120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast<BR/>Twenty trials compared the intake of fluids between 120-180 minutes preoperatively (n = 762) and a standard fasting regimen (n = 570). Pseudo-values for five trials were calculated (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>) but are still awaited for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups' gastric volume (WMD -0.84mls CI 95%[-2.77, 1.08]).</P>
<P>There was however some indication of heterogeneity (p = 0.05). It was evident that mean gastric volume reported by some trials was considerably lower than the volumes reported by other trials. For example, one group that followed a standard fasting regimen had a mean gastric volume of 9.7 mls (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>) compared to another group following the standard fast who had a mean gastric volume of 23.2 mls (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>). There was little difference between the type, volume and timing of the intake of preoperative fluid but two of the trials had administered an H2-receptor antagonist (ranitidine) co-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>). A decision was made to examine this difference throughout the review by conducting an unplanned subgroup analysis on the basis of H2-receptor antagonist co-interventions.</P>
<P>03 Fluid (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (No H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Twelve trials compared a shortened fluid fast (fluids between 120-180 minutes preoperatively) to a standard fasting regimen. On pooling the trials there was little difference in the volume of gastric contents collected from the participants permitted a drink two to three hours preoperatively (n = 526) and those that fasted (n = 395) (WMD -2.05mls CI 95%[-5.59, 1.48]). The pseudo-values for <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK> are still outstanding and though the mean, median and range for the fluid (24.20, 21.00, 0-70mls) and fasted groups (25.70, 23.00, 0-115mls) is available, this data could not be fully presented within the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>04 Fluid (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Eight trials administered an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention to all participants. The drugs administered included ranitidine (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>), famotidine (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>) and roxatidine (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference in volume of gastric contents collected from participants in the experimental shortened fluid fast group (n = 236) and the standard fasting group (n = 175) (WMD -0.19 mls CI 95%[-1.98, 1.60]).</P>
<P>05 Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (No H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Adolescent participants were randomly allocated to a standard fast (n = 76) or unlimited clear fluids up to 180 minutes preoperatively (n = 76) (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>). The results were reported as a percentage of kilogram of body weight, but the mean (and standard deviation) of the group's gastric contents were calculated and presented within the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric contents volume (WMD -3.04 mls CI 95%[-10.34, 4.26]).</P>
<P>06 Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK> randomly allocated young adults (18-49 years of age) to either a standard fast (n = 34) or to drink 360mls of apple juice (n = 19) up to 180 minutes preoperatively. All participants were given a ranitidine co-intervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups volume of gastric contents (WMD 3.00 mls CI 95%[-4.07, 10.07]).</P>
<P>(iii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>All 24 trials that measured gastric content volume (detailed above) also measured participants' gastric pH. Numbers of participants differ between these outcomes as a gastric sample could not always be collected, and so, participants' pH levels could not always be evaluated. A total of 772 participants were permitted a shorter fluid fast while 620 continued a standard preoperative fast. The results are presented in Comparison: 01 Duration - Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH. As with the gastric volume outcome measure presented above, the trials are grouped based on the timing of intake (up to 90 minutes, between 120-180 minutes, up to 180 minutes preoperatively). Using chi-square calculations in RevMan 4.2 there was no evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity between the trials but as pseudo-values were included in the meta-analysis the trial results were pooled using a random effects model.</P>
<P>01 Fluid (up to 90 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of short fluid fast (water up to 90 minutes preoperatively n = 50) and standard fasting regimens (n = 25) in relation to participants' gastric pH. On pooling the results there was no evidence of a difference in pH values between the groups (WMD -0.19, CI 95% [-0.78, 0.40]).</P>
<P>02 Fluid (between 120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast<BR/>Twenty trials evaluated the intake of fluid between 120 and 180 minutes preoperatively by comparing the gastric pH of participants following this shortened fluid fast (n = 633) and a standard fast (n = 499). Pseudo-values were calculated for six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric pH values (WMD 0.14, CI 95% [-0.04, 0.31]).</P>
<P>Some trials however observed much higher pH values than others. For example, the mean gastric pH value for a group that completed a standard fast in one trial was 1.95 (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>), while in a 'sister' trial the group that followed a standard fast were found to have a mean gastric pH of 6.21 (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>). The only difference between these trials was the administration of ranitidine, an H2-receptor antagonist. Similarly high pH values were observed in other trials that included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>). A subgroup analysis was conducted to further examine this issue.</P>
<P>03 Fluid (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (No H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Twelve trials used gastric pH to compare a shortened fluid fast (fluids between 120-180 minutes preoperatively) to a standard fasting regimen but did not include an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention. On pooling the results there was no evidence of a difference in the gastric pH of the participants permitted fluids between two and three hours pre-surgery (n = 429) and those that continued to fast (n = 344) (WMD 0.16, CI 95% [-0.04, 0.35]).</P>
<P>04 Fluid (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Eight trials compared a shortened fluid fast (two to three hours preoperatively) (n = 204) to a standard fast (n = 155) and included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention. Preparations used varied, but included ranitidine (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>), famotidine (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>) and roxatidine (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>). There was no evidence of a between group difference in gastric pH values collected from participants (WMD 0.02, CI 95% [-0.43, 0.47]).</P>
<P>05 Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK> gave 76 adolescent participants (13-19 years) unlimited clear fluids up to 180 minutes preoperatively while another 76 adolescents continued a standard fasting regimen. There was no indication of a difference between the groups' gastric pH values (WMD 0.20, CI 95% [-0.04, 0.44]).</P>
<P>06 Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>One other trial also compared the intake of fluid (apple juice) up to 180 minutes preoperatively (n = 13) to a standard fast (n = 20) (<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric volume (WMD -0.62 mls CI 95%[-2.21, 0.97]).</P>
<P>(iv) Gastric Contents - Marker Dye<BR/>Seven trials compared a short fluid fast (fluid intake between 120-180 minutes preoperatively) to a standard fasting regimen using a variety of non-absorbable marker dyes (cyanocobalamin, phenol red and bromosulphthalein).</P>
<P>Cyanocobalamin<BR/>Two trials used cyanocobalamin (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) to measure and compare the volume of gastric contents of participants' given a drink of water (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>) or carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) (n = 92) between 120 and 180 minutes preoperatively to a group that continued a standard fast (n = 50). Using a fixed effects model there was no indication of a difference between the calculated gastric volume of the participants permitted fluids and those that fasted (WMD -3.50, CI 95% [-14.24, 7.24]). Details are presented in Comparison: 01 Duration - Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 03 Gastric Contents - Cyanocobalamin.</P>
<P>Phenol red<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK> used phenol red as a marker dye but found little indication that the preoperative intake (water, fruit juice, coffee, tea) contributed to participants' intra-operative gastric contents. In only six of the 57 participants was the percentage of marker dye collected greater than 5%. Additional summary data were not available for presentation within a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Bromosulphthalein [BSP]<BR/>01 Fluids (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast<BR/>Four trials used the marker bromosulphthalein [BSP] and participants were randomised to either a standard fasting regimen (n = 120) or a fasting regimen that permitted water up to 120-180 minutes preoperatively (n = 120) (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>). The results were pooled and can be referred to in Comparison: 01 Duration - Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 04 Gastric Contents - BSP. There was no evidence of a difference in the amount of marker dye detected intra-operatively (WMD -0.08, CI 95% [-0.27, 0.10]). The concentrations of marker dye detected were noted to be very small across all groups and in some cases these values were so low they were not estimable for meta-analysis purposes, especially amongst those trials that did not include an H2-receptor antagonist intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>). Trials that did and did not include an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention were presented separately.</P>
<P>02 Fluids (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Participants were randomised to receive 150 mls of water 120-180 minutes preoperatively (n = 60) or continue fasting (n = 60) in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>). The concentrations of preoperatively ingested marker dye were so low that the results could not be estimated for meta-analysis purposes.</P>
<P>03 Fluids (120-180 minutes preoperatively) v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Interestingly, only participants administered an H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine co-intervention had sufficient concentrations of marker dye recovered for meta-analysis purposes (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>). Both trials compared the intake of 150mls of water (n = 60) to a standard fasting regimen (n = 60). There was a clear indication of heterogeneity (p &lt; 0.0001) and possible sources explored included the slightly different participant populations. One trial recruited females undergoing a first trimester abortion (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>) while the other recruited the general elective surgical adult population (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>). The timing of the collection of gastric contents also differed slightly between the trial with one described as post induction (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>) while the other collection occurred following surgery (detailed as occurring approximately 10 minutes after induction) (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>). These differences were not perceived to be of significance prior to pooling. On pooling the data there was no indication of a significant between group difference (WMD -0.08, CI 95% [-0.27, 0.10]). See Comparison: 01 Duration - Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 04 Gastric Contents - BSP for details.</P>
<P>(v) Secondary Outcomes<BR/>19 of the total 38 comparisons included in this systematic review compared a shortened fluid fast to a standard fast by measuring thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety which were classified for the purposes of this review as secondary outcome measures. The results of these comparisons are described below. Additional information relating to the method of measurement and the comparisons made is available in <LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK> Duration of Fast - Secondary Outcome Measures. A key to the information presented in this table is available in <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>.</P>
<P>§ Thirst<BR/>Participants' thirst was measured in 18 trials that compared a shortened fluid fast to a standard preoperative fasting regimen. The thirst measurement methods employed varied from visual analogue scales and 3 or 4 point rating scales. Three trials focused on postoperative thirst (time point g) (see <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK> for key) while the remaining 14 measured preoperative thirst (time point a to f). Details of the tools used and the timing of measures are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK> - Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Thirst.</P>
<P>The two trials that compared fluid intake up to 90 minutes preoperatively with a standard fasting regimen found that between admission and induction all groups recorded a reduction in thirst and dryness of mouth (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>). Postoperatively there was no difference in thirst between the groups.</P>
<P>Fourteen trials evaluated participants' thirst while they compared the intake of fluid 120 - 180 mins preoperatively to a standard fasting regimen. Using a variety of tools at various measurement time points (see <LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK> for details) more of the standard fasting groups recorded increased thirst over the preoperative period or rated their thirst as greater than the groups permitted some fluid intake. Additionally, the groups permitted fluid intake recorded more decreased thirst scores or rated their thirst as less severe than the fasting group. There were some cases however where there was no indication of a difference between the groups' descriptions of thirst (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>) and similarly, those that measured postoperative thirst found no indication of a between group difference. There was little to suggest that this pattern varied amongst the trials that administered an H2 receptor-antagonist co-intervention and those that did not.</P>
<P>§ Hunger<BR/>Fifteen trials compared a shortened fluid fasting regimen to a standard fasting regimen, by measuring participants' perception of hunger. Measuring tools employed included a VAS and various four point scales. Details of these measurement tools and timing of data collection can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Hunger.</P>
<P>Thirteen trials compared a standard fast with one that allowed fluid intake between 120-180 minutes preoperatively. All addressed participants' pre-operative hunger. Four trials found that more participants permitted a drink preoperatively described a decrease in hunger over the preoperative period, than those that were fasted (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). In the remaining nine trials however there was no difference between the groups' ratings of hunger. These conflicting results may reflect the questionable impact a fluid based intervention might have on participants' perception of hunger, differences in the method of measuring hunger (see <LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK>) or the type of fluids administered to the intervention group. For example, a decrease was noted in the hunger ratings of participants permitted a carbohydrate drink unlike the participants that fasted who reported increasing hunger (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). This between group difference however was not evident amongst the trials that administered water (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>) or an isotonic drink to the experimental group (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>). It is also possible that the H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention may have influenced the participants' reports of hunger as trials that included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention found no difference between the shortened fluid fast and the standard fasting groups' ratings of hunger (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Hunger.</P>
<P>Two trials measured hunger ratings by participants that were permitted fluids up to 180 minutes preoperatively and those that continued a standard fasting regimen, using a VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>). There was no indication that the experimental and fasted groups differed in their ratings of preoperative hunger. See <LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Hunger.</P>
<P>§ Pain<BR/>Five trials evaluated pain either preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) or postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). Pain scores overall were reported to be low. Details can been seen in <LINK REF="TBL-18" TYPE="TABLE">Table 18</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Pain. Two trials that measured participants' report of postoperative sore throat (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>) found no difference between the groups rating of pain. Of the three trials that measured pain in the groups permitted fluids between 120-180 minutes preoperatively and those that fasted (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) only Goodwin found a single significant difference. The participants who had fasted reported less pain at 60 minutes post surgery (one of six different postoperative measurement points) than those permitted a drink of water or an orange drink 120-180 minutes preoperatively.</P>
<P>§ Nausea<BR/>Eight trials compared a standard preoperative fasting regimen to one that permitted fluid intake by evaluating participants' nausea preoperatively or postoperatively. Participants' reports of nausea were collected at a range of different time points. Methods of evaluation varied from asking participants whether they experienced/were experiencing nausea to completion of a VAS. In one case the presence of nausea was noted but it is unclear whether this was by patient report or through staff observation (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>). Few differences between the groups' experience of nausea were found and many researchers noted the low incidence of nausea. Only <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK> found a significant increase in nausea ratings over the preoperative period within a group permitted 400mls of water preoperatively. See <LINK REF="TBL-19" TYPE="TABLE">Table 19</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Nausea.</P>
<P>§ Vomiting<BR/>Four trials evaluated postoperative vomiting using a VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) or a Yes/No question (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>) while one (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>) noted its occurrence preoperatively. There was no difference in the incidence of vomiting between the groups following a standard fast and groups permitted fluids and there is some indication that it was not a common occurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>). These details are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-20" TYPE="TABLE">Table 20</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast v Standard Fast - Vomiting.</P>
<P>§ Anxiety<BR/>''Anxiety' was broadly measured as an outcome in six trials that compared a shortened fluid fast to a standard fast. Studies addressed participants' ratings of anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>), dry mouth (later described in the text as a measure of anxiety) (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>) and nervousness (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>). The methods used to measure these outcomes varied (see <LINK REF="TBL-21" TYPE="TABLE">Table 21</LINK> for details). The trials evaluating the intake of water 90 minutes preoperatively found that participants permitted 150mls of water reported reduced anxiety over the preoperative period but those permitted a larger volume (300-450mls) did not differ from participants following the standard fasting regimen in their description of anxiety.</P>
<P>There was no difference between the groups' rating of dry mouth (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>) despite the experimental group having unlimited water intake up to 120-180 minutes preoperatively but they did report lower levels of immediate preoperative nervousness than the group that were fasted in the standard fashion. Similarly, the group permitted a preoperative carbohydrate drink in the same time frame (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) recorded a decrease in preoperative anxiety and made significantly lower ratings of anxiety than the group that followed the standard fasting routine. Interestingly, this pattern was not evident amongst the group that was randomised to receive a placebo drink (water) (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intake of a relatively large volume of water (500-1000mls) up to 180 minutes preoperatively was compared to a standard preoperative fasting regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>). An H2-receptor antagonist was also administered and participants were asked rate their well-being compared to (i) pre-admission and (ii) previous anaesthetics. There was no difference between the groups in relation to their well-being compared to pre-admission, though more of the group that were given a drink compared their well-being favourably to their well-being during previous anaesthetics. <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK> however qualitatively reported that some participants allocated to the intake of 450mls of water voiced disquiet at the unusually large volume of fluid they were required to drink.</P>
<P>(b) DURATION - SHORTENED SOLID FAST v STANDARD FAST<BR/>The two trials that compared a standard fasting regimen with a fast from solid food of a shorter duration will be presented below in relation to the outcomes used to measure the effectiveness of the fasting regimen. No trial reported aspiration/regurgitation but measures used include (i) gastric contents - volume, and (ii) gastric contents - pH. No trial evaluated an experimental shortened solid fasting regimen using a marker dye or by measuring the secondary outcomes of thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting or anxiety.</P>
<P>(i) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>Two small trials compared a shortened solid fast (n = 23) to a standard fasting regimen (n = 22) by measuring gastric content volume (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983b</LINK>). The participants in the experimental group were permitted a preoperative breakfast (one slice buttered toast and tea). The interval between the intake of breakfast and the induction of anaesthesia was a mean of 249 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983a</LINK>) and of 199 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983b</LINK>). Using a fixed effects model the results from the standard fasting (n = 22) and the shortened solid fast groups (n = 23) were pooled. There was no difference between the groups' gastric content volume (WMD 0.88ml CI 95% [-7.68, 9.44]). See Comparison: 02 Duration - Shortened Solid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 01 Gastric Contents - Volume for details.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983b</LINK> also evaluated a shortened solid fast and a standard fasting regimen by comparing the pH of participants' intra-operative gastric contents. Gastric pH values were only available from an even smaller number of fasting (n = 13) and fed (n= 17) participants. Pseudo-mean and SD values were calculated to allow presentation of the trials' results within a meta-analysis. On pooling the data there was no indication of a significant difference in the groups' gastric content pH (WMD -1.15ml CI 95% [-4.09, 1.79]). See Comparison: 02 Duration - Shortened Solid Fast v Standard Fast; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>There was some indication of heterogeneity which is likely to be the result of the narcotic and anti-cholinergic premedication co-interventions administered in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983a</LINK>). This trial showed no difference between the fasted and fed groups' gastric pH. The second trial administered a non-narcotic premedication co-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1983b</LINK>) and found the group that remained fasting had a significantly higher gastric pH than those participants permitted breakfast.</P>
<P>(c) DURATION - SHORTENED SOLID FAST v SHORTENED FLUID FAST<BR/>One trial compared a shortened solid fasting regimen to a shortened fluid fasting regimen. The incidence of aspiration/regurgitation was not addressed but (i) gastric contents - volume, (ii) gastric contents - pH and (iii) the secondary outcomes of thirst and hunger were measured. A gastric marker dye was not used nor were the secondary outcomes of pain, nausea, vomiting or anxiety considered.</P>
<P>(i) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>Participants were randomly allocated to either the intake of a preoperative breakfast (two slices of bread and jam + 250mls of an isotonic drink/apple juice) (n = 20) or the intake of fluid alone (250mls of an isotonic drink/apple juice) (n = 20) (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK>). The mean breakfast to induction interval was 330 minutes (SD = 33) and the mean drink to induction interval was 364 minutes (SD = 48). The intake to induction interval was significantly shorter for the breakfasting group than the fluid group (p = &lt; 0.05). There was no evidence of a between group difference in the volume of gastric contents collected (WMD -1.70 ml CI 95%[-12.44, 9.04]). See Comparison: 03 Duration - Shortened Solid Fast v Shortened Fluid Fast; Outcome 01 Gastric Contents - Volume for details.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1997</LINK> also compared the pH of the gastric contents of a group permitted a shortened solid fast (breakfast) (n = 20) and a group permitted a shortened fluid fast preoperatively (n = 20). As highlighted above, there was a significant difference between the groups' mean ingestion and induction of anaesthesia interval. There was no evidence the two groups' intra-operative gastric pH values differed (WMD 0.30 CI 95%[-1.13, 1.73]). Comparison: 03 Duration - Shortened Solid Fast v Shortened Fluid Fast; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH for details.</P>
<P>(iii) Secondary Outcomes<BR/>Participants' thirst and hunger were evaluated before induction of anaesthesia to compare a group permitted a light breakfast (including a drink) and those only permitted a drink. Four point rating scales of thirst and hunger were used (see <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK> for details). No between group differences were found in the groups' ratings of thirst or hunger.</P>
<P>For summary of Duration of Fast Results - see end of results section.</P>
<P>2. TYPE OF PERMITTED INTAKE<BR/>While there has been a recent move towards shortening the duration of the nil by mouth preoperative fast (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>), guidelines recommend a period of restricted intake which raises the issue of the type of intake permitted during the restricted fasting period. This section examines the evidence in relation to this issue. As planned at the protocol stage, two subgroup analyses were conducted which examine (a) Fluid Intake Permitted v Standard Fast and (b) Fluid 1 v Fluid 2. Each comparative analysis is presented in relation to the outcomes used to measure the effectiveness of the experimental fasting regimen, namely (i) aspiration/regurgitation (ii) volume of gastric contents, (ii) pH of gastric contents, (iii) marker dye measures of gastric contents and (iv) secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>(a) FLUID INTAKE V STANDARD FAST<BR/>(i) Aspiration/Regurgitation<BR/>None of the seven trials that compared a standard fast to the intake of water, clear fluids, a carbohydrate drink or a choice of water or orange reported any aspiration or regurgitation incident amongst the participants. Goodwin however appears to confine this report to the intervention group. See <LINK REF="TBL-24" TYPE="TABLE">Table 24</LINK> Type of Intake - Aspiration/Regurgitation for details.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>The 23 trials presented in this section compared a shortened fluid fast to a standard fasting regimen but the results are presented in a format that permits examination of the evidence relating to the various types of fluid permitted preoperatively. Fluids permitted during the restricted fasting period included water, coffee, fruit juice (apple or orange), clear fluids, a carbohydrate drink and an isotonic drink and were compared to a standard fasting regimen. The summary statistics for five trials were based on pseudo-values (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>). A conservative approach was taken to pooling this data and a random effects model was used. The results can be referred to in Comparison: 04 Type of Intake - Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 1 Gastric Contents - Volume.</P>
<P>Fourteen trials permitted the preoperative intake of water. Mean and standard deviation data was unavailable for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>). The pseudo-values for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1994</LINK>) are still outstanding but pseudo-mean and pseudo-standard deviation values were calculated for the remaining three trials and included in the meta-analysis. On pooling the data it was evident that a statistically significant lower volume of intra-operative gastric contents were collected from the participants permitted preoperative water (n = 440) than those following the traditional fasting regimen (n = 417) (p = 0.02 WMD -2.51 mls CI 95% [-4.60, -0.42]). It should be noted that while a significant between group difference was evident the difference itself was modest and is considered clinically insignificant.</P>
<P>All but two of the fourteen trials presented here found the participants that followed a standard fast had a higher intra-operative gastric volume than those participants that drank water preoperatively. Both trials that found the opposite pattern (i.e. the fasted group had a lower intra-operative gastric volume) had included a ranitidine co-intervention. On closer examination, other trials that administered a similar H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention reported low gastric contents volume across groups. This aspect was explored further in a post hoc subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>02 Water v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>As detailed above, the <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK> data presented within the meta-analysis is based on pseudo-values while similar calculations are awaited for the <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK> data. Nine trials examined whether participants permitted a preoperative drink of water (n = 319) had a lower volume of gastric contents on induction of anaesthesia than those participants that followed a standard fasting regimen (n = 292). This difference was highly statistically significant (p = 0.00002, WMD -6.16 mls CI 95%[-9.41, -2.91]) but is not considered clinically significant.</P>
<P>03 Water v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Five trials included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention in their comparison of a short water fast (n = 121) and a standard fasting regimen (n = 125). Co-intervention preparations included ranitidine (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>), famotidine (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>) and roxatidine (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>). Pseudo-values were calculated for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>). There was no indication of a difference between the groups' volume of gastric contents (WMD -0.71 mls CI 95%[-2.55, 1.13]).</P>
<P>04 Coffee [+ milk on request] v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK> randomised some participants (n = 50) to receive a cup of coffee (with milk if requested), while the remainder (n = 50) continued a standard fast. There was no evidence of a difference in the volume of gastric contents between groups (WMD 1.30 mls, CI 95% [-6.37, 8.97]).</P>
<P>05 Coffee [+ milk on request] v Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK> also compared the gastric content volume of participants permitted coffee preoperatively (n = 50) and those that continued a standard fast (n = 50) but all participants also received a ranitidine co-intervention. There was no difference between the groups' intra-operative gastric volume (WMD 4.60 mls, CI 95% [-0.92, 10.12]).</P>
<P>06 Fruit Juice v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Participants' gastric volume was measured to compare the preoperative intake of orange juice (n = 50) to a standard fast (n = 50) in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>), but there was no indication of a difference between the groups (WMD 0.50 mls, CI 95% [-6.50,7.50]).</P>
<P>07 Fruit Juice v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Two trials measured gastric content volume in order to compare participants' preoperative intake of orange (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>) or apple juice (<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>) (n = 69) to a standard fast (n = 84). Ranitidine was administered as a preoperative co-intervention. On pooling the data there was no evidence of a between group difference in gastric volume (WMD 4.24 mls, CI 95% [-0.27, 8.76]).</P>
<P>08 Other Fluids v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Four trials asked participants in the intervention groups (n = 233) to drink various other types of fluids during the preoperative period - a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>), clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>) or offered participants the choice of water, fruit juice, coffee or tea (Maltby 1988). Control participants (n = 237) continued fasting. Pseudo-values were calculated for two trial data (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>). On pooling the data there was no evidence of a between group difference in gastric volume (WMD 2.19 mls, CI 95% [-0.63, 5.00]).</P>
<P>09 Other Fluids v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>In Yatsu 1996b participants were randomised to received a preoperative isotonic drink (n = 15) or to fast (n = 15). Both groups were prescribed roxatidine an H2-receptor antagonist. There was no indication of a between group difference in gastric volume. It should be noted that participant numbers in each group were very small and methods of randomisation employed were unclear and blinding was considered inadequate. (WMD -4.60 mls, CI 95% [9.62, -0.42]).</P>
<P>(iii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>Twenty-three trials, involving 1479 participants, compared the intake of water, coffee, fruit juice, clear fluids, a carbohydrate drink and an isotonic drink to a standard fasting regimen by measuring gastric pH. The data was pooled using a random effects model and details are presented in Comparison 04 Type of Intake - Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>01 Water v Standard Fast<BR/>Fourteen trials evaluated the preoperative intake of water (n = 381) to a standard fast (n = 361) by measuring the pH of the participants' intra-operative gastric contents. Pseudo-values were calculated for four trials' data (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>). Following pooling there was no evidence that gastric pH of participants that drank water preoperatively differed significantly from the pH levels of participants that fasted (WMD 0.09 CI 95% [-0.10, 0.29]). We explored the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on gastric pH in a sub group analysis.</P>
<P>02 Water v Standard Fast (No H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Nine trials randomly allocated participants to either the intake of water (n = 271) or a traditional fast (n = 246) and none included a H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention. There was no evidence of a between group difference in gastric pH values (WMD 0.07 CI 95% [-0.15, 0.28]). It is of note that the one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>) that found a significant difference between the groups' gastric pH also noted a significant difference between the mean weight of the randomised groups. While the methods of random sequence generation and concealment of allocation were considered adequate, the group permitted a preoperative drink were significantly heavier than the group that fasted.</P>
<P>03 Water v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Five trials prescribed an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention for participants given water preoperatively (n = 110) and those that fasted (n = 115). Pseudo-values were calculated for two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>) and then included within the meta-analysis. On pooling, there was no indication of a between-group difference in pH values (WMD 0.28 CI 95% [-0.25, 0.82]).</P>
<P>04 Coffee [+ milk on request] v Standard Fast (No H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK> evaluated intra-operative gastric pH amongst participants that drank a preoperative cup of coffee (n = 49) or continued fasting (n = 49). There was no significant difference between the groups' gastric pH values (WMD 0.23 CI 95% [-0.34, 0.80]).</P>
<P>05 Coffee [+ milk on request] v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK> also compared the preoperative intake of coffee (n = 42) with the standard fasting regimen (n = 40) but also included a ranitidine co-intervention. There was no significant difference between the groups gastric pH (WMD -0.56 CI 95% [-1.35, 0.23]).</P>
<P>06 Fruit Juice v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK> compared the intake of orange juice (n = 46) and a standard fast (n = 49) and found no difference between the groups' post induction gastric pH values (WMD 0.00 CI 95% [-0.50, 0.50]).</P>
<P>07 Fruit Juice v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK> compared the intake of fruit juice (orange n = 37; apple n = 13) to a continued fast (n = 40; n = 20 respectively) by measuring participants' intra-operative gastric pH. All participants were given an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention. The groups permitted fruit juice had a significantly lower intra-operative gastric pH than those groups that fasted in the standard way (WMD -0.76 CI 95% [-1.50, -0.03]) (p = 0.04).</P>
<P>08 Other Fluids v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>The preoperative intake of a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>), clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>) or a choice of water, fruit juice, coffee or tea (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>) was compared to a standard fasting regimen. Pseudo-values were calculated for two trials to allow presentation within the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>). Using a random effects model to pool the data, the intake of these various fluids resulted in significantly higher gastric pH values than the gastric pH of participants that followed a standard fast (WMD 0.21 CI 95%[0.00, 0.42]). Though the groups' pH values are significantly different (p = 0.04) the between group difference was marginal (0.2 of a pH) and not considered of clinical significance.</P>
<P>09 Other Fluids v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK> compared the intake of 150 mls of an isotonic sports drink (n = 15) with a standard fast (n = 15) and also prescribed roxatidine, an H2-receptor antagonist to all participants. There was no difference between the groups' gastric pH (WMD 0.8 CI 95%[-0.65, 2.25]).</P>
<P>(iv) Gastric Contents - Marker Dye<BR/>Various marker dyes were used to measure the gastric contents. The results in relation to each of the three marker dyes used, namely cyanocobalamin, phenol red and bromosulphthalein, will be presented below.</P>
<P>Cyanocobalamin<BR/>Two trials compared the intake of water (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>) (n = 50) or a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) (n = 50) to a standard fast (n = 100) by measuring intra-operative gastric content volume using cyanocobalamin. Neither found any evidence of a difference between the fasted and fluid groups (WMD -3.00ml CI 95%[-12.26, 6.26] and WMD -4.00ml CI 95%[-13.03, 5.03] respectively). These results are presented in Comparison 04 Type of Intake - Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 03 Gastric Contents - Cyanocobalamin.</P>
<P>Phenol Red<BR/>As reported earlier, <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK> used phenol red as a marker dye but suggested that the preoperative intake of a variety of fluids (i.e. giving participants a choice of water, fruit juice, coffee or tea) contributed little to intra-operative gastric contents. Only a small proportion of the 57 participants included in the trial had more than 5% marked dye collected. Additional summary data was unavailable.</P>
<P>Bromosulphthalein [BSP]<BR/>01 Water v Standard Fast<BR/>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>) employed BSP as a marker dye to compare the preoperative intake of water (n = 120) with a standard fasting regimen (n = 120). Low concentrations of marker dye were found in gastric samples recovered from the groups. Values were so low in trials that did not include an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention, the weighted mean difference was not estimable. See Comparison 04 Type of Intake - Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 04 Gastric Contents - BSP. The trials that administered a ranitidine co-intervention were presented separately from those that did not.</P>
<P>02 Water v Standard Fast (No H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK> evaluated the concentration of the preoperatively ingested marker dye BSP to compare the gastric contents of participants permitted water preoperatively (n = 60) and those that continued a normal fasting regimen (n = 60). Traces of marker dye were so low in concentration a weighted mean difference could not be estimated on pooling the data.</P>
<P>03 Water v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>) compared the intake of water (n = 60) to a standard fasting regimen (n = 60). All participants also received the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine preoperatively. Evidence of significant heterogeneity between these trials (p &lt; 0.00001) still remains. Possible sources of heterogeneity are difficult to identify - both trials compare the intake of similar volume of water (150 or 160mls) to a standard fasting regimen and employed similar methods of randomisation, allocation of participants and blinding. One difference noted are the different populations targeted for recruitment. <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK> recruited females undergoing a first trimester abortion while <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK> recruited adults (18-60 years) attending elective surgery. <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK> described the gastric contents sampling as occurring post induction while Sutherland collected the gastric contents within 10 minutes of induction. On pooling the results using a random effects model there was no evidence of a difference between groups (WMD -0.08, CI 95% [-0.27, 0.10]).</P>
<P>04-06 No trial compared the preoperative intake of coffee, fruit juice or other fluids to a standard fasting regimen by evaluating gastric contents using a marker dye.</P>
<P>(v) Secondary Outcomes<BR/>An overview of the 25 trials that compared the intake of fluids to a standard fasting regimen by measuring the secondary outcomes of thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-25" TYPE="TABLE">Table 25</LINK> Type of Intake - Secondary Outcome Measures. This table also includes details of the measurement tools used and the timing of measurements made.</P>
<P>§ Thirst<BR/>Participants' thirst was evaluated in 18 different trials that compared the intake of a preoperative fluid to a standard fast. Methods of measurement varied from a VAS to 3 or 4 point rating scales and the timing of measures ranged from preoperative to postoperatively. Details can be seen in <LINK REF="TBL-26" TYPE="TABLE">Table 26</LINK> Type of Fluid v Standard Fast - Thirst for details. Some trials took more than one measure of thirst asking participants to record both thirst and dry mouth (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten trials compared the intake of water to a standard fast and many found the participants permitted water reported a greater decrease in their thirst over the preoperative period than those following a standard fasting regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>). Some fasted groups recorded a greater increase in thirst scores over time than those permitted water (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>). Unsurprisingly, participants permitted water reported less thirst than those that fasted (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>). Some trials found no evidence of a difference in the groups' ratings of thirst (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>) despite, in some cases, using four different measures of thirst (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials evaluating the intake of other types of fluid made similar findings. Those participants' permitted the preoperative intake of clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>), coffee (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>), orange juice (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>), water/orange (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>) or a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) reported less thirst or a preoperative decrease in thirst than the groups that remained fasting. Conversely, the fasting groups reported increasing preoperative thirst over the preoperative period. Only <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK> failed to find any difference between the groups' reported thirst (isotonic drink v fast), though their descriptions of thirst may have been influenced by the roxatidine (H2-receptor antagonist) co-intervention.</P>
<P>§ Hunger<BR/>Fifteen trials measured participants' perception of their hunger during a standard fasting regimen and a regimen that permitted some fluid intervention during the fasting period. All but one (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) measured pre-operative hunger. Measuring tools used included VAS and various four point scales. See <LINK REF="TBL-27" TYPE="TABLE">Table 27</LINK> Type of Fluid v Standard Fast - Hunger for details. Overall there was little indication that the groups differed in their description of hunger perioperatively. Where a between group difference was noted participants who drank 150mls of water, coffee, orange juice or 400mls of a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) described a decrease in hunger while two fasted groups reported an increase in hunger (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). The presence of a H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention may have had an impact on participants' report of hunger as all the trials that included this co-intervention found no difference between the groups' ratings of hunger.</P>
<P>§ Pain<BR/>Pain was measured by five trials that compared the preoperative intake of water, water/orange drink or a carbohydrate drink to a standard fasting regimen. Two trials addressed participants' ratings of sore throat (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>). Between group differences were rare with only one trial finding that participants that had maintained a standard preoperative fast reported less pain 60 minutes postoperatively (one of six postoperative data collection points) than the participants permitted a preoperative drink of water/orange (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>). Details can been seen in <LINK REF="TBL-28" TYPE="TABLE">Table 28</LINK> Type of Fluid v Standard Fast - Pain.</P>
<P>§ Nausea<BR/>Nausea was measured by eight trials pre- or postoperatively between one and six different time points. Measurement tools varied from noting the presence of nausea, asking participants whether they experienced/were experiencing nausea to a VAS. Details can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-29" TYPE="TABLE">Table 29</LINK> Type of Fluid v Standard Fast - Nausea. There was little indication of a difference between the groups' experience of nausea regardless of whether the preoperative fluid intervention was a drink of water, water/orange or a carbohydrate drink. Two trials commented on the generally limited incidence (or in some cases complete absence of) nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>). The only exception to this was one of the seven intervention groups permitted water preoperatively reported increasing nausea over the preoperative period while ratings of nausea amongst the participants randomly allocated to a standard fast remained constant (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>§ Vomiting<BR/>Vomiting was addressed within five trials that compared the intake of water to a standard fasting regimen. Preoperative vomiting was noted while postoperative vomiting was evaluated using a VAS or a Yes/No question. There was no difference in the incidence of vomiting between the fasting and fluid groups and reference was made to the rarity of its occurrence. See <LINK REF="TBL-30" TYPE="TABLE">Table 30</LINK> Type of Fluid v Standard Fast - Vomiting for details.</P>
<P>§ Anxiety<BR/>Six trials measured outcomes that have been grouped here for presentation purposes as measures of 'anxiety'. Trials presented within this category reported measures of anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>), dry mouth (described as a measure of anxiety) (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>), well-being (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) and nervousness (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>). All but one (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) employed a VAS and asked participants to report preoperatively. Five of the trials compared a standard fasting regimen to one that permitted various volumes of water preoperatively while one trial evaluated a carbohydrate drink intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). Details can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-31" TYPE="TABLE">Table 31</LINK> Type of Fluid v Standard Fast - Anxiety.</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>) found no difference between the groups' ratings of anxiety over time, though Read 1991's participants were describing 'dry mouth' which could be linked to their perception of thirst. The group permitted a carbohydrate drink recorded a reduced anxiety preoperatively and (following the intervention) less anxiety than the fasting group (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). Similarly, participants permitted water were less anxious (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>), less nervous (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>) and reported feeling better postoperatively (compared to previous anaesthetics) (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) than the fasted group. Differences were not evident across all studies with some finding no difference between groups' reports of anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>) or a difference in reports of well-being pre-admission (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>(a) TYPE OF PERMITTED INTAKE - FLUID 1 V FLUID 2<BR/>Five trials directly compared the preoperative intake of two different types of fluids during a shortened fluid fast. The outcomes measured included (i) aspiration/regurgitation, (ii) gastric content volume, (iii) gastric content pH, (iv) marker dye and (v) secondary outcome measures of thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety.</P>
<P>(i) Aspiration/Regurgitation<BR/>One trial that compared the intake of water (n= 80) and a carbohydrate drink (n = 86) during a restricted fasting period (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK>) reported that no aspiration or other drink-related complications were observed. See <LINK REF="TBL-24" TYPE="TABLE">Table 24</LINK> Type of Intake - Aspiration/Regurgitation for details.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>Two different types of preoperative fluid intake were directly compared by five trials. A fixed effects model was used to pool the data in Comparison: 05 Type of Intake - Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2]; Outcome 01 Gastric Contents - Volume.</P>
<P>01 Orange Juice [F1] v Coffee [F2] (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988e" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988e</LINK> compared the preoperative intake of orange juice (n = 50) to coffee (n = 50) by measuring participants gastric volume during surgery. There was no indication of a difference between the groups (WMD -0.80mls CI 95% [-8.66, 7.06])</P>
<P>02 Orange Juice [F1] v Coffee [F2] (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988f" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988f</LINK> also compared the preoperative intake of orange juice (n = 50) to coffee (n = 50) but included ranitidine (an H2-receptor antagonist) co-intervention. Similarly, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups volume of intra-operative gastric contents (WMD 0.05 mls CI 95% [-5.86, 6.86]).</P>
<P>03 Apple Juice [F1] v Assam Tea [F2] (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>The gastric content volume of participants given apple juice (n = 20) was compared to the volume of gastric content of those given Assam tea (n = 20) (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>). All participants were administered roxatidine, an H2-receptor antagonist. Interestingly, the group that drank apple juice had a significantly higher volume of gastric content at induction of anaesthesia than the group that drank tea (p = 0.02, WMD 10.70mls CI 95%[1.82, 19.58]). It should be noted however that the randomisation and blinding procedures were not reported and so the methodological quality of this trial was difficult to judge.</P>
<P>04 Water [F1] v Carbohydrate Drink [F2] (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK> compared the preoperative intake of water (n = 84) with a carbohydrate drink (n = 78). There was no indication of a difference between the groups' gastric content volumes (WMD - 4.00 mls CI 95%[-15.11, 7.11]).</P>
<P>05 Water [F1] v Isotonic Drink [F2] (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>The preoperative intake of water (n = 15) or an isotonic drink (n = 15) were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996c" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996c</LINK> by measuring the volume of participants' intra-operative gastric contents. There was no indication of a difference between the groups (WMD 1.70 mls CI 95%[-2.59, 5.99]).</P>
<P>(iii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>The preoperative intake of two different types of fluid during a period of restricted fasting were compared using measures of participants' gastric pH by five trials. A fixed effects model was used to pool the data in Comparison: 05 Type of Intake - Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2]; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>01 Orange Juice [F1] v Coffee [F2] (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988e" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988e</LINK> compared the preoperative intake of orange juice (n = 46) to coffee (n = 49) and found no difference between the groups' intra-operative gastric pH (WMD - 0.23 CI 95%[-0.80, 0.34]).</P>
<P>02 Orange Juice [F1] v Coffee [F2] (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>A second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988f" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988f</LINK>) also compared the preoperative intake of orange juice (n = 37) to coffee (n = 42) and also found no between group difference in gastric pH (WMD - 0.24 CI 95%[-1.18, 0.70]). All participants within this trial were administered a ranitidine co-intervention.</P>
<P>03 Apple Juice v Assam Tea (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Twenty participants were randomly allocated to drink 150mls of apple juice and an additional 20 to Assam tea preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>). Roxatidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, was also administered to all participants. Gastric pH was significantly higher amongst the group that drank Assam tea than the group that drank apple juice (p = 0.04 WMD -1.60, CI 95% [-3.09, -0.11]). Details on the randomisation or blinding procedures employed within the study were unavailable.</P>
<P>04 Water v Carbohydrate Drink (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK> compared the preoperative intake of water (n = 45) to a carbohydrate drink (n = 40) but found no difference in the groups' gastric pH values (WMD -0.10, CI 95% [-0.78, 0.58]).</P>
<P>05 Water v Isotonic Drink (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>The preoperative intake of 150mls of water (n = 15) and an isotonic drink (n = 15) were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996c" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996c</LINK>. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric pH (WMD -0.90, CI 95% [-2.39, 0.59]).</P>
<P>(iv) Gastric Contents - Marker Dye<BR/>01 Water v Carbohydrate Drink<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK> calculated the intra-operative gastric contents of participants given water (n = 50) or a carbohydrate drink (n = 42) preoperatively using the marker dye cyanocobalamin. There was no indication of a difference between the groups' gastric volume using cyanocobalamin (WMD 1.00, CI 95% [-6.97, 8.97]). See Comparison: 05 Type of Intake - Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2]; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - Cyanocobalamin for details.</P>
<P>(v) Secondary Outcomes<BR/>§ Thirst<BR/>Five trials measured participants' report of thirst using either a VAS or a four point rating scale. As might be expected, there was little indication of a difference in ratings of thirst between groups' that had coffee or orange juice (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988e" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988e</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988f" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988f</LINK>), apple juice or Assam tea (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>) and water or an isotonic drink (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996c" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996c</LINK>). Interestingly, at one of the four preoperative data collection points participants that drank a preoperative carbohydrate drink were less thirsty than those participants who were randomly administered water placebo. In addition, the group who had a carbohydrate drink reported a decrease in their preoperative thirst while those that drank water did not report any change over the preoperative period (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK>). Details are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-32" TYPE="TABLE">Table 32</LINK> Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2] - Thirst.</P>
<P>§ Hunger<BR/>Five trials examined preoperative levels of hunger amongst participants' given different drinks during a preoperative period of restricted intake. There was little indication of a difference between the groups' hunger regardless of whether they drank coffee or orange juice (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988f" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988f</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988e" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988e</LINK>), Assam tea or apple juice (<LINK REF="STD-Tanabe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tanabe 1996</LINK>), an isotonic drink or water (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996c" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996c</LINK>). Again, only one trial found that the type of intake had an impact on participants' reports of hunger (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK>). At three separate preoperative data collection time points (d and e x 2) the group administered a carbohydrate drink described less hunger than the group administered flavoured water. The carbohydrate group also recorded lower hunger ratings over the preoperative period while the water group's ratings did not change. See <LINK REF="TBL-33" TYPE="TABLE">Table 33</LINK> Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2] - Hunger.</P>
<P>§ Nausea<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK> compared the intake of water and a carbohydrate drink by evaluating participants' ratings of nausea on a VAS. The participants that had a drink of water preoperatively reported increasing nausea over the preoperative period but there was no significant difference between the two groups' ratings of nausea. <LINK REF="TBL-34" TYPE="TABLE">Table 34</LINK> Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2] - Nausea for details.</P>
<P>§ Vomiting - Pain<BR/>No trial directly evaluated two different types of preoperative fluid intake by measuring pain or vomiting</P>
<P>§ Anxiety<BR/>Participants were asked to rate their anxiety on a VAS at four different preoperative time points (a, d, e x2 - see <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK> for key) within <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001c</LINK>. The group given a carbohydrate drink described a decrease in anxiety over the preoperative period and scored their anxiety as less than the group that drank water preoperatively. Details are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-35" TYPE="TABLE">Table 35</LINK> Fluid 1 [F1] v Fluid 2 [F2] - Anxiety.</P>

<P>3. VOLUME OF PERMITTED INTAKE<BR/>In evaluating various preoperative fasting regimens, the optimum volume of intake permitted during a restricted preoperative fasting period (if intake is permitted) was also considered by a total of 26 trials. These trials compared several different volumes of intake to a standard fast, or to a different volume of intake. For analysis purposes the various volumes permitted preoperatively were categorised into three types of intake; low volume (less than or equal to 150mls), high volume (more than 150mls) and unlimited volumes (where no restriction was placed on the volume of participants' preoperative fluid intake). As planned at the protocol stage two subgroup analyses were conducted to examine (a) Volume of Intake v Standard Fast and (b) Volume 1 v Volume 2. Each analysis was considered in relation to (i) aspiration/regurgitation, (ii) volume of gastric contents, (iii) pH of gastric contents, (iv) marker dye measures of gastric contents and (v) secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>(a) Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>(i) Aspiration/Regurgitation<BR/>No aspiration or regurgitation was reported by trials that compared the preoperative intake of a low volume of fluid (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>) or the intake of a high volume of fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>) to a standard fast. The one trial that compared the intake of unrestricted volumes of fluid intake preoperatively (n = 50) to a standard fast (n = 50) did not note any instances of aspiration or regurgitation (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-36" TYPE="TABLE">Table 36</LINK> Volume of Intake - Aspiration/Regurgitation.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>Twenty-four trials compared different volumes of preoperative intake with a standard fasting regimen by measuring the volume of participants' gastric contents. The data was pooled using a random effects model and presented in Comparison: 06 Volume of Intake - Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 01 Gastric Contents - Volume.</P>
<P>01 Low Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>Seventeen trials administered less than or equal to 150mls of fluid (low volume) to 550 participants while the remaining 433 participants followed a standard fasting regimen. Fluid intake varied from 100mls of water (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>) to 150mls of coffee (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>), orange juice (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>), clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>) an isotonic drink (<LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>) and water (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>). When required, pseudo-values were calculated for several trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>). On pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference in gastric content volumes between the participants that had a low volume of preoperative fluid intake (less than or equal to 150mls) and those that fasted (WMD -1.43ml, CI 95% [-3.56, 0.71]). A sub-group analysis of trials was conducted according to whether an H2-receptor antagonist was administered or not.</P>
<P>02 Low Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Participants were randomly allocated to receive a low volume of preoperative fluid intake (n = 314) or complete a standard fasting regimen (n = 258) in nine trials. An H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention was not evident. There was no indication that the two groups' mean volume of intra-operative gastric contents differed (WMD -3.77ml, CI 95% [-8.04, -0.50]).</P>
<P>03 Low Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Eight additional trials also randomised participants to the intake of a low volume of fluid (n = 236) or a standard fast (n = 175) but all participants also received a H2-receptor antagonist. On pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric volume (WMD -0.19ml, CI 95% [-1.98, 1.60]).</P>
<P>04 High Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) compared the intake of a high volume of fluids (300-450mls) preoperatively (n = 187) with a standard fast (n = 108). On pooling the data from these trials there was no evidence of a difference between the groups' mean gastric content volume (WMD -0.91ml, CI 95% [-8.46, 6.63]).</P>
<P>05 High Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Vincent 1991 evaluated the preoperative intake of a large volume of apple juice (360mls) (n = 19) in comparison to a standard fast (n = 34). The trial also included a ranitidine co-intervention. There was no indication of any difference between the groups' volume of gastric contents (WMD 3.00 mls CI 95%[-4.07, 10.07]).</P>
<P>06 Unlimited Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>Three trials permitted participants in the experimental group to have preoperative access to unlimited volumes of clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>) or water (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>). The fluid (n = 151) and fasted (n = 155) groups' volume of gastric contents were then compared. Pseudo-values were calculated for the <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK> trial. <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>reported mean, median and range values for the fluid (24.20, 21, 0-70 mls) and the fasted groups (25.70, 23, 0-115 mls) and pseudo-values are awaited for inclusion within the meta-analysis. On pooling the available data there was no indication of a significant difference in intra-operative gastric volume between those that were permitted the intake of unlimited fluids preoperatively and those that continued a standard fast (WMD 0.33ml, CI 95% [-4.38, 5.05]).</P>
<P>(iii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>Twenty-four trials compared different volumes of preoperative intake to a standard fasting regimen by measuring gastric acidity. Pseudo-values were calculated for some trials and a random effects model was used to pool the data in Comparison: 06 Volume of Intake - Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>01 Low Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Seventeen trials compared the intake of a low volume of fluid (n = 498) to a standard fast (n = 403) by comparing participants' intra-operative gastric pH values. Pseudo-values were calculated for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>) as appropriate summary statistics were not available for inclusion within the meta-analysis. On pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference in gastric pH values between the groups (WMD 0.05, CI 95% [-0.15, 0.25]). It was evident that the trials that had included an H2-receptor antagonist as a co-intervention had found much higher intra-operative gastric pH values across all participants and this aspect was investigated further through subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>02 Low Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Nine trials compared the intake of a low volume of fluid (n = 294) to a standard fast (n = 248) by comparing participants' intra-operative gastric pH values. <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK> reported median and range values for the fluid and fasting groups but pseudo-values were calculated and entered into the analysis. The data was pooled and there was no evidence of a difference in gastric pH values between the groups (WMD 0.10, CI 95% [-0.17, 0.36]). Only one trial found a significant between group difference (<LINK REF="STD-McGrady-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGrady 1988</LINK>) and it is of note that it was the only trial to report the use of methods of random sequence generation, concealment of allocation and blinding considered adequate to prevent bias.</P>
<P>03 Low Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (+H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Eight trials which included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention compared the gastric pH of participants that had a low volume fluid intake (n = 204) and a standard fasting regimen (n = 155). Pseudo-mean and pseudo-standard deviation values were calculated for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaan-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Samaan 1989c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yatsu-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Yatsu 1996b</LINK>). On pooling the results there was no evidence of a between group difference in pH values (WMD 0.02, CI 95% [-0.43, 0.47]).</P>
<P>04 High Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>Three trials compared the intra-operative gastric pH of participants (n = 110) permitted a high volume of preoperative fluid (300-450mls) and participants that followed a standard fast (n = 67). On pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric pH values (WMD 0.02, CI 95% [-0.46, 0.50]).</P>
<P>05 High Volume Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 1991</LINK>administered an H2-receptor antagonist to all participants and then compared the intake of a high volume of fluid (360mls of apple juice) to a standard fasting regimen by measuring participants' gastric pH. There was no indication the two groups' gastric pH differed (WMD -0.62, CI 95%[-2.21, 0.97]).</P>
<P>06 Unlimited Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>Three trials compared the gastric pH values from participants permitted unlimited volumes of fluid intake (n = 151) and those restricted to a standard fasting regimen (n = 155). Pseudo-values are presented within the meta-analysis for <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>. When the data was pooled there was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric pH (WMD 0.19, CI 95% [-0.01, 0.39]).</P>
<P>(iv) Gastric Contents - Marker Dye<BR/>Seven trials compared the intake of a low volume of preoperative fluids to a standard fast using a variety of non-absorbable marker dyes (cyanocobalamin, phenol red and bromosulphthalein).</P>
<P>Cyanocobalamin<BR/>01 Low Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>Two trials used cyanocobalamin to compare a high volume drink (400mls) of water (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>) or a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) (n = 92) to a standard fast (n = 50). Using a fixed effects model there was no evidence the volume of the groups' gastric contents differed (WMD -3.50ml, CI 95% [-14.24, 7.24]). Details are presented in Comparison: 06 Volume of Intake - Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 03 Gastric Contents - Cyanocobalamin.</P>
<P>Phenol red<BR/>One trial used phenol red as a marker dye (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1988</LINK>) and found little evidence of the marker dye in the intra-operative gastric content sample. Only six of the 57 participants' gastric contents contained more than 5% concentration of the marker dye. Additional summary data was unavailable.</P>
<P>Bromosulphthalein [BSP]<BR/>01 Low Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast<BR/>Four trials evaluated the preoperative intake of a low volume of fluid (100-150mls) (n = 120) to a standard fast (n = 120) by intra-operatively measuring the concentration of preoperatively ingested marker dye BSP. Researchers reported that only very low concentrations of marker dye were recovered from the groups with no significant difference between the groups observed on pooling the data using a fixed effects model (WMD -0.08 CI 95% [-0.27, 0.10]). Interestingly, the only trials that provided a high enough concentration of dye to allow analysis were those that included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention. Details are presented in Comparison: 06 Volume of Intake - Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast; Outcome 04 Gastric Contents - BSP.</P>
<P>02 Low Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (no H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987a</LINK> evaluated the intake of 100-150mls of fluids preoperatively using the marker dye BSP. No H2 receptor-antagonist a co-intervention was used. The amount of dye retrieved was so small the weighted mean difference was not estimable.</P>
<P>03 Low Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast (+ H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention)<BR/>An additional two trials compared the preoperative intake of 100-150mls of fluids (n = 60) to a standard fasting regimen (n = 60) by measuring the difference between the groups' gastric contents using the marker dye BSP. All participants were administered an H2-receptor antagonist. The amount of dye retrieved from participants was very small and on pooling of the results there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (WMD -0.08 CI 95% [-0.27, 0.10]).</P>
<P>(v) Secondary Outcome Measures<BR/>Twenty trials compared the preoperative intake of a low, high or unlimited volume of fluid preoperatively to a standard fasting regimen by measuring participants' thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and/or anxiety. Details of these trials, the outcomes measured and the measurement tools used can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-37" TYPE="TABLE">Table 37</LINK> Volume of Intake - Secondary Outcome Measures.</P>
<P>§ Thirst<BR/>Participants' thirst was measured by nineteen trials that compared a standard fasting regimen to one that permitted the preoperative intake of a low volume of fluid (less than or equal to 150mls), a high volume of fluid or unlimited clear fluids. Measurement tools included a VAS and a variety of four point scales. More of the participants that drank a small volume of fluid noted a reduction in their thirst over the preoperative period while the fasted participants in the same trials reported increased thirst over the same period (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>). Similarly, an additional three trials also noted a similar decrease in thirst ratings amongst participants' given a low volume drink though the fasted group either reported no change (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>) or a matching reduction in their thirst (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>) over the same period. The one trial that addressed postoperative thirst found no differences between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants who had a high volume drink preoperatively also reported reduced thirst preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) and postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>). In contrast, the participants that continued to fast reported an increase in thirst over the same preoperative period (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). Interestingly, <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK> found that both groups of participants (fasted and fluid) reported a decrease in thirst over the preoperative period and no difference between the groups postoperatively.</P>
<P>Three trials that randomly administered unlimited fluids to some participants while the others followed a standard fast. In <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK> the groups permitted unlimited clear fluid intake recorded significantly less preoperative thirst than the fasted groups. <LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>asked participants to rate thirst on four different measures ('normal thirstiness', 'usual dryness of mouth', 'current dryness of mouth' and 'satisfaction with fluid management') but found no evidence of a difference between the groups' thirst. ratings of thirst on these four measures. See <LINK REF="TBL-38" TYPE="TABLE">Table 38</LINK> Volume of Fluid Intake v Standard Fast - Thirst for details.</P>
<P>§ Hunger<BR/>Fifteen trials compared the preoperative intake of a low, high or unlimited volume of fluids to a standard fast by evaluating participants' perception of hunger. Participants were asked to rate their hunger on a VAS or a range of four point scales and all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) measured preoperative hunger. Details can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-39" TYPE="TABLE">Table 39</LINK> Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast - Hunger.</P>
<P>Where between group differences were indicated, those participants permitted a low (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maltby-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988c" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988d" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>), high (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>) or unlimited volume of preoperative fluid intake (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>) reported less hunger than the fasted groups. Unsurprisingly, during this fasting period levels of hunger were noted to rise amongst participants following a standard fast (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) and some participants permitted a preoperative drink (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>). Some researchers did find that preoperative hunger decreased amongst those groups permitted a low volume of fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 1988b</LINK>) or a high volume of a carbohydrate drink (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) though a similarly high volume of water did not demonstrate any difference in hunger ratings (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>). Only one trial suggested a between group difference in levels of hunger (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) and reported that at three different preoperative time points (d, e x 2) the group administered a carbohydrate drink reported less hunger than the group following a standard fast.</P>
<P>§ Pain<BR/>Five trials used a VAS to measure participants' pain. Comparisons were made between a standard fast and the preoperative intake of a low or high volume of fluids (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>). Levels of pain were measured pre- and postoperatively using a VAS. Few differences were found between groups' description of pain with only one trial reporting that the fasted group described less pain one hour postoperatively than the group permitted a low volume drink preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1991</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-40" TYPE="TABLE">Table 40</LINK> Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast - Pain for details.</P>
<P>§ Nausea<BR/>Participants' ratings of nausea were compared in eight trials that evaluated the intake of a low or an unlimited volume of preoperative fluid intake. Methods of measurement ranged from the use of a VAS, a yes/no question or noting the occurrence of nausea. See <LINK REF="TBL-41" TYPE="TABLE">Table 41</LINK> Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast - Nausea for details. There was little indication of a difference between groups' experience of pre- or postoperative nausea. Only <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK> found that the group given a high volume water placebo (400mls) experienced increased nausea over the preoperative period while others administering a similar volume of fluid found little change (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) or commented on the low incidence of nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>§ Vomiting<BR/>The incidence of vomiting was noted by seven trials using a yes/no question format, a VAS or through observation. Trials compared groups that followed a standard fast and those permitted a small, high or unlimited volume of preoperative fluid intake. No between group differences were observed. Details can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-42" TYPE="TABLE">Table 42</LINK> Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast - Vomiting.</P>
<P>§ Anxiety<BR/>The trials that compared a standard fasting regime to the intake of a low, high or unlimited volume of intake employed various methods of measuring 'anxiety'. Measurement tools included a three point rating scale of well being and VAS based measures of anxiety, dry mouth (referred to as a measure of anxiety) and nervousness. Measures were taken pre- and postoperatively. See <LINK REF="TBL-43" TYPE="TABLE">Table 43</LINK> Volume of Fluid v Standard Fast - Anxiety for details. Participants permitted a small drink of water (150mls) reported a reduction in anxiety over the preoperative period (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993a</LINK>) but there was no indication of a reduction in anxiety when the intake was a higher volume (greater than 150mls) (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK> in relation to dry mouth; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001a</LINK>). Other measures however did find that groups permitted a high or unlimited volume of fluids preoperatively were less anxious (<LINK REF="STD-Hausel-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Hausel 2001b</LINK>) less nervous (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1991</LINK>) or rated their well-being as better in comparison to previous anaesthetics (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>) than the group that remained on a standard fast. <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK> reported qualitatively on some participants' disquiet at the relatively large volume of fluid (450mls) they were required to drink because it was larger than what they would normally drink. This issue will be returned to in the discussion.</P>
<P>(b) Volume of Permitted Intake 1 v Volume 2<BR/>(i) Aspiration/Regurgitation<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993c</LINK> directly compared participants' preoperative intake of a low (150mls) (n = 25) and high volume (300-450mls) (n = 25) of water. There was no indication of aspiration or regurgitation amongst the participants. See <LINK REF="TBL-36" TYPE="TABLE">Table 36</LINK> Volume of Intake - Aspiration/Regurgitation for details.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993c</LINK> also compared the intake of 150mls (low volume) and 300-450mls (high volume) of water (n = 25 respectively) by examining the volume of participants' gastric contents. There was no difference between the groups (WMD 0.00mls, CI 95% [-11.09, 11.09]) and the results can be referred to in Comparison: 07 Volume of Intake - Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2]; Outcome 01 Gastric Contents - Volume.</P>
<P>(iii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>The intake of a low or high volume of water preoperatively was also compared by measuring participants gastric pH (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993c</LINK>). The 25 participants that drank 300-450mls of water preoperatively had slightly higher mean gastric pH (mean = 2.0) than the 25 participants that drank 150mls ( mean = 1.5) (p = 0.03, WMD 0.50 CI 95% [0.05, 0.95]). These results can be referred to in Comparison: 07 Volume of Intake - Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2]; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>(iv) Gastric Contents - Marker Dye<BR/>No trial compared the preoperative intake of a low and high volume of fluid using a marker dye.</P>
<P>(v) Secondary Outcomes (Thirst, Hunger, Pain, Nausea, Vomiting, Anxiety)<BR/>One trial directly compared the preoperative intake of a low (150mls) and high volume (300-450mls) of water by measuring participants' thirst, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993c</LINK>). Participants' ratings of hunger were not recorded. Using two VASs, a significant reduction in both the low and high volume groups' ratings of 'thirst' and 'dryness of mouth' were noted over time, see <LINK REF="TBL-44" TYPE="TABLE">Table 44</LINK> Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2] - Thirst. There was no indication that the groups' experience of postoperative pain (relating to degree of sore throat), nausea or vomiting differed and details are available in <LINK REF="TBL-45" TYPE="TABLE">Table 45</LINK> Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2] - Pain, <LINK REF="TBL-46" TYPE="TABLE">Table 46</LINK> Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2] - Nausea and <LINK REF="TBL-47" TYPE="TABLE">Table 47</LINK> Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2] - Vomiting. The group that drank 150mls of water reported reduced anxiety over the preoperative period on the VAS. No other differences were noted between or within the groups (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993c</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-48" TYPE="TABLE">Table 48</LINK> Volume 1 [V1] v Volume 2 [V2] - Anxiety. The group randomised to have the large volume drink (450mls) commented on the unusually large volume of fluid they were required to drink.

<P>4. SUBGROUPS OF 'AT-RISK' PATIENT POPULATIONS<BR/>Some patient populations may experience delayed gastric emptying and as a result be at an increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration/related morbidity during anaesthesia. An especially cautious approach to fasting prior to surgery is taken with these groups which include for example the elderly, those with systemic disease/disorders (e.g. diabetes), postpartum women and the obese. This review identified three trials that exclusively recruited participants from these 'at-risk' patient populations. One trial (recently completed) recruited obese surgical patients as participants (<LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK>) while an additional two trials were based on females one to four days (<LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>) or five days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>). The outcome measures presented below included (i) aspiration/regurgitation, (ii) gastric contents - volume, (iii) gastric contents - pH, (iv) gastric contents marker dye and (v) secondary outcome measures.</P>
<P>(i) Aspiration/Regurgitation<BR/>01 Postpartum<BR/>One trial recruited women one to four days postpartum and randomised them to either a preoperative drink of 150mls of water (n = 20) or to follow a standard fast (n = 20)(<LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>). There was no aspiration or regurgitation incident amongst either group. See <LINK REF="TBL-49" TYPE="TABLE">Table 49</LINK> At-Risk' Patient Populations - Aspiration/Regurgitation.</P>
<P>(ii) Gastric Contents - Volume<BR/>01 Obesity<BR/>Participants who were obese (BMI &gt; 30kg m<SUP>2</SUP>) were specifically recruited by <LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK> and randomly allocated to either a standard preoperative fasting regimen (n = 65) or a fasting regimen that included the intake of 300mls of clear fluid up to 180 minutes preoperatively (n = 65). The fasting group had a significantly lower mean gastric volume (29mls) than the group permitted fluid (48mls) (p = 0.001, WMD 19 mls, CI 95% [7.47, 30.53]). See comparison 08 'At-Risk' Patient Populations; 01 Outcome: Gastric Contents - Volume.</P>
<P>02 Postpartum<BR/>Two trials were based on women one to four days (Somwanshi 1995) and five days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>). Participants were randomised to either receive 150mls of water (n = 70) or to follow a standard fast (n = 70) group. Pseudo-mean and pseudo-standard deviation values were calculated for the <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK> trial and pooled with the results from <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK> trial using a random effects model. There was no evidence of a difference between groups' intra-operative gastric content volume (WMD 1.37ml, CI 95% [-2.71, 5.44]).</P>
<P>(iii) Gastric Contents - pH<BR/>01 Obesity<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Maltby_x002f_Pytka" TYPE="STUDY">Maltby/Pytka</LINK> found no evidence of a difference in the gastric pH of the obese participants' administered 300mls of clear fluid up to 180 minutes preoperatively (n = 65) and those who maintained a standard fast (n = 65) (WMD 0.02 CI 95%[-0.40, 0.44]). See Comparison 08 'At-Risk' Patient Populations; 02 Outcome: Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>02 Postpartum<BR/>Two trials evaluated the gastric pH of postpartum participants allocated to drink 150mls of water preoperatively (n = 70) or to a standard fasting regimen (n = 70) (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somwanshi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Somwanshi 1995</LINK>). Pseudo-values were calculated from the available data in the <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK> trial. Using a random effects model, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups' intra-operative gastric pH (WMD 0.10 CI 95%[-0.17, 0.37]). Comparison 08 'At-Risk Patient Populations; 02 Outcome: Gastric Contents - pH.</P>
<P>(iv) Gastric Contents - Marker Dye<BR/>No trial based on 'at-risk' participants evaluated a preoperative fasting regimen using marker dye as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>(v) Secondary Outcomes<BR/>One trial based on the postpartum anaesthetic population (<LINK REF="STD-Lam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1993</LINK>) evaluated preoperative fasting in relation to thirst and hunger, two of the secondary outcomes addressed within this review. See <LINK REF="TBL-49" TYPE="TABLE">Table 49</LINK> 'At-Risk' Patient Populations - Secondary Outcomes. Using a three point rating scale the postpartum participants permitted 150 mls of water 120-180 minutes preoperatively reported less thirst than the group that continued to fast (see <LINK REF="TBL-51" TYPE="TABLE">Table 51</LINK> 'At-Risk' Patient Populations - Thirst) but the two groups did not differ in their ratings of hunger (see <LINK REF="TBL-52" TYPE="TABLE">Table 52</LINK> 'At-Risk' Patient Populations - Hunger). No trial evaluated preoperative intake by measuring the 'at risk' anaesthetic populations' reports of pain, nausea, vomiting or anxiety.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise the reliable evidence from research in relation to preoperative fasting for the adult population. The outcomes addressed within the review (either directly or indirectly) were patient safety and comfort. The increasing complexity of the preoperative fast (in terms of an intervention) was addressed within the systematic review by examining the evidence in relation to the three main parameters of a preoperative fasting regimen i.e. the duration of fast and the type and volume of intake permitted during a period restricted intake. The evidence in relation to specific 'at-risk' patient groups was also considered. </P>
<P>As expected, the data in relation to the primary outcome measure aspiration and regurgitation and any associated morbidity was limited. Though some trialists did report on this outcome, most relied on surrogate indicators of risk i.e. participants' intra-operative gastric volume and pH. Many trials included within the review reported skewed distribution of these gastric content outcome values and whenever possible the values for mean and SD summary statistics were sought. A new approach was employed to allow inclusion of trials that reported summary data other than means and SD, within the meta-analyses. Pseudo-means and pseudo-standard deviations were calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>) and entered into the meta-analysis and pooled using a random effects model. The use of actual means and standard deviations would, of course, be preferential for inclusion within the meta-analysis and researchers should be encouraged to report (or make available) such data for meta-analysis purposes. </P>
<P>Following the review and presentation of the trial data in relation to the duration of a preoperative fast, there was no indication participants permitted fluids up to ninety minutes preoperatively were at increased risk (as measured by their gastric volume and pH) compared to participants that followed a standard fast. Most current clinical guidelines recommend that patients be permitted fluids up to two hours preoperatively e.g. (<LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CSBS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSBS 2002</LINK>). It is of note that Norwegian practices that have adjusted their local policies in response to their national recommendations have not reported any increase in the incidence of aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Fasting-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasting 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A six hour fast from solids is generally recommended by current clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CAS-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAS 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>) but some trials within this review evaluated the intake of a light breakfast less than six hours before surgery. Though there was no indication of a difference in the fed and fasted groups' gastric volume or pH, the trials were based on very small numbers of participants and the methodological quality was either unclear or considered inadequate. Such methodological limitations restrict any confidence in the clinical application of such an intervention. </P>
<P>This review also considered the type of intake permitted during a fasting period. Current preoperative fasting recommendations suggest that clear fluids be permitted during a shortened fluid fasting period. Within this review there was clear evidence that intake of water during the preoperative period actually resulted in significantly lower volumes of gastric contents on induction of anaesthesia than had no fluids been taken. This difference however was modest and is probably, clinically insignificant. Other fluids administered as part of a preoperative fasting intervention included coffee (in some cases with milk on request), orange juice, apple juice, Assam tea, a carbohydrate drink, an isotonic drink and clear fluids. The various non-water interventions also occasionally included an H2-receptor antagonist co-intervention, so evaluations of the type of fluid intake within the review were often the result of a single trial conducted on a small number of participants. Some significant between group differences were noted and indicate further avenues for targeting through more rigorous investigations. For example, there is some indication that participants who drank apple juice had a higher volume of more acidic gastric contents than participants who drank tea while those that drank apple or orange juice were noted to have more acidic gastric contents than those who fasted from fluid intake. In both comparisons an H2-receptor antagonist had been administered to all participants. The results of this review support the intake of clear fluids during a shortened fluid fast as outlined in current clinical guidelines, though additional investigations should be focused on the intake of other fluids during this preoperative fasting period. <BR/>
<BR/>The influence of H2-receptor antagonist co-interventions was clearly noted within the review across participants, trials, comparisons and outcomes. Participants within trials where H2-receptor antagonists were administered were noted to have low volumes of gastric fluids and high gastric pH. Recent clinical guidelines state clearly that the routine prophylactic administration of H2-receptor antagonists is not recommended for otherwise healthy patient groups considered to be at normal risk of aspiration and regurgitation (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The volume of fluid intake did not did not appear to have an impact on participants' gastric volume or pH when compared to a standard fast. Most trials asked participants to drink approximately one glass of water (150mls) though others prescribed an intake of 350-1000mls of fluid in the preoperative period. Some participants voiced disquiet at having to drink an unusually large amount of fluid (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f8_reide-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Søreide 1993b</LINK>) and in some cases broke protocol by not drinking the prescribed volume in full (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1995</LINK>). Given access to unlimited amounts of fluid it is likely that most people will exercise a natural restraint in the amount of their intake. Within the review those participants with access to unlimited preoperative fluids did not differ significantly in relation to their intra-operative gastric contents from those who fasted. Unfortunately the methodological quality of these trials was questionable but current national clinical guidelines have taken a pragmatic approach and omit mention of specific volumes in relation to preoperative fluid intake (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CSBS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSBS 2002</LINK>). The Norwegian guidelines do specify an amount for the final intake of water with premedication (one hour preoperatively) to be no more than 150mls (<LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials has been described in detail in the Methodological Quality section. Some aspects of the trial methodology (employed by most trials) minimised the possibility of bias such as the detailed listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria. About half the trials included in the review also used adequate methods of generating the randomisation sequence. However, as has been previously discussed (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_reide-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Søreide 1995b</LINK>) additional steps towards methodological quality could have been taken in many preoperative fasting trials. Concealment of the participants' allocation to the control and intervention groups was only occasionally demonstrated. </P>
<P>Trials included within the review were based on small sample sizes with no one arm of a trial containing more than 100 participants. In most cases participants were recruited from a very specific surgical population group i.e. healthy, non-pregnant, adult population undergoing elective surgery. The findings are therefore applicable only to those patient populations and do not extend to many anaesthetic patients considered to be at increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration (e.g. elderly, pregnant women (second trimester or later), emergency cases). Despite the fact that some of these patient groups are increasingly represented within the surgical settings, much of the preoperative fasting literature guidelines also demonstrate this bias toward the 'healthy' low-risk patient. Of the 'at-risk' patient populations addressed by this review, women one to five days postpartum, permitted water up to two hours preoperatively did not differ from postpartum women who fasted, in terms of gastric content values. Obese participants (BMI &gt; 30kg.m2) permitted 300mls of clear fluids two hours preoperatively however, were noted to have a higher mean gastric volume than the fasted group that was statistically and clinically significant. Additional focus should be paid to the other preoperative groups that have been recognised as having specific preoperative nutrition or hydration needs including those for example with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Haugen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haugen 1999</LINK>), cancer (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Jagoe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jagoe 2001</LINK>) or patients undergoing urgent and emergency surgery (<LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2002</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There was no evidence that participants given fluids two to three hours preoperatively were at an increased risk of aspiration/regurgitation (as measured by their gastric volume and pH) than participants who had followed a standard fast (nil by mouth from midnight). Unsurprisingly, a drink during the preoperative period was noted to be beneficial in terms of patients' experience of thirst. In addition, there was no indication that participants given fluids up to 90 minutes before induction of anaesthesia were at increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration but this was based on very small numbers of participants. </P>
<P>The preoperative fasting clinical guidelines that have preceded the publication of this review support a relaxation in preoperative fasting policies from the standard fast of 'nil by mouth from midnight' . Clear fluids up to two hours preoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>) and up to 150mls of clear fluid up to one hour before surgery with oral medication (<LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>) are recommended. Since the implementation of these guidelines there has been no report of a dramatic rise in the incidence of aspiration/regurgitation or associated morbidity or mortality (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Fasting-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasting 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is no evidence that drinking water during a preoperative period of restricted intake increases the risk of regurgitation/aspiration as evaluated by gastric pH and volume. The volume of gastric contents was actually significantly lower amongst participants that were administered water during the preoperative period, than those that followed a standard fast. This difference however cannot be considered of clinical significance (6mls). </P>
<P>These issues (and the recommendations made by the available guidelines) only apply to 'healthy' adult patients who are not considered to be at increased risk of aspiration/regurgitation during anaesthesia. Due to the limited number of trials based on 'at-risk' populations and in some cases the poor methodological quality of those trials, clear recommendations in relation to preoperative fasting for 'at-risk' groups cannot be made at this time. Additional sources of evidence including best practice statements should be sought when considering the preoperative fasting preparations for such patients. </P>
<P>Multidisciplinary teams responsible for the care of surgical patients should be aware of the evidence in relation to preoperative fasting, the relevant national clinical guidelines and local fasting policies. Whenever possible such policies should be presented in a simple and easy-to-follow format. Such information however, should not be restricted to the multidisciplinary preoperative team. In some settings increasing pressure on hospital beds has resulted in more surgical patients being admitted to non-surgical wards (<LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2002</LINK>). In recognition of this, any staff with a responsibility for ensuring a patient's preoperative fast should be made aware of the local fasting policies and recommendations. </P>
<P>Patients' compliance with the preoperative fast has always been crucial, but will become increasingly important with the growth and promotion of day surgery for elective surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Commission" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Commission</LINK>). Staff will need to ensure that patients are educated on the benefits of the new fasting policy (when applicable), through the provision of adequate information, to explain any deviation from an expected 'nil by mouth from midnight' policy (<LINK REF="REF-McKinley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinley 1995</LINK>). </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large scale randomised controlled trials designed to evaluate the effect of two fasting regimens by measuring the primary outcome incidence of aspiration/regurgitation are unfeasible. While adverse events are thankfully few, it is important that trials evaluating preoperative fasting regimens consistently report the presence or absence of such events. Adverse incidents are of primary importance to patient care and this should be reflected within trial reports. Well-designed methodologically sound randomised controlled trials are still needed to further examine several issues including<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the type of fluid intake permitted during a restricted fasting period. </LI>
<LI>the preoperative intake of solids as some practices appear to have become more lenient with the preoperative intake of solids than the evidence reviewed here would support (<LINK REF="REF-Fasting-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasting 1998</LINK>). </LI>
<LI>the preoperative fasting needs of previously excluded groups i.e. patients considered to be at increased risk of aspiration/regurgitation (e.g. the elderly, those with diabetes).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>In general the trials included within this review demonstrated a high methodological quality taking adequate steps to ensure the methods of random sequence generation were protected from bias and the assessors of gastric volume or pH had been blinded to whether participants were fasted or not. These procedures should continue to be included within the design of any future research while taking the additional steps to ensuring the adequate concealment of participants' allocation to the groups. In addition, trials should be based upon a priori sample size calculations and authors should be encouraged to report mean and standard deviation data (or make them available on request) to allow accurate representation of summary data within a meta-analysis when required. Though classified within this review as secondary outcomes, measures of thirst and hunger are of great importance to patient comfort. The development of the methodology involved in the accurate, unbiased measurement of these outcomes that would allow comparisons overtime, participants and trials should be supported.</P>
