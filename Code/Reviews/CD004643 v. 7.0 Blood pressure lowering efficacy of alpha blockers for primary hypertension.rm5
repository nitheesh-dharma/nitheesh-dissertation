<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 10:59:24 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The class of drugs called alpha blockers is sometimes used to lower elevated blood pressure. This class includes drugs such as doxazosin (brand name: Cardura), prazosin (Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). We asked how much this class of drugs lowers blood pressure and whether there is a difference between individual drugs within the class. The available scientific literature was searched to find all the trials that had assessed this question. We found only 10 trials studying the blood pressure lowering ability of 4 different alpha blockers in 1175 participants. The blood pressure lowering effect was modest. There was an 8-point reduction in the upper number that signifies the systolic pressure and a 5-point reduction in the lower number that signifies the diastolic pressure. No alpha blocker drug appears to be any better or worse than others in terms of blood pressure lowering ability. Due to incomplete reporting of the number of participants who dropped out of the trials due to adverse drug reactions, as well as the short duration of these trials, this review could not provide an estimate of the harms associated with this class of drugs.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 23:12:20 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the BP lowering effect of alpha blockers is modest; the estimate of the magnitude of trough BP lowering of -8/-5 mmHg is likely an overestimate. There are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between different alpha blockers. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with alpha blockers because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-11 15:54:12 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension is an important health problem and it is associated with an increased risk of death, stroke, and heart disease. Considerable scientific evidence shows that blood pressure reduction with different drug treatments reduces death, stroke, and heart disease. However, evidence also suggests the blood pressure lowering effects of different classes of antihypertensive agents may not always parallel the reductions in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>). In other words, blood pressure lowering does not always predict the same magnitude of improvement in health outcomes. Other factors may contribute to the reductions in mortality and vascular morbidity with antihypertensive drugs. Such factors may be independent of the blood pressure lowering effect of the drug, or the mechanism by which these drugs lower blood pressure. Nevertheless, blood pressure reduction remains an important factor.</P>
<P>Alpha blockers are used as pharmacological agents for the treatment of hypertension. In light of the findings of the ALLHAT hypertension trial (<LINK REF="REF-ALLHAT-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ALLHAT 2000</LINK>), where the alpha blocker (doxazosin) treatment arm of the trial was stopped early due to a statistically significant increase in congestive heart failure, angina and stroke compared to the thiazide-like diuretic, chlorthalidone, alpha blockers are rarely used as first-line antihypertensive therapy. Nevertheless, alpha blockers are still widely used as second- or third-line agents and perhaps as first-line agents in hypertensive patients with concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia.</P>
<P>One of the main difficulties of managing a patient with hypertension using alpha blockers is deciding which dose should be prescribed. This decision should be made primarily on the basis of the best available evidence of effectiveness. Despite nearly 30 years of research evidence and clinical use of alpha blockers, the dose-related blood pressure lowering effect of this antihypertensive drug class is still not known.</P>
<P>A systematic review of the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of alpha blockers has not been previously performed. The aims of this systematic review are: 1) to quantify the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of alpha blockers in patients with primary hypertension; and 2) to establish dose equivalencies of different drugs within the alpha blocker class. The information derived from this review should facilitate future reviews of head-to-head comparisons with other drug classes and assist clinicians in choosing optimal doses of alpha blockers.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The databases listed above were searched and potentially relevant citations were identified. The initial screen of these abstracts excluded articles whose titles and/or abstracts were clearly irrelevant. The full text of remaining articles was then retrieved (and translated into English where required) to assess whether the trials met the prespecified inclusion criteria. The bibliographies of pertinent articles, reviews and texts were searched for additional citations. Two independent reviewers (BSH and BPG) assessed the eligibility of the trials using a standardized trial inclusion form. A third reviewer (JMW) resolved discrepancies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer (BSH or BPG) using standardized data extraction forms and checked by a second reviewer (BPG or BSH). If data were presented numerically (in tables or text) and graphically (in figures), the numeric data were preferred because of possible measurement error when estimating from graphs. All numeric calculations and extractions from graphs or figures were confirmed by a second reviewer. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>The position of the patient during blood pressure measurement may affect the blood pressure lowering effect. However, in order not to lose valuable data, if only one position was reported, data from that position were extracted. When blood pressure measurement data were available in more than one position, data were extracted in accordance with the following order of preference: 1) sitting; 2) standing; and 3) supine.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers (BSH and BPG) independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s recommended tool, which is a domain-based critical evaluation of the following domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2008</LINK>). Assessments of risk of bias are provided in the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table for each study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>If there were multiple reports from the same study, the duplicate publications were scanned for additional data. If necessary, investigators were contacted (by email, letter and/or fax) to obtain the missing information.</P>
<P>In the case of missing values for standard deviation of the change in blood pressure or heart rate, the standard deviation was imputed based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same dose. The following hierarchy (listed from high to low preference) was used to impute standard deviation values:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pooled standard deviation calculated either from the t-statistic corresponding to an exact p-value reported or from the 95% confidence interval of the mean difference between treatment group and placebo.</LI>
<LI>Standard deviation of change in blood pressure/heart rate from a different position than that of the blood pressure data/heart rate used.</LI>
<LI>Standard deviation of blood pressure/heart rate at the end of treatment.</LI>
<LI>Standard deviation of blood pressure/heart rate at the end of treatment measured from a different position than that of the blood pressure/heart rate data used.</LI>
<LI>Standard deviation of blood pressure/heart rate at baseline (except if this measure was used for entry criteria).</LI>
<LI>Weighted mean standard deviation of change in blood pressure/heart rate from other trials using the same class of drug (at any dose).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If there was significant statistical heterogeneity (P-value &lt;0.10} associated with an effect estimate, a random effects model was applied. This model provides a more conservative statistical comparison of the difference between intervention and control because a confidence interval around the effect estimate is wider than a confidence interval around a fixed effect estimate. If a statistically significant difference was still present using the random effects model, the fixed effect pooled estimate and 95% CI was reported because of the tendency of smaller trials, which are more susceptible to publication bias, to be overweighted with a random effects analysis.</P>

<P>Data were processed in accordance with the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2008</LINK> for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data synthesis and analyses were done using Review Manager 5.0 software.</P>
<P>Blood pressure and heart rate (continuous outcomes) were expressed as the mean (±SD) change from baseline to follow-up. Otherwise continuous outcomes were pooled as weighted mean difference (WMD). Withdrawals due to adverse effects (dichotomous outcome) for each comparison were expressed as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If there was a statistically significant relative risk difference, the associated number needed to treat/harm was also calculated.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Direct and indirect comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, direct and indirect comparisons of effect sizes between doses were performed for each alpha blocker. In the direct method, only trials that randomized participants to different doses were included in the analysis. In the indirect method, an "adjusted indirect comparison" and the associated standard error were calculated using the method described by <LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2003</LINK>.

<P>Four of the included trials reported the standard deviation of the change in blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dauer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauer 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mersey-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mersey 1984</LINK>). These values were pooled for the alpha blocker and placebo groups and weighted mean estimates of the standard deviation of the change in SBP and DBP were determined. The weighted mean standard deviations of the change in SBP and DBP were 12.4 (SD 3.7) mm Hg and 7.1 (SD 1.0) mm Hg for the alpha blocker group, respectively. For the placebo group, the standard deviation of the change was 13.6 (SD 3.0) mm Hg for SBP and 7.4 (SD 0.9) mm Hg for DBP. There was no statistically significant difference between the alpha blocker and placebo groups for SD of SBP change or SD of DBP change. These values were used according to the imputation hierarchy for trials that did not report SD of BP change or reported an outlier SD value.<I>
<BR/>
<BR/>
</I>The SD of BP change was imputed for 5 of the included studies. Of these studies, 1 was imputed using endpoint SD, 1 was imputed using baseline SD for SBP, 2 were imputed using the weighted mean SD of SBP change from other trials, and 4 were imputed using the weighted mean SD of DBP change from other trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequence generation, allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>All the trial publications simply reported that the trial was "randomized" but did not provide any details about the randomization method. Details of the method of allocation concealment were reported in only 1 of the 10 included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schnaper-1975_x002c_-Study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Schnaper 1975, Study 2</LINK>). Such vague reporting is insufficient to be confident that the allocation sequence was properly randomized and adequately concealed given the fact that many investigators use the term "randomized" when it is not justified. Authors should report their methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment clearly.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding bias</HEADING>
<P>Nearly all the trial publications simply reported that the trial was "double-blind" but did not provide any details about the blinding methods. Only 2 trials described the blinding method as using "identical" placebo capsules. The potential for loss of blinding was reduced because 9 of the 10 trials included a dose titration period up to the randomized dose to minimize the characteristic hypotensive effects associated with alpha blockers. The success of blinding in patients or investigators was not assessed in any of the included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>It is unlikely that attrition bias would have had an impact on the systematic review since most of the patients randomized to fixed-dose monotherapy in each trial completed the double blind treatment period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>This would not affect the blood pressure measurements as these were the primary outcome of most of these trials. There is a potential for selective reporting bias for heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects since only half of the included trials reported these outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection Bias</HEADING>
<P>Another potential source of bias that we became aware of in working on this review is patient selection bias. One of the exclusion criteria reported in 3 trials was participants with a known hypersensitivity or a history of failure to respond to alpha blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillenwater-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gillenwater 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Os-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Os 1999</LINK>). This suggests that investigators have knowledge of each participant's prior experience with this drug class and thus may select for patients who have responded favorably to alpha blockers in terms of BP lowering or have been found to tolerate treatment with alpha blockers. However, it was not possible to prove selection bias as none of the included trials described in detail these details of patient recruitment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication Bias</HEADING>
<P>Although trials must have been completed and provided to the regulators in order for the drug to be approved for the treatment of primary hypertension, only 10 trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria for our review. Furthermore, many of the doses that have been approved by regulators do not have sufficient published trial evidence to support their use. In fact, for some doses there were no published data available. For example, doxazosin has been approved up to a maximum daily dose of 16 mg. However, we only found data for the effect of doxazosin up to 12 mg and we know that trials must have been completed and provided to the regulators for doxazosin at 16 mg daily.</P>
<P>Another source of bias that is likely to have a significant impact on this review is the selective publication of trials with positive results. This review was evaluated for the existence of publication bias since it only included and appraised published trial evidence. In the absence of bias, the funnel plot should resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel since the precision in the estimation of the true blood pressure lowering decreases as the study size decreases. Thus small studies will scatter more widely at the bottom of the graph (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2008</LINK>). The most common way to investigate whether or not a review is subject to publication bias is to examine for funnel plot asymmetry as smaller studies with null results remained unpublished. However, due to the small number of included trials, funnel plots could not be generated to adequately assess whether publication bias is likely. Despite this limitation, there was still evidence of selective publication of positive trials. One publication (<LINK REF="STD-Harder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harder 1994</LINK>) only reported on a subset of patients (from a single center) randomized in a multicenter study. The full data for this multicenter study has not been published elsewhere. A report of another study provided "only a preliminary analysis of the blood pressure data obtained", with only the DBP data reported for one of the three groups receiving terazosin (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1991</LINK>). A published report of the complete BP data for all treatment groups was not identified by our comprehensive search.</P>
<P>A total of 11 connected papers published between 1984 and 1990 summarized a series of trials conducted by the manufacturer that assessed the clinical profile of terazosin in hypertensive patients. Only after close scrutiny of these 11 papers were we able to determine that they were duplicate publications of the same trials. Three of these trials (Study M81-059, M81-060 and M81-061) were fixed dose studies that met our inclusion criteria, of which 2 have been published elsewhere in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Mersey-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mersey 1984</LINK>) or as a report on only a subset of the total randomized patients (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1985</LINK>). A review article by <LINK REF="REF-Dauer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauer 1986</LINK> summarized the BP data for all patients randomized in these 3 studies and, therefore, was used as the primary reference. The potential for mistaking these connected papers as separate trials as opposed to duplicate publications is high and thus could have led us to incorrectly believe there were more trials assessing terazosin if we had not conducted such a thorough examination.<BR/>
<BR/>The results of this review underscore the need for all studies, regardless of the findings, to be published and accessible for secondary analysis. Trial registration has been recognized in order to improve transparency in research and knowledge sharing. In recent years, regulatory bodies around the world, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), have set standards for trial registration and reporting and are urging research institutions and companies to register all medical studies that test treatments on humans. Initiatives such as the WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform will help improve transparency and reduce the risk of publication bias skewing the results of future systematic reviews.</P>
<P>Because of the high likelihood of publication bias outlined above we think that the estimates of blood pressure lowering effect that we have calculated is likely an overestimate of the real effect.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging BP lowering efficacy of individual alpha blocker drugs</HEADING>
<P>Summarized below are the dose-related trough blood pressure lowering efficacy estimates of 4 alpha blockers that were administered once daily in the included studies. The weighted mean placebo effect across all trials was -1.7 (95% CI -7.0, 3.5; range -5.5 to 5.5) mm Hg and -3.9 (95% CI -7.3, -0.5; range -5.6 to 3.5) mm Hg for SBP and DBP, respectively. Therefore, to determine the magnitude of the BP lowering efficacy of each alpha blocker, a weighted mean difference from placebo (alpha blocker effect size minus placebo effect size) with a 95% confidence interval (in parentheses) was calculated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging BP lowering efficacy of bunazosin</HEADING>
<P>Only one small trial (n=16) assessed bunazosin at doses of 3, 6 and 12 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Harder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harder 1994</LINK>). The risk of publication bias is high because this study was performed in one center as part of a multicenter trial that has not been published. Furthermore, the baseline BP differed between the bunazosin 12 mg and placebo groups by 31.3 mm Hg for SBP and 7.5 mm Hg for DBP, which brings into question the quality of randomization in this trial. For these reasons, we did not attempt to estimate the BP lowering efficacy of bunazosin based on this published report and have not included this trial in the Data and analysis section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging BP lowering efficacy of doxazosin</HEADING>
<P>Three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gillenwater-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gillenwater 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Os-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Os 1999</LINK>) assessed the BP lowering efficacy of doxazosin from 2 to 12 mg/day but there were no data available at 16 mg/day, the manufacturer's maximum recommended daily dosage. Doxazosin at 2 mg/day did not significantly reduce BP compared with placebo. Doxazosin at 4 mg/day was the lowest effective dose, demonstrating a significantly greater reduction in SBP and DBP as compared to placebo. Compared with placebo, the 8 mg/day group also had a statistically significant reduction in SBP and DBP. The reduction in the 12 mg/day group did not reach statistical significance compared with placebo but this is likely due to a paucity of data. Since there were few studies at each dose, there were insufficient data to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between any of the doses using indirect comparisons and thus very limited information regarding the dose-response of doxazosin.<BR/>
<BR/>Based on the available data, the best estimate of the blood pressure lowering efficacy for doxazosin 4 to 12 mg/day is -6.42 (95% CI -10.12, -2.80) mm Hg for SBP and -3.53 (95% CI -4.99, -2.07) mm Hg for DBP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging BP lowering efficacy of prazosin</HEADING>
<P>One of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Singleton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Singleton 1989</LINK>), sponsored by the manufacturer, evaluated the BP lowering efficacy of a controlled-release formulation of prazosin (prazosin GITS) 2.5, 10 and 20 mg/day and one additional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schnaper-1975_x002c_-Study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Schnaper 1975, Study 2</LINK>) reported the change in BP with standard prazosin 3 mg/day. Prazosin at 2.5 and 3 mg/day did not statistically significantly lower BP compared with placebo. The lowest effective dose is 10 mg/day. Due to the wide confidence intervals, an indirect comparison of 20 mg/day with 10 mg/day did not show a statistically significant difference. Because of the lack of data, there is very limited information regarding the dose-response of prazosin.<BR/>
<BR/>Based on the limited available data, the best estimate of the blood pressure lowering efficacy for prazosin GITS 10 to 20 mg/day is -10.38 (95% CI -16.21, -4.56) mm Hg and -6.90 (95% CI -9.79, -4.01) mm Hg for SBP and DBP, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging BP lowering efficacy of terazosin</HEADING>
<P>Four of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dauer-1986_x002c_-Study-M81_x002d_059" TYPE="STUDY">Dauer 1986, Study M81-059</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mersey-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mersey 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1991</LINK>) evaluated terazosin from 5 to 20 mg/day but, with exception to the two trials that contributed to the DBP effect estimate of terazosin at 5 mg/day, there was only one study at each dose and therefore insufficient data to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between any of the doses using indirect comparisons. Based on the available evidence, terazosin at 5 mg/day was the lowest dose that demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in SBP and DBP as compared to placebo. It is possible the lowest effective dose may be lower than 5 mg/day but there are no available data. Efficacy data for 10 and 20 mg/day did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in BP compared with placebo. However, this is likely due to the wide confidence intervals associated with the effect size estimate. Due to a lack of data for each dose, a dose-response relationship with terazosin could not be statistically established.</P>
<P>When all doses were combined to establish an overall effect with terazosin, there was a statistically significant reduction in SBP and DBP compared with placebo. The best estimate of the BP lowering effect of terazosin at 5 to 20 mg/day is -6.59 (95% CI -10.22, -2.96) mm Hg for SBP and -4.40 (95% CI -5.95, -2.84) mm Hg for DBP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of the blood pressure lowering efficacy of alpha blockers</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> provides an overview of the lowest effective dose, the lowest dose with near maximal blood pressure lowering and the near maximal blood pressure lowering effect of each alpha blocker studied in this review. The lowest effective dose is defined as the lowest dose for which there is a statistically significant difference from placebo. The lowest dose with near maximal blood pressure lowering efficacy is defined as the dose that demonstrates a statistically significantly greater response than doses below it, but does not exhibit a statistically significant difference in effect size compared with higher doses.</P>
<P>Due to a lack of data, neither an estimate of the lowest dose with near maximal blood pressure lowering efficacy nor an estimate of the near maximal blood pressure lowering efficacy could be determined for any of the individual alpha blocker drugs. Instead, the best estimate of the trough blood pressure lowering efficacy of each alpha blocker is based on the limited data that were available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blood pressure variability</HEADING>
<P>The variability of blood pressure at both baseline and endpoint was not reported in any of the included trials. Therefore, the effect of alpha blockers on blood pressure variability could not be assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging peak blood pressure lowering efficacy</HEADING>
<P>One of the included trials reported the peak blood pressure lowering efficacy of doxazosin 2-8 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1988</LINK>). Only doxazosin at 8 mg/day demonstrated a statistically significant difference compared with placebo, -12.90 (95% CI -20.34, -5.46) mm Hg for SBP and -8.50 (95% CI -13.32, -3.68) mm Hg for DBP. This effect was larger than the trough effect but the limited data does not allow one to make any conclusion as to whether there is a difference in peak and trough effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging effect on pulse pressure</HEADING>
<P>Pulse pressure was not reported as an outcome in any of the included trials and there were insufficient data to adequately determine the effect of each alpha blocker on pulse pressure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging effect on heart rate</HEADING>
<P>Only three of the included trials provided dose-related heart rate data (<LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harder 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Singleton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Singleton 1989</LINK>). All trials reported changes in heart rate at trough and one trial reported changes in heart rate at peak (<LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1988</LINK>). The available data suggests no effect on heart rate; however, there were insufficient data to evaluate the dose-related effect of the individual alpha blockers on heart rate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose-ranging effect on withdrawals due to adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>An analysis of withdrawals due to adverse effects during 3 to 12 weeks of treatment with alpha blockers was only reported in 4 of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cubeddu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cubeddu 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gillenwater-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gillenwater 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harder 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Singleton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Singleton 1989</LINK>). There were insufficient data to evaluate the dose-related effect of the individual alpha blockers on withdrawals due to adverse effects. These 4 trials were combined to assess the effects of alpha blockers as a class on WDAE and there was no statistically significant difference versus placebo.<BR/>

</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-11 10:50:43 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only 10 trials with a mean duration of 5.9 weeks at a fixed dose of alpha blocker met the pre-specified inclusion criteria and reported data on 1175 participants (811 treated with alpha blockers and 364 treated placebo) with a weighted mean age of 57 years, weighted mean baseline blood pressure of 155/101 mm Hg and a mean pulse pressure of 54 mm Hg.</P>
<P>Due to the limited number of published studies, there is insufficient evidence for the various alpha blockers to generate dose-response curves for systolic and diastolic BP reduction as well as accomplish the secondary goals of this review. At any given dose of alpha blocker, there were only 1 or 2 studies contributing BP data, with the only exception being 3 studies that measured the trough DBP lowering efficacy of doxazosin at 4 mg once daily.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is the magnitude of the effect of alpha blockers on BP?</HEADING>
<P>When the different alpha blockers are compared, there is a remarkable similarity in the trough BP lowering effects of doxazosin and terazosin (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Although numerically higher, the trough BP lowering effect of prazosin is not significantly different than either doxazosin or terazosin using indirect comparisons. When the best estimate of the BP lowering efficacy of these 3 drugs is combined, the overall estimate is -8/-5 mmHg. Because of the high likelihood of publication bias as discussed above this is most likely an overestimate of the real effect. If that is the case, then alpha blockers probably have a lesser ability to lower blood pressure than drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system, which also have been estimated to lower trough BP by 8/5 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Musini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2008</LINK>). If it is not an overestimate then the BP lowering effect could be similar. Complete reporting of all the alpha blocker trials that have been completed are needed.</P>
<P>Given the limited data available, it is impossible with this analysis to be certain that there are any BP lowering differences between one or more of the drugs. It would require head-to-head trials of different alpha blockers at equivalent BP lowering doses to assess whether or not there are differences between different drugs. This review will provide useful information for estimating equivalent doses and thereby designing trials to compare different alpha blockers. However, at the present time given that all the drugs are working by the same mechanism and the similarities in the blood pressure lowering effect it is most likely that the near maximal BP lowering of the different alpha blockers is the same.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">For each alpha blocker, do the manufacturer's dosage recommendations coincide with the findings of this review?</HEADING>
<P>There is insufficient evidence of the dose-related BP lowering efficacy for each alpha blocker and thus no comparison could be made with the manufacturer's recommendations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is the effect of alpha blockers on BP variability?</HEADING>
<P>The variability of blood pressure at both baseline and endpoint was not reported in any of the included trials so the effect of alpha blockers on blood pressure variability could not be assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Is there evidence of a dose-response relationship for heart rate?</HEADING>
<P>There is a possibility of selective reporting bias of resting heart rate only 3 trials reported data for this outcome. Based on the 3 trials for which data were available, alpha blockers do not appear to affect heart rate. However, there were insufficient data to determine a dose-related effect on heart rate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Is there evidence of a dose-response relationship for withdrawals due to adverse effects?</HEADING>
<P>There were not enough data to construct a meaningful dose-response relationship for individual alpha blockers to determine a dose-related effect on WDAE. The available data demonstrate that for all doses alpha blockers did not change WDAE compared with placebo. However, only 4 included trials reported the number of WDAE, so selective reporting bias is a distinct possibility. A description of the type and severity of the adverse effects that led to premature withdrawal was rarely reported. Short-term trials are not the best type of trial to assess adverse effects and longer trials and other types of data can assist, such as non-randomized trials or post-marketing surveillance studies. However, there is no justification for not reporting all withdrawals due to adverse effects in all completed trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>Given that alpha blockers are commonly prescribed as second- or third-line antihypertensive agents or even as first-line agents in hypertensive males with benign prostatic hyperplasia, the lack of published RCT evidence of the dose-ranging BP lowering efficacy for this class of drugs is alarming. It is clear that not all the trials assessing the efficacy of alpha blockers have been published. We know that because many of the doses that have been approved by regulators are not included in this review. For example, there were no trials assessing maximum recommended dose of doxazosin, 16 mg daily. Also, the usual recommended dose range of terazosin is 1 mg to 5 mg administered once a day; however, there are no available data for 1 mg per day. Furthermore, efficacy data are available for 3 mg of standard prazosin only, yet it is recommended from an initial dose of 1 mg two or three times a day up to a total daily dose of 20 mg. We know that trials must have been completed and provided to the regulators for the other doses.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Specific findings of the review</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>The review provides very limited data on the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of 4 different alpha blockers at trough. A dose-response relationship for the blood pressure lowering effect of the alpha blockers could not be established. The best estimate of the trough blood pressure lowering efficacy of these drugs is -8/-5 mm Hg; however, this is likely an overestimate of the real effect. The data do not suggest that any one alpha blocker is better or worse at lowering blood pressure.</LI>
<LI>The effect of alpha blockers on blood pressure variability, pulse pressure, or heart rate could not be determined.</LI>
<LI>All doses of alpha blockers, whether analyzed individually or combined, did not change WDAE as compared to placebo; however, this outcome was not reported for 6 of the 10 trials so this lack of demonstrated effect is unlikely to be real.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications of these findings</HEADING>
<P>The major limitation of this review is that it is limited to available trials and it is evident that a lot of trials that manufacturers would have needed to gain marketing approval have not been published and otherwise available. Thus, even though there was no evidence of publication bias using standard methods to assess this, there remains a high risk for publication bias. It is also estimated that there is a risk of patient selection bias that could have led to overestimation of the blood pressure lowering effect. For these reasons, the magnitude of blood pressure lowering found is this review is probably an overestimate of the true effect. This observation makes even more surprising that the estimates of trough and peak blood pressure lowering effects of the alpha blockers are modest at best and lower than commonly believed can be achieved by this class of drugs. Furthermore, the dose-related blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs could not be established and thus it is unclear whether higher doses have a greater effect than demonstrated here.<BR/>
<BR/>This review did not provide any evidence of an increase in withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, this finding is severely limited by the short duration of the included trials and a high risk of both selective reporting bias and patient selection bias. Therefore, this systematic review is not a good measure of the incidence of adverse effects of this class of drugs.</P>
<P>Therefore, due to limited published RCT evidence, this review is only able to provide physicians with limited information necessary to optimize prescribing of alpha blockers in patients with elevated blood pressure.</P>
