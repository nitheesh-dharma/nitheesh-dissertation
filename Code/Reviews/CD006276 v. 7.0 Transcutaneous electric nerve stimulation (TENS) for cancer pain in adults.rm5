<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-17 02:05:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer-related pain is complex and multidimensional but is mostly managed using drug therapy. There is increasing recognition of the need for non-drug approaches and TENS may have a significant role to play. Only one new study met eligibility criteria for this review update, making at total of three included studies. TENS was given to 15 participants in one study, 41 participants in the other and 24 participants in the most recently included study. The newly included study suggested TENS might improve cancer bone pain on movement, but as a pilot study it was not designed to determine the impact of TENS on pain. The two studies in the previous review did not show that TENS significantly improved cancer pain. One study did not have sufficient participants to determine whether or not TENS had an effect. TENS was well tolerated in all three studies. There were significant differences in participants, treatments, procedures and symptom measurement tools used in the studies. In two of the studies some participants were able to identify when they received active TENS and when they received placebo. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to judge whether TENS should be used in adults with cancer-related pain. Further research using well designed clinical trials is needed to improve knowledge in this field.<BR/>

There is a need for non-pharmacological and innovative approaches.

<P>The initial review searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED and PEDRO databases in April 2008. We performed an updated search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDRO databases in November 2011.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-10 19:57:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTS) investigating the use of TENS for the management of cancer-related pain in adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-11 18:20:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy identified a further two studies for possible inclusion. One of the review authors screened each abstract using a study eligibility tool. Where eligibility could not be determined, a second author assessed the full paper. One author used a standardised data extraction sheet to collect information on the studies and independently assess the quality of the studies using the validated five-point Oxford Quality Scale. The small sample sizes and differences in patient study populations of the three included studies (two from the original review and a third included in this update) prevented meta-analysis. For the original review the search strategy identified 37 possible published studies; we divided these between two pairs of review authors who decided on study selection; all four review authors discussed and agreed final scores.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 18:20:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one additional RCT met the eligibility criteria (24 participants) for this updated review. Although this was a feasibility study, not designed to investigate intervention effect, it suggested that TENS may improve bone pain on movement in a cancer population. The initial review identified two RCTs (64 participants) therefore this review now includes a total of three RCTs (88 participants). These studies were heterogenous with respect to study population, sample size, study design, methodological quality, mode of TENS, treatment duration, method of administration and outcome measures used. In one RCT, there were no significant differences between TENS and placebo in women with chronic pain secondary to breast cancer treatment. In the other RCT, there were no significant differences between acupuncture-type TENS and sham in palliative care patients; this study was underpowered.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 18:20:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the one additional RCT, the results of this updated systematic review remain inconclusive due to a lack of suitable RCTs. Large multi-centre RCTs are required to assess the value of TENS in the management of cancer-related pain in adults.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-11 18:32:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many reasons why a patient with cancer may experience pain; these include pain associated with the disease, pain associated with the cancer treatments and any associated co-morbid conditions. The mainstay of cancer pain management has predominantly used the biomedical approach including drug therapy, medical or surgical treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Turk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turk 1998</LINK>). However, it is clear that cancer-related pain is complex and multidimensional and there is a definite need for a multi-disciplinary team approach, utilising non-pharmacological and innovative approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Raphael-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raphael 2010</LINK>). Physical treatments such as electrical stimulation may have a role for a significant number of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raphael-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raphael 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-09 14:41:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive therapeutic intervention which has been widely used for many years to manage a range of acute and chronic pain problems (<LINK REF="REF-DeSantana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSantana 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1997</LINK>). TENS is used in a variety of clinical settings and has gained popularity with both patients and healthcare professionals of different disciplines. TENS devices have many advantages in that they are portable, easy to use, have relatively few adverse effects or contra-indications and allow the user autonomy over their pain control.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-11 21:27:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several types of TENS application which are used in clinical practice, but the two most common are high frequency, low intensity (conventional) TENS (HF-TENS) and low frequency, high intensity (acupuncture-like) TENS (AL-TENS) (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2009</LINK>). Intense low frequency high intensity TENS can be administered for a few minutes at a time to deliver maximum tolerable (painful) TENS paraesthesiae (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2009</LINK>). More recent developments of TENS have evolved with the aim of improving the efficacy of TENS and these include 'burst' and 'modulated' modes of stimulation. The analgesic action of TENS is mediated by peripheral and central nervious system mechanisms, both spinal and supra spinal (<LINK REF="REF-DeSantana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSantana 2008</LINK>). The clinical use of conventional TENS is underpinned by the gate control theory of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1965</LINK>), which suggests that there is a 'gating' mechanism in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord which can control nociceptive signals and ultimately influence the pain experience. In summary, the stimulation of large diameter (A-beta) afferent fibres is thought to 'close the gate' and reduce the perception of pain. Acupuncture-like TENS stimulates A-delta and C fibres and is therefore thought to achieve pain control mostly through the descending pain suppression system. In essence, acupuncture-like TENS is thought to help close the gateway of pain transmission and hence result in a reduction in pain. However, the physiological mechanisms underpinning the action of different TENS modalities may not be this distinct. In mice, high and low frequency TENS activate large diameter afferents, peripheral alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors appear to contribute to high and low frequency TENS analgesia and blockade of GABA A receptors at a spinal level inhibits the analgesic effect of both modalities (<LINK REF="REF-DeSantana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSantana 2008</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-09 15:23:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of Cochrane systematic reviews published which address the use of TENS for non-cancer related pain (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khadilkar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khadilkar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroeling-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroeling 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulvey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulvey 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nnoaham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nnoaham 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutjes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutjes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2006</LINK>). In addition, several review articles (<LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reeve-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeve 1996</LINK>) address TENS in benign pain. There is some controversy over the use of TENS in chronic pain, with most review papers citing the need for further research using large multi-centre RCTs. The single available review in cancer pain addresses non-drug approaches for symptoms related to cancer and includes the evidence on TENS for pain management (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2000</LINK>). Although experts in the field suggest that TENS has an important role in the management of cancer-related pain (<LINK REF="REF-Filshie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filshie 2000</LINK>), and a recent case series suggested a potential role in cancer bone pain (<LINK REF="REF-Searle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Searle 2008</LINK>), it is clear that there is currently no guidance for clinicians on the use of TENS for oncology and palliative care patients. The clinical benefit of TENS for cancer patients with pain remains controversial.</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane review is to determine the effectiveness of TENS in the management of cancer-related pain and to provide guidance for healthcare professionals and patients on the optimal parameters of TENS for best pain relief.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 21:32:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included only studies that evaluated TENS administered using a standard TENS device that delivered monophasic or biphasic pulsed electrical currents in the mA range. We did not include studies that used percutaneous electrical stimulation. We considered conventional TENS as administered using any TENS device which delivered a "strong but comfortable" electrical sensation either:<BR/>
<BR/>i. in an area of pain where sensation is present; or<BR/>ii. over nerve bundles proximal to the site of pain.</P>
<P>Our definition of appropriate TENS delivery also included the use of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation devices (NMES) and Interferential current devices, providing that a "strong but comfortable" electrical sensation was produced. We considered any parameters of treatment which resulted in this, as was any duration and frequency of treatment. TENS is typically delivered using at least two surface electrodes; however, we also included studies involving single electrical probes (i.e. TENS pens), providing that a "strong but comfortable" electrical sensation was produced. This included the placement of electrodes over an area of pain that co-incidentally included acupuncture points. Given the above physiological criteria, we excluded studies where TENS was delivered at intensities reported to be "barely perceptible" or "mild".</P>

<P>We identified two additional studies by the updated search, only one of which met the eligibility criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK>). The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Sima-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sima 2009</LINK>) investigated the efficacy of electroacupuncture at recognised acupoints. As a percutaneous intervention it was excluded from our review which was concerned exclusively with transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Only two of the 43 potential studies identified by the original search met the eligibility criteria for review (<LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK>). The most common reasons for exclusion were non-randomised studies and the published source contained no clinical data (i.e. educational reviews). We have provided a full list of the excluded studies and the reasons for exclusion in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>

<P>The two RCTs included in the original review were heterogenous with respect to study population, sample size, study design, methodological quality, mode of TENS, treatment duration, method of administration and outcome measures used (<LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK>). Participants who had previously used TENS were excluded in both studies. <LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK>, who is also a member of this review team, compared conventional TENS with Transcutaneous Spinal Electroanalgesia (TSE) and sham TSE in 49 cancer survivors with chronic pain associated with breast cancer treatment. The investigators attempted to mimic clinical practice and used treatment for three weeks duration of each intervention with participants also self-treating at home as needed. They assessed outcome using measures for pain, anxiety, depression and physical functioning. <LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK> investigated acupuncture-like TENS for cancer pain or nausea and vomiting, or both, in 15 terminally ill participants. The investigators administered TENS for 30 minutes daily for five days and assessed the outcome using a quality of life questionnaire and a performance status score (<I>see</I> '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table for more details).</P>
<P>The additional RCT identified by the updated search performed in June 2011 (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK>) was a multicentre study assessing the feasibility of a phase III trial of TENS in patients with cancer bone pain receiving palliative care. Unlike other included studies, previous TENS use was not an exclusion criterion. Employing a crossover design, conventional TENS was compared with placebo TENS in 24 patients with heterogenous cancer diagnoses, stable analgesic medication and radiological evidence of bone involvement. A single continuous treatment with active or placebo TENS was applied by a medical researcher for 60 minutes at the bone pain site. Between two and seven days later active or placebo TENS, depending of the previous application, was administered for 60 minutes. Pain intensity and pain relief, at rest and on movement, were measured using Numerical (NRS) and Verbal Rating Scales (VRS); 19 participants completed the cross-over and provided evaluable data. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and patient satisfaction questionnaires were also completed.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-01-13 17:32:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst not designed or adequately powered to investigate treatment effect, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK> indicated that cancer bone pain on movement may improve with TENS. On verbal pain relief scores 12 participants (63.2%) experienced good or very good pain relief with active TENS at one hour, compared with five participants (26.3%) on placebo. The difference in the proportion of participants experiencing good or very good pain relief on movement with active compared to placebo TENS was statistically significant: 36.8% (95% CI 7.55 to 66.2%). NRS scores for pain relief and pain intensity on movement did not reach statistical significance. For pain relief on movement, participants had a mean score at one hour of 52.6 for active TENS compared with 38.4 with placebo (difference = 14.2, 95% CI -3.34 to 31.76), where higher scores indicated better pain relief. The mean NRS scores for pain intensity on movement at one hour were 2.84 with active TENS and 3.05 with placebo TENS (difference = -0.32, CI -1.85 to 1.22), where higher scores indicated more intense pain. The study did not indicate that cancer bone pain at rest improved with TENS. Only five of the 22 adverse events were deemed at least possibly related to TENS. Only two withdrawals were related to pain during TENS application. Only one of these was during active TENS application.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK> found no significant differences in pain relief scores between TENS or sham TSE. There were also no significant differences in any of the other outcome measures, except one dimension of a patient satisfaction questionnaire where TENS was considered significantly more effective than sham TSE. Twenty-six of 41 women (63%) who completed the study decided to continue with a device on completion of the trial and of these, the majority (n = 13) decided to continue with TENS, as opposed to sham TSE (n = six). The majority of the women continuing with TENS were still using it to good effect at three months (n = 14) and 12 months (n = 10), with those using sham TSE to good effect at three months and 12 months (n = 4 and n = 2 respectively). Overall, TENS appeared to be well tolerated; women found TENS easy to use and few reported difficulties with electrode placement. Adverse effects were monitored and reported and were minimal in this study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK> did not detect any statistically significant differences between AL-TENS and sham AL-TENS. However, the study was underpowered, with only five participants randomised into each of the three treatment groups and only 13 participants completing the study.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-13 17:35:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this systematic review examining the effectiveness of TENS for cancer pain in adults remain inconclusive due to a lack of suitable RCTs. Only one RCT, in addition to the two RCTs identified by the initial review, met the inclusion criteria for review, and heterogeneity of these RCTs prevented meta-analysis. The studies were different with respect to study population, sample size, study design, methodological quality, mode of TENS, treatment duration, method of administration and outcome measures used. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK>) scored four out of five for the Oxford Quality Score. The former provided little evidence that TENS was superior to a placebo in treating women with chronic pain following breast cancer treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK> was not designed to investigate treatment effect and addressed only bone pain. Although pain relief VRS on movement showed greater improvement with active than placebo TENS, no firm conclusion can be drawn from this. The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK> did not suggest TENS relieved cancer bone pain at rest. <LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK> scored three out of five and provided no evidence that TENS was significantly better than placebo in treating pain in palliative care patients. We are unable to comment on important clinical issues such as optimal treatment parameters, as there were insufficient data for analysis.</P>
<P>There have been no previous systematic reviews on TENS in cancer pain and only one review paper has been published (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2000</LINK>). This paper reviewed the use of complementary and alternative medicine to manage pain and other symptoms associated with end of life. Four studies on TENS were discussed (<LINK REF="STD-Avellanosa-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Avellanosa 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ostrowski-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ostrowski 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wen 1977</LINK>), one of which was included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2000</LINK> concluded that TENS, along with a range of other interventions, may provide pain relief in palliative patients with pain but acknowledged that there is a paucity of data to support this. A major criticism of the majority of studies found in the literature search is that they were mostly case-series or non-randomised studies and the bulk of these studies were published in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-14 21:23:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In summary, there is insufficient evidence to judge whether TENS should be used in adults with cancer-related pain. Further research is needed to improve knowledge in this field. <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK> identified pain relief on movement as the most appropriate outcome for future research and calculated the sample size required for further research.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-01-13 17:35:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All three RCTs found in the literature search were undersized and lacked sufficient power to detect significant differences. <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK> was designed as a feasibility study rather than a powered clinical trial. <LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK> performed power calculations but failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK> did not perform any power calculations. Although <LINK REF="STD-Gadsby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gadsby 1997</LINK> maintained double blind conditions, adequate blinding was not maintained in <LINK REF="STD-Robb-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robb 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2010</LINK>. As pain is a highly subjective symptom, the inadequacy of blinding introduces considerable risk of bias.</P>

<P>Quote: "The high electrical skin resistance of these patients appeared, on questioning the patient for the level of comfort by the trialist, to be blocking the sensory stimulation of the ALTENS from reaching conscious awareness. This blocking of sensory awareness and the communication of such between patient and trialist also helped to reduce the risk of operator bias."

This was undertaken by a second independent observer who kept a record of the codes throughout the trial."</P>
