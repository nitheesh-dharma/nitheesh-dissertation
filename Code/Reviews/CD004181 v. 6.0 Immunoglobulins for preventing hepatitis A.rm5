<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-16 14:15:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis A is a common, contagious viral disease in low-income countries. Hepatitis A is transmitted primarily by faecal-oral spread from person to person. Passive immunoprophylaxis for hepatitis A using immunoglobulin preparations were essential for prevention before development of specific hepatitis A vaccine (active immunisation). This review concludes that immunoglobulins seem effective for preventing hepatitis A in both children and adults. However, the evidence, on which the conclusion is based, is not strong as the included trials appear to have risk of bias and their number is insufficient.<B>
<I> </I>
</B>Because there is a potential risk of blood-borne diseases from immunoglobulins preparations, such as human immunodeficiency virus, and because of the availability of hepatitis A vaccine, the use of immunoglobulins has become limited. However, their use is still required in some specific populations, such as persons with compromised immune function, children under one year of age, or persons who have not developed a full response to vaccine immunisation. Future clinical trials should address the benefit and harm of immunoglobulins in these populations.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-16 23:25:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 trials with 567,476 participants randomised to pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis. The trials had high risk of bias. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of study setting, participants, interventions, and outcome measures. Our meta-analysis with six randomised trials showed that immunoglobulins, when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis, significantly reduced the number of adult patients with hepatitis A at 6 to 12 months (1020/286503 versus 761/134529; RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70; random-effects model) in comparison with no intervention or inactive control. Four trials showed a similar effect in children aged 3 to 17 at 6 to 12 months follow-up (917/210822 versus 677/78960; RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.59). Comparing different doses of immunoglobulins, higher dosage was generally more effective than lower dosage (1.5 ml better than 0.75 ml and 0.75 ml better than 0.1 ml) in preventing hepatitis A. No significant systemic adverse events were reported. One trial showed that immunoglobulin was more effective than placebo for post-exposure prophylaxis. It appeared that there was no significant difference between immunoglobulins and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine in seroconversion to hepatitis A vaccine antibodies at four weeks (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.38), but immunoglobulins were significantly less effective than vaccine regarding antibody levels at 8, 12, or 24 weeks. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-30 13:37:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis A is one of the oldest diseases known to the mankind, caused by infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV). It was formerly called infectious hepatitis, epidemic hepatitis, epidemic jaundice, or catarrhal jaundice (<LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollinger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollinger 1996</LINK>). Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease. The severity of the disease increases with age at time of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lemon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemon 1997</LINK>). HAV results in fulminant hepatitis and death in a small proportion of patients. HAV is a significant cause of morbidity and social-economic losses in many parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Tormans-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tormans 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollinger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berge 2000</LINK>). Worldwide, 1.4 million persons are getting clinically-evident infection per year (<LINK REF="REF-VHPB-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">VHPB 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transmission of HAV occurs typically through the faecal-oral route (<LINK REF="REF-Lemon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemon 1997</LINK>). Poor sanitation and crowded living conditions usually produce the infection early in life, which confers lifelong immunity. With improved sanitation and hygiene, infections are avoided in childhood. Consequently, the number of adults susceptible to the disease increases. Under these conditions explosive epidemics can arise from faecal contamination of a single source, as did the largest mollusc-linked epidemic reported in Shanghai in 1988, infecting about 300,000 people (<LINK REF="REF-Melnick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnick 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevention of hepatitis A can be achieved through passive immunisation, using immunoglobulins from pooled human plasma (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>). Since 1992, active immunisation using inactivated or live attenuated hepatitis A vaccines has been possible (<LINK REF="REF-Werzberger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werzberger 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>For pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A, immunoglobulins have been considered to be effective since the 1940s (<LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>). Immunoglobulins are administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.02 ml/kg before possible exposure. Such a dose may provide protection for one to two months. The dose of 0.06 ml/kg may protect for three to five months. For prolonged exposure over five months, repeated injections of immunoglobulins at five- to six-months intervals are recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>). However, immunoglobulins for pre-exposure prophylaxis has now been replaced by hepatitis A vaccine that in most cases offer protection for up to 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Nothdurft-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nothdurft 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>For post-exposure prophylaxis, active immunisation may not raise antibody titres fast enough to offer protection. The administration of immunoglobulins can reduce the incidence of hepatitis A up to 90% if used within two weeks of exposure; it will either prevent development or reduce the severity of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lemon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koff 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>). Such post-exposure prophylaxis can be given to household, sexual, and institutional contacts of patients with acute hepatitis A as soon as possible after the exposure. Immunoglobulins have been given routinely to persons exposed to HAV in common source outbreaks such as food-borne outbreaks (<LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>). In some settings, a combination of passive immunisation with immunoglobulins plus active immunisation with hepatitis A vaccine may be appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many high-income countries, immunoglobulins for preventing hepatitis A have been abandoned because of the potential risk of using pooled human plasma, eg, the risk of transmitting retrovirus HIV, hepatitis C, or Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease (CJD) (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 2002</LINK>). However, immunoglobulins are still widely used for preventing hepatitis A in many low-income countries.</P>
<P>Though web sites like those of Centers of Disease Control come with recommendations for immunoglobulin usage in preventing hepatitis A, we could not identify systematic reviews on which such recommendations were based. We, therefore, found it necessary to conduct a systematic review on the beneficial and harmful effects of pre- and post-exposure administration of immunoglobulins for preventing hepatitis A. After our protocol for the present systematic review was published (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>), we identified one non-Cochrane systematic review with meta-analysis of six trials studying the beneficial and harmful effects of immunoglobulins for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A (<LINK REF="REF-Bianco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianco 2004</LINK>). This review concluded that immunoglobulins are efficacious in preventing infectious hepatitis and hepatitis A, with an average length of three months protection.</P>

<P>The primary outcome measures sought at maximal follow-up were:<BR/>1. Occurrence of hepatitis A. The diagnosis was made by serological detection of immunoglobulins M class antibodies to HAV, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and clinical symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, headache, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, jaundice, etc (<LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>).<BR/>2. Occurrence of subclinical HAV infection. The diagnosis was made by serological detection of immunoglobulins M class antibodies to HAV without any non-specific or hepatitis-specific symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were:<BR/>3. Anti-HAV antibody level, assessed by validated methods, such as enzyme immunoassay or radial immunoassay.<BR/>4. Number and type of adverse events. Two types of adverse events were analysed, serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events. Any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, resulted in persistent or significant disability, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was an event that might have jeopardised the patient or required intervention to prevent one of the former adverse events was considered a serious adverse event (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>). All other adverse events were considered non-serious.<BR/>5. Cost effectiveness.</P>

<P>Seven of the 13 included trials used a cluster randomised design, and the randomisation unit was either a school class or a pre-school kindergarten (<LINK REF="STD-Ignatieva-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Ignatieva 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iurkuvenas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Iurkuvenas 1982</LINK>), or military unit (<LINK REF="STD-Kark-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Kark 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kark-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kark 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1993</LINK>). Four trials described the methods on how the allocation sequence was generated or how allocation concealment was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conrad-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Conrad 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iurkuvenas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Iurkuvenas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Victor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 2007</LINK>), which was evaluated as adequate. The remaining trials did not provide information on the generation of allocation sequence and the allocation concealment. Three trials used double blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conrad-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Conrad 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Victor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 2007</LINK>), and one trial used blinding of participants only (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1993</LINK>). Only one trial performed blinded outcome assessment. Three trials allocated individuals randomly (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shouval-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Shouval 1993a</LINK>), but did not provide information about the generation of the random allocation, allocation concealment, or blinding.</P>
<P>As cluster randomised trials are quite different from randomised trials on individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>), we also used the recently published CONSORT statement extension to cluster randomised trials to assess the methodological quality of the trials, ie, bias risk. It includes four major quality components: rationale for adopting a cluster design; how the effects of clustering were incorporated into the sample size calculations; how the effects of clustering were incorporated into the analysis; and the flow diagram of both clusters and individuals through the trial, from assignment to analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>). The six cluster randomised trials did not specify the rationale for the cluster design. Only one trial accounted for the estimation of the sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1993</LINK>). The effects of clustering were not incorporated into the data analyses or result interpretation. There was no flow diagram to demonstrate the implementation of clustering.</P>
<P>One trial reported that 14 participants out of 76 participants were lost to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1993</LINK>). Another trial specified the numbers and reasons of withdrawal and loss to follow-up, and intention-to-treat analyses were used (<LINK REF="STD-Victor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 2007</LINK>). Other trials reported that no participants were lost to follow-up during the trial and all participants were included in data analyses.</P>
<P>In general, one third of the 13 trials was assessed as low risk of bias, and the remaining as inadequate and to be associated with risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

The trials followed the participants for 3 to 18 months. Immunoglobulin showed significant effect on protection of participants against hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis) for different follow-up durations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Immunoglobulin showed significant effect of reduction of hepatitis A occurrence (39/22159 versus 34/8722; RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.71) at three months of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1981b</LINK>). A meta-analysis of three trials showed significant effect of immunoglobulin on reduction of clinical occurrence of hepatitis A at six months follow-up (132/81142 versus 201/65127; RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.80). For 6 to 12 months follow-up, meta-analysis of six trials showed significant effect of reduction of icteric hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis (1020/286503 versus 761/134529; RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70) (random-effects model <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

<P>One trial used both HAV vaccine and immunoglobulins compared with HAV vaccine alone or immunoglobulin alone in 76 male adults (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1993</LINK>). No clinical occurrence of hepatitis was observed in any of the groups. All participants developed detectable anti-HAV antibodies (more or equal to 20 mIU/ml) four weeks after initial immunisation in both groups. However, the geometric mean antibody titres among those who had received the vaccine were 1.8 to 2.9 times higher than in those who had received immunoglobulins with the vaccine (P &lt; 0.001).

There was no significant difference between immunoglobulins and the vaccine (29/30 versus 25/30; RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.38) at four weeks. However, immunoglobulins were significantly less effective than the vaccine in maintaining hepatitis A antibody seropositivity at eight weeks (20/30 versus 27/30; RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98), 12 weeks (3/30 versus 29/30; RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30), and 24 weeks (0/30 versus 30/30; RR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>

However, there was no significant difference either between 2 ml and 1 ml (42/7905 versus 40/8675; RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77), or 1 ml and 0.1 ml (12/5258 versus 13/5579; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.14) in another study in children (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1981b</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>

<I>Use of immunoglobulins in high or low prevalence regions</I>

The number of hepatitis A patients was significantly reduced by immunoglobulins at 11 months follow-up for both high and low prevalence regions (262/29847 versus 172/9786; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.60, and 152/57472 versus 76/18283; 0.64; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.84, respectively). This trial may indicate more beneficial effect of immunoglobulins in the low prevalence regions (proportion without protection 0.26%, 152/57472) than in the high prevalence regions (0.88%, 262/29847) (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1981a</LINK>). A later trial by the same research group showed that there was no significant difference in the protective effect between high and low prevalence by using immunoglobulins with 1:10 000 titres of anti-HAV antibodies (9/1914 versus 3/2278) (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1984</LINK>). The proportion with hepatitis A was 0.47% (9/1914) in high prevalence region and 0.13% (3/2278) in low prevalence region. However, when using immunoglobulins with 1:2500 titres of anti-HAV antibodies, the lack of protective effect in low prevalence regions seems to be lower than in the high prevalence regions (24/1908 versus 13/2266), and the proportion with hepatitis A was 0.57% (13/2266) in the low prevalence region and 1.26% (24/1908) in the high prevalence region (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1984</LINK>).</P>

The globulin B (produced in 1961) showed significant effect of reducing infectious hepatitis (2/238 versus 16/250; RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.56), but globulin A (produced in 1954) did not show the beneficial effect (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). A recent trial showed no significant difference between immunoglobulin and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine in either clinical or subclinical hepatitis A or clinical plus subclinical hepatitis A for 4 to 8 weeks follow-up in both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Victor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>No adverse reactions were reported. A total of 28 serious adverse events occurred, including 25 with hepatitis A, one for appendicitis, one for rubella, and one for moderately severe bronchitis (<LINK REF="STD-Victor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 2007</LINK>), but all these events were determined to be unrelated to the study interventions.</P>

<B>
<I>Efficacy of immunoglobulins for prophylaxis of hepatitis A</I>
</B>
<BR/>All immunoglobulins used in the included trials were commercial products. It seems that there is no standard regimen for the administration of immunoglobulins. Compared with no intervention (unimmunised populations) or placebo, immunoglobulins showed beneficial effect in pre-exposure prophylaxis against hepatitis A in both children and soldiers. It appears that no extra short-term benefit can be obtained from the use of immunoglobulins plus HAV vaccine comparing with the vaccine alone. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution as the majority of early trials are evaluated as low quality based on their reporting of study design and methods.</P>
<P>The findings from four trials that evaluated different dosages of immunoglobulins showed a tendency that higher doses of immunoglobulins were superior to lower doses of immunoglobulins for hepatitis A protection. However, there were some inconsistent findings. Due to insufficient information about the titres of the antibodies in the immunoglobulin preparations, we think these comparisons provide very limited information. Our explanation for this inconsistency may include the differences in titres of the antibody in products, in age and sex, sensitivity to hepatitis A, as well as prevalence of hepatitis A. Immunoglobulin with higher titre of antibody appears to be more effective in prevention of hepatitis A than that with lower titre of antibody (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the development of hepatitis A vaccine in the early 1990s, there has been interest in the comparative benefits of immunoglobulins and vaccine. For pre-exposure prophylaxis, one trial shows no significant difference between immunoglobulins and HAV vaccine in seroconversion to anti-HAV antibodies at one month (<LINK REF="STD-Shouval-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Shouval 1993a</LINK>). However, when the antibody levels were assessed at three months and six months, the HAV vaccine was significantly better than immunoglobulins. This suggests that immunoglobulins may only be of short-term benefit, while HAV vaccine is effective for longer periods. Considering the limitation of this single, small trial, and lack of solid clinical data, current evidence suggests that HAV vaccine may be the first choice for pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A and immunoglobulin may be a reasonable alternative to the vaccine when hepatitis A vaccine is not available.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Duration of immunoglobulins protection</I>
</B>
<BR/>The exact duration of immunoglobulin protection cannot be sufficiently established from this review due to variations among participants, in dose or titres, and in duration of follow-up. The protective efficacy has been achieved at six months' time in adults and 11 months' time in children after immunisation with immunoglobulins. An early study reported that among Peace Corps volunteers who were given immunoglobulins (0.05 ml/lb), 76 out of 93 icteric hepatitis patients were observed less than two weeks or over 16 weeks after immunoglobulins administration (<LINK REF="REF-Woodson-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodson 1969</LINK>). However, there was no serological confirmation of the diagnosis. Other non-randomised studies showed that administration of an intermediate dose of immunoglobulins offered effective protection for five to six months (<LINK REF="STD-Weiland-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Weiland 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conrad-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conrad 1987</LINK>). Therefore, four to six months protection is likely to be the effective duration for pre-exposure prophylaxis in adults. Two Russian trials compared use of immunoglobulins in high prevalence regions regarding hepatitis A with low prevalence regions; the protective effect seemed to be in favour of immunoglobulin usage in low prevalence regions. Thus, it was suggested that immunoglobulins were of greater benefit to population in low-prevalence regions (<LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorbunov-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbunov 1984</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Post-exposure prophylaxis</HEADING>
<P>Current guideline of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases recommends immune globulin for post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A, especially contacts to hepatitis A patients in the home, child care centres, and other selected sites (<LINK REF="REF-AAPCID-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPCID 1996</LINK>). In this review, an early placebo-controlled trial suggests that globulin is effective in post-exposure prophylaxis of acute infectious hepatitis (<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1968</LINK>). A recent trial with low risk of bias showed the equal protective effect of immunoglobulin and hepatitis A vaccine (over 95% protection rate), suggesting hepatitis A vaccine as an alternative to immune globulin for post-exposure prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Victor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Strengths of this review</I>
</B>
<BR/>We managed to identify 13 randomised clinical trials on the topic, which is more than twice the number that Bianco and coworkers identified in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Bianco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianco 2004</LINK>). We also conducted this review, based on a published, peer reviewed protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Limitations of this review</I>
</B>
<BR/>Even that our searches were comprehensive, we could identify only a small number of randomised trials. The trials varied in design, country settings, populations, treatment regimens, and follow-up periods. Cluster randomised trials may differ in the nature of randomisation unit, matched pair, and sizes of the clusters randomised. It may be inappropriate to combine randomised trials in individuals with trials in clusters (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). This is why our findings need to be interpreted with caution and heterogeneity of the trials need to be noted. In addition, the majority of the included trials were published 10 to 20 years ago; they were assessed as having high risk of bias in terms of methodological components for assessing the bias risk of the randomisation procedure, blinding, and reporting of cluster randomised trial designs. All this reduces the strength of our findings. This review cannot conclude on the relative benefit in comparing immunoglobulins passive immunoprophylaxis with active HAV vaccination as only one small trial evaluated this (<LINK REF="STD-Shouval-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Shouval 1993a</LINK>). However, a recently published double-blinding trial shows equal effect of immunoglobulin and hepatitis A vaccine in post-exposure prophylaxis and they are safe for use. We still need additional evidence of the beneficial effect of immunoglobulins, administered for post-exposure prophylaxis against hepatitis A vaccine, in special populations such as elderly, HIV-infected, and immunocompromised. Adverse events from immunoglobulins administration were not reported, except for minor local injection discomfort. We should remain cautious about the potential risk of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Future research</I>
</B>
<BR/>Because hepatitis A vaccine is not recommended for use in children less than one year of age or certain immunocompromised persons (<LINK REF="REF-Halsey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halsey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>), immunoglobulins are still have value for pre-exposure prophylaxis for these groups travelling to high-risk countries. The Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP) of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends immunoglobulins for persons travelling to high-risk areas less than four weeks after the first dose of hepatitis A vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It may also be worth to compare the benefits and harms of using passive immunoprophylaxis for terminating an outbreak with active vaccination of persons at risk.</P>

<I>Pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A</I>
</B>
<BR/>The use of immunoglobulins is decreasing since the development of hepatitis A vaccine. The vaccine can markedly decrease the risk of contracting hepatitis A. This review shows that immunoglobulins may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A in both children and adults. However, the interpretation of this finding needs to be taken with caution because the included trials were of low methodological quality. Considering potential risk of blood-borne diseases including HIV, immunoglobulins may be administered only at limited situations, such as in children less than one year old, who would travel to endemic areas of hepatitis A; certain immunocompromised persons; or as a supplement to HAV vaccine before the complete protective immunity is fully established.</P>

<BR/>The protective effect against hepatitis A for post-exposure population is established, but hepatitis A vaccine may be an alternative to immunoglobulin in some circumstances.</P>

<P>The optimal immunisation regimen of immunoglobulins may be studied as an alternative to the vaccine for pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A in some circumstances. Consideration should be given to special setting, such as day-care centres, nurseries, primary schools, and to special populations, such as children less than one year, the elderly, the HIV-infected, or other immunocompromised populations. While running trials, blood-borne related adverse events should be monitored and reported in the publications. The report of randomised clinical trials as well as cluster randomised trials should follow the CONSORT statement (www.consort-statement.org).</P>

<P>As we identified some trials within which subgroup analyses were done for the dosage of immunoglobulin and testing the interventions in regions with different prevalence of hepatitis A (high versus low prevalence), we have added the subgroup analyses in this review according to the comparisons, different duration of follow-up, age (children and adults), different coverage of the immunoglobulin injection, or sex (when available). We were not able to perform the pre-specified sensitivity analysis and funnel plot analysis to explore potential publication bias due to limited number of trials with the same intervention and control as well as outcome measures.</P>
<P>In the protocol, we said we will handsearch some conference proceedings, but later, we found that there is a database in our University Library and we changed the handsearch with electronic search of the database.</P>
