<P>ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 20 January 2014 using the terms: "bright light*", "light box*", "light visor*", "dawn-dusk*", phototherapy, "photo therapy", "light therapy" "light treatment", light* . The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major healthcare databases (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-22 06:21:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All relevant, randomized controlled trials were included in which light therapy, at any intensity and duration, was compared with a control group for the effect of improving cognition, ADLs, sleep, challenging behaviour, and psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia (as well as institutionalization rates or cost of care). Included were people with dementia of any type and degree of severity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-23 02:16:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance, and four review authors independently assessed the selected studies for risk of bias and extracted the data. Statistically significant differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups at the end of treatment and follow-up were examined. Each study was summarized using a measure of effect (for example mean difference).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-23 02:22:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven trials (13 articles) met the inclusion criteria. However, three of the studies could not be included in the analyses either because the reported data could not be used in the meta-analysis or we were unable to retrieve the required data from the authors.</P>
<P>This updated review found no effect of light therapy on cognitive function, sleep, challenging behaviour (for example agitation), or psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia. Reduction in the development of ADL limitations was reported in one study, at three of five time points, and light therapy was found to have an effect after six weeks and two years but not after one year.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-24 16:44:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-24 16:44:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia is a term for a syndrome that includes symptoms such as loss of memory, judgment and reasoning ability; psychiatric disturbances; and a variety of behavioural changes. Brain function is affected enough to interfere with a person's ability to function at work, in relationships, or in everyday activities (Alzheimer Society of Canada) (<LINK REF="REF-ASC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASC 2013</LINK>). The World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>) declared dementia a public health priority, citing the high global prevalence and economic impact on families, communities, and health service providers. As of 2010, more than 35.6 million people worldwide were living with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-World-Alzheimer-Report-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Alzheimer Report 2012</LINK>). This number is expected to double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-World-Alzheimer-Report-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Alzheimer Report 2012</LINK>). Total healthcare costs for people with dementia amount to more than 1% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), or USD 604 billion in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-World-Alzheimer-Report-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Alzheimer Report 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Normal aging is associated with physiological changes to circadian rhythms. Compared to younger adults, people aged 65 years and over may experience changes in core body temperature, melatonin rhythm, and the circadian rest&#8211;activity cycle which may present as fragmented nocturnal sleep, multiple and prolonged awakenings in the second half of the night, and increased daytime napping (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>). These abnormalities are more frequent and pronounced in older adults with dementia, and specifically those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (<LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>) when they may be associated with other related disturbances such as rest-activity cycle disruptions and sundowning (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>). The neurobiological basis of these behavioural disorders is related to degenerative changes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus that result in reduced expression of the vasopressin (AVP) gene (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK> reported that the total amount of AVP-mRNA expressed in the SCN was one-third the amount in persons with AD than in age-matched and time-of-death matched controls. In addition, the amount of AVP-mRNA was three times higher during the daytime than at night in control adults aged 60 to 80 years whereas no clear diurnal rhythm was observed in persons with AD. <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK> and colleagues emphasize that the reduction of AVP-mRNA in the SCN does not necessarily only reflect neuronal death; neurons may still be present but inactive, and no longer able to express AVP-mRNA. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Harper-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2008</LINK> revealed a circadian rhythm in patients with AD suggesting a more functional clock than had been previously supposed. Neurotensin neurons did not show a circadian rhythm when the count pattern was analysed, suggesting that neurotensin exerts its circadian effect through a different mechanism from AVP. These findings support the idea of a functional although perhaps not as robust SCN in AD.</P>
<P>The circadian pacemaker in the SCN is synchronized with the 24-hour day by 'zeitgebers', or triggers, of which light is the most important. Light falling on the retina is transduced into neural activity that reaches the SCN through the retinohypothalamic and possibly the geniculohypothalamic tracts. Light leads to changes in the firing rates of specialized neurons in the SCN that in turn affect circadian rhythms (<LINK REF="REF-van-Someren-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Someren 1996</LINK>). However, in older adults with dementia, most zeitgebers are reduced due to diminished social contacts, age-related deficiencies in the eye (for example macular degeneration, cataracts, blindness), and less exposure to sufficient outdoor or bright light (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>). Reduced sensory input is likely to lower the 'general level of excitement' that is thought to play an important role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Someren-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Someren 1996</LINK>). Thus, an environment weak in phase prompts coupled with neuropathological damage causing poor sensitivity to such prompts can result in circadian rhythm disorders. A decreased ability to maintain a stable circadian pattern of daytime arousal and nocturnal quiescence may contribute to sleep disruptions (<LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>), cognitive dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>), behavioural disturbances (for example agitation and sundowning) (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haffmans-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haffmans 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>), functional impairment (<LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>), and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>) in persons with dementia. All of these symptoms reduce the quality of life of the individual with dementia, while sleep disruptions and behavioural disturbances also contribute to the burden on family caregivers. The stress that such disturbances place on family caregivers in particular is an important factor in the decision to institutionalize their family member with dementia. </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-23 03:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Light therapy for persons with dementia may be delivered in a variety of ways, for example using a light box placed approximately one metre away from the participants at a height within their visual fields; a light visor worn on their heads; ceiling mounted light fixtures; or 'naturalistic' light therapy, known as dawn-dusk simulation, that mimics outdoor twilight transitions. The light therapy may be administered for varying lengths of time and at different times of the day. The results from recent research have shown some consensus that the actual empirical peak wavelength for stimulation of melanopsin cells to shift circadian rhythm is probably in the short wavelength light range (approximately 450 to 500 nm), that is in the blue to green range of the light spectrum (<LINK REF="REF-Nowak-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shirani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shirani 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared to treatment with psychotropic drugs, such as sedative hypnotics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, light therapy is a highly promising alternative with respect to adverse side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paniagua-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paniagua 2008</LINK>). When used to treat depression, seasonal affective disorder, or dementia, adverse effects of light therapy are typically reported to be mild and transient, and to occur less frequently than adverse effects of drug treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-25 17:43:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As described above, persons with dementia often experience a reduction in general sensory input and less exposure to bright environmental light, as well as having reduced sensitivity to the effect of light on the SCN. Light therapy, by providing additional sources of light, may act through specialized neurons in the SCN to promote the synchronization of internal circadian rhythms with the environmental light-dark cycles.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-23 03:17:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several studies have examined the effectiveness of light therapy in managing disturbances of cognition, ADLs, sleep, behaviour, and psychiatric disturbances in individuals with dementia. There is preliminary evidence from some studies (for example <LINK REF="STD-Gasio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK>
<U>;</U> <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>) that light therapy improves nocturnal sleep, while other studies (for example <LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skjerve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Skjerve 2004</LINK>) demonstrated no improvement in people with dementia. The conflicting results may be due to heterogeneity of the studied population with respect to underlying diagnosis, stage of disease, visual impairment; methodological features such as the timing of light exposure with respect to core body temperature; and baseline light conditions affecting light sensitivity (light history) (<LINK REF="REF-Shirani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shirani 2009</LINK>). Inconsistent results could also reflect bias in some of the studies. A systematic review of the evidence for light therapy is needed to determine whether or not light therapy is indeed effective in dementia and, if so, for which symptoms, and to explore the relationship between effectiveness and characteristics of treatment (for example light intensity, modality, time of administration, and duration).</P>

<P>The review authors included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which light therapy was compared with a control treatment. Studies should be at least single-blind.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>After merging search results and discarding duplicates, two authors (DF, ET) independently examined the titles and abstracts of citations. If a title or abstract appeared to represent our inclusion criteria, we retrieved the full article for further assessment. Two authors (DF, ET) then independently assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion in the review. The authors resolved disagreements by discussion or, if necessary, they referred to another author. The excluded articles and reasons for exclusion are listed in the &#8216;<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>&#8217; table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Four review authors (CB, PH, ET, SP) independently extracted data from the published articles including information regarding the publication date; authors; study setting; inclusion and exclusion criteria; participants&#8217; diagnosis, gender, age; type, duration, intensity, frequency, and time of day of light therapy; control activity; outcome data; dropout rates and reasons, adherence, adverse events; randomization process, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. They recorded these in the &#8216;<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>&#8217;. The mean change from baseline to final measurements and the standard deviation (SD) of the change were often not reported in the published reports. Accordingly, the authors extracted the final mean measurements, the SD of the final mean, and the number of participants for each group at each assessment. The included trials did not report any dichotomous data of interest to this review. The review authors compared their extracted data and resolved disagreements by consensus or including another author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The authors based the criteria for judging risk of bias on the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Version 5.1.0, chapter 8 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Four authors (CB, PH, ET, SP) independently assessed and rated the trials according to the risk of bias criteria listed below. The authors used an assessment tool (see table 8.5.d, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to determine if there was a low, high, or unclear risk of bias for each factor. The authors were not masked to the publication or author information. If the description of a process or outcome was unclear or missing, the authors contacted the original author of the trial in an attempt to retrieve the required information. Again, the authors resolved disagreements by discussion or, if necessary, by referral to a third author. They assessed the following criteria.</P>
<P>a. Selection bias, systematic differences between baseline characteristics of the groups that are compared</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of treatment effect </HEADING>
<P>Each trial and each outcome of interest required summary statistics. For continuous data, the effect measure was the mean difference (MD) when the pooled trials used the same rating scale or test to assess an outcome. We used the standardized mean difference (SMD), which is the absolute mean difference divided by the SD, when the pooled trials used different rating scales or tests. The statistical method used in the meta-analysis was inverse variance. We reported all outcomes using 95% confidence intervals. The included trials did not report any dichotomous data of interest to this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>The participants in the included trials were the unit of analysis. Although the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK> trial included clusters of 12 facilities, the analyses performed with the MLwiN software (version 2.0, Institute of Education, London, England) accounted for the three-level nested structure of the data set (that is a variable number of observations nested within participants and participants grouped in 12 facilities). Details are given in the online supplemental information (see <A HREF="http://www.jama.com">http://www.jama.com</A>). An estimate of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was not provided to determine effective sample sizes. However, the sample sizes included in the meta-analysis were not large (n = 74 to 87).</P>
<P>If a crossover design study was included, only the results prior to the crossover were considered for inclusion in our analysis. There were two crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK>) but we were unable to obtain the first period data and the analyses reported had not used appropriate methods for paired data. Hence, we were unable to include any data from these studies.</P>
<P>If a trial included three or more arms, we gave consideration to the nature of the intervention and control arms. If appropriate, we considered combining the data from two treatment arms that were similar and had the same control group, as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, section 16.5.4 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We combined the two treatment groups (morning and evening light therapy) in <LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2007_x002f_Dowling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2007/Dowling 2005</LINK> according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviewds of Interventions</I> (2011, 16.5.4).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK> reported only the combined findings of both the bright light therapy and dim red light groups because there were no significant differences between the groups. We requested group or individual data from the authors (29 October 2008) but these could not be obtained. Thus, the data from this study could not be included in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We found many types of information to be missing from the published articles, such as adequate descriptions of the process of randomization, blinding of outcome assessors, attrition and adherence to the light therapy, reasons for withdrawing, and required statistical data (that is means and standard deviations). We e-mailed contact authors at least twice over a two-month period and requested they provide the missing data. Some of these missing data are described in the risk of bias tables. The potential impact of the missing data on the results depended on the extent of the missing data, the pooled estimate of the treatment effect, and the variability of the outcomes. We also considered the variation in the degree of missing data as a potential source of heterogeneity. If available, we used intention-to-treat (ITT) data and if not available, we only used the reported completers&#8217; data in the analyses.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We included  trials that used a variety of light therapy approaches as the intervention and that examined similar outcomes to those in our meta-analyses. However, when the intensity of the light therapy was very different (for example the dawn-dusk simulation intervention compared with bright light) we conducted a separate analysis. We initially explored heterogeneity through a visual exploration of the forest plots. We then performed a test for statistical heterogeneity (a consequence of clinical or methodological diversity, or both, among trials) using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (P &lt; 0.10) and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. I<SUP>2</SUP> is a useful statistic for quantifying inconsistency (I<SUP>2</SUP> = [(Q - df)/Q] x 100%, where Q is the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic and df is its degrees of freedom) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This describes the percentage of variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). If I<SUP>2</SUP> equals 0% then there is no apparent heterogeneity, larger values (&#8805; 70%) indicate greater heterogeneity and caution should be used in interpreting the meta-analysis). We considered a value greater than 50% to be substantial heterogeneity, and we attempted to explain this variation. We presented the overall estimate from a fixed-effect model if the value was less than 30%. If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the population or treatment effect, or both, between trials then we used a random-effects model. In this case the confidence intervals were broader than those of a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>There were too few studies included in any of the meta-analyses to use funnel plots to examine possible publication bias. To investigate reporting biases within our included studies, we compared outcomes listed in the methods sections with reported results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Random sequence generation (selection bias) </HEADING>
<P>The process of randomization was assessed based on how the authors determined the allocation of participants to either a treatment or control group. Six of the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2007_x002f_Dowling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2007/Dowling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graf-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Graf 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>) were contacted to determine the method of random sequence generation as the descriptions in the published articles were incomplete. A response was received from all authors except <LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>In one study the risk of bias from random sequence generation was rated as high (<LINK REF="STD-Graf-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Graf 2001</LINK>) and in two studies it was rated as unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>This updated review included two new trials, resulting in a total of 11 trials (13 articles). The number of participants in the included trials was 499.<B> </B>Of these participants, 398 to 399 completed the protocol (the range reflects the different outcomes measured in the <LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK> trial). Most participants were older persons with AD. The light therapy was most frequently administered through a light box. However, a dawn-dusk simulator, cap visor, and ceiling mounted fixtures with Plexiglass diffusers containing florescent tubes were also light therapy sources.</P>
<P>Pooled data (<LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2007_x002f_Dowling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2007/Dowling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>) resulted in a significant decrease in the number of night time awakenings at the endpoint of the treatment. Including only the studies that incorporated morning bright light (<LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>) resulted in a larger significant finding. However, when the <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK> study was removed the results were no longer significant and no significant effect was revealed at two weeks, four weeks, and six weeks of follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>). One study in this review demonstrated that light therapy had a positive effect on one outcome of interest, ADLs. The <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK> study revealed that light therapy had a positive effect on the treatment group in attenuating the increase in ADL limitations after six weeks and after two years of light therapy. The sample size was adequate at six weeks (n = 87) but by two years the sample size was reduced to 26 participants. No significant evidence was found that light therapy decreased the decline in cognition, shortened sleep latency time, increased sleep duration and efficacy, decreased night time activity counts, decreased challenging behaviours, or improved psychiatric symptoms including depression. Indeed, the four included trials that examined challenging behaviours (that is agitation) revealed that light therapy was not effective when administered in the morning, afternoon, evening, or all day at from 10 days to 10 weeks and with treatment lasting up to two years.</P>
<P>There were insufficient numbers of trials to be able to conduct subgroup analyses that would determine which modality of light therapy, at what time of day, intensity and duration, is most beneficial for specific types and severities of dementia. No RCTs were retrieved that measured the other outcomes of interest, namely changes in rates of institutionalization or impact on cost of care. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK>) examined adverse effects of light therapy. Only <LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK> reported an increase in agitated behaviour in five participants. No other significant adverse effects were reported. The remaining studies did not report on adverse events. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall completeness and applicability of the results</HEADING>
<P>Most included studies examined aspects of sleep (n = 8) and challenging behaviours (n = 6). The remaining primary outcomes of interest were examined by fewer studies (one to six studies). None of the retrieved studies examined our secondary outcomes, which were rates of institutionalization and cost of care.</P>
<P>Among the included studies there was great variability in the intensity of the light therapy. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Gasio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasio 2003</LINK> used a Dawn-Dusk Simulator<SUP>TM</SUP> which exposed participants in the treatment group to a maximum of 400 lux, while the treatment groups in the remaining studies received light therapy ranging from 2500 to 10,000 lux. We did not consider it appropriate to combine the low exposure with the more intense exposures of light. This decision limited the number of included studies in each meta-analysis.</P>
<P>While most of the participants in the included studies were diagnosed with AD (82%), the remaining participants had vascular or mixed dementia or the type of dementia was not diagnosed. <LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2007_x002f_Dowling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2007/Dowling 2005</LINK>
<U>,</U> <LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 2008</LINK> included only participants with AD. This is an important design strategy as dementia should not be viewed as a single disease entity, and interventions such as light therapy may affect these conditions differently. Individuals with vascular dementia have heterogeneous brain pathology; their response to light therapy may depend on the areas in which ischaemic damage has occurred. The response to light therapy of individuals with scattered lesions of vascular dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK>) or with frontotemporal degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2001</LINK>) may differ from that of people with AD, who commonly have damage to the hippocampi and medial temporal lobes of the brain. Indeed, <LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK> reported that only the vascular dementia group showed a reduction in night time activity level, which may be explained by different origins of sleep and rhythm disturbances in persons with AD compared with those with vascular dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Mishima-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishima 1997</LINK>). Investigators need to be sensitive to the importance of controlling for these differences in pathology when designing studies of light therapy. Differences in severity of dementia may also influence the results. Unfortunately, because of the small sample sizes and small number of trials that examined each outcome, subgroup analyses could not be conducted.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK>) was based in the community, all the remaining trials were conducted in an institutional setting. However, light therapy modalities implemented in residential facilities may not translate readily to a home setting as they may be impractical, unacceptable, or overly expensive for the family caregiver and person with dementia residing in the community (<LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>). Most persons with dementia are cared for at home and most caregivers wish to keep their family member with dementia at home for as long as possible. Knowing how to support family caregivers and delay the symptoms of dementia will have profound benefits for all involved. In addition, enabling persons with dementia to remain in their homes for longer periods of time will lead to decreased healthcare costs. Further community-based trials are needed that examine the effect of light therapy on multiple domains of the people with dementia and the impact on their family caregivers.  </P>
<P>The non-significant results may have been related to small sample sizes, which contribute to insufficient power to detect a difference, if one is present. Notable exceptions were the <LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK> studies that included 92 participants, the <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK> trial that included 139 participants and their family caregivers, and the <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK> study that included 94 participants. Clearly further research with larger sample sizes is required, and that examines all of the outcomes of interest.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence may be impacted by the risk of bias associated with the random sequence generation and concealed allocation to groups. For example, it has been demonstrated that even with adequately concealed allocation sequence, trials with inadequate sequence generation yielded exaggerated estimates of intervention effects, on average, than trials with adequate sequence generation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). In our review, it was difficult to determine these processes for most of the trials, and the authors were often requested to provide more detailed information. Some authors responded and others did not. Increasingly more researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK>) reported using a computerized random number generator. In another three trials randomization was unclear, and in one case random selection was rated as high risk. A computer random number generator<I>
<B> </B>
</I>is the recommended approach to generating the random selection and allocation concealment to groups. Inadequate concealment includes randomization by use of case record numbers, dates of birth, admission dates, day of the week, and any procedure transparent before allocation, such as an open list of random numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several methodological studies have examined the effect of concealment of allocation sequence. A pooled analysis of seven methodological studies found that effect estimates from trials with inadequate concealment of allocation or unclear reporting of the technique used for concealment of allocation were on average 18% more &#8216;beneficial&#8217; than effect estimates from trials with adequate concealment of allocation (95% CI 5 to 29) (<LINK REF="REF-Pildal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pildal 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK> reported that the intervention effect estimates were exaggerated when there was inadequate allocation concealment in trials where a subjective outcome was analysed, but there was little evidence of bias in trials with objective outcomes.</P>
<P>Blinding of the participants and personnel was not an expectation of this review as the light therapy was often obvious to the participants and persons administering the light therapy. However, some researchers in the included trials were able to deceive the participants and personnel by informing them that the trial was examining the effectiveness of the colour<I> </I>of the light, and participants in both the light treatment and control groups sat in front of a light box.</P>
<P>We examined whether the outcome assessors were blinded as lack of blinding in trials has been shown to be associated with more exaggerated estimated intervention effects, by 9% on average, measured as odds ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Pildal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pildal 2007</LINK>). These studies included both subjective and objective outcomes. The estimated effect has been observed to be more biased, on average, in trials with more subjective outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). Although seven trials reported that the outcome assessors were blinded, in four trials the outcome assessors were not blinded.</P>
<P>While seven authors adequately reported on attrition rates, the remaining authors did not. <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK> provided excellent examples of reporting attrition through the use of a flow diagram that clearly described the reasons for attrition of participants in each group at specific points of time. Eight trial authors adequately described data for all of the outcomes of interest while three authors did not. This is apparently not unusual as missing data are common in medical journals and are often inadequately handled in the statistical analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> reported that several empirical studies found no clear evidence of bias associated with missing data (<LINK REF="REF-Balk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siersma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siersma 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2005</LINK> observed a tendency for analyses conducted after trial authors excluded participants to favour the experimental intervention compared with analyses that included all participants. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Porta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porta 2007</LINK> found more exaggerated effect estimates from &#8216;per protocol&#8217; analyses compared with intention-to-treat analyses of the same trials. Thus, when there is missing data an intention-to-treat analysis is recommended.</P>
<P>Other potential sources of bias were related to the reporting of compliance with the light therapy or wearing the activity monitor. Only five studies reported on these. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential bias in the review process </HEADING>
<P>This review was conducted as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), thus the introduction of bias during the review process was minimized. We are fairly confident that all relevant studies were identified as the literature searches were conducted by Anna<B> </B>Noel-Storr of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group and updated at least every six months.</P>
<P>Three included studies did not provide useable data for inclusion in the meta-analyses. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mishima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mishima 1998</LINK> used crossover designs and did not conduct analyses appropriate to a paired design, and <LINK REF="STD-Ancoli_x002d_Israel-2003a_x002f_b" TYPE="STUDY">Ancoli-Israel 2003a/b</LINK> only reported combined data from the treatment and control groups. This is unfortunate as the total number of trials that examined the effectiveness of light therapy in improving the symptoms of dementia is limited. It is important to include means and SDs for endpoint measures (before crossover) or change from baseline to final measurement scores for the treatment and control groups in published reports, or the authors should be willing to provide these data on request. Clearly, additional research is needed that examines these important outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Weldemichael-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weldemichael 2010</LINK>) and provides the needed data for meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Agreement and disagreement with other studies or reviews </HEADING>
<P>Recent systematic reviews on this topic have summarized research literature similar to the studies included in this review (for example <LINK REF="REF-David-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padilla-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padilla 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Salami-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salami 2011</LINK>
<B> </B>synthesized the qualitative and quantitative evidence (n = 38 studies; included five RCTs) on non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments of sleep disturbance in persons with AD. <LINK REF="REF-Salami-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salami 2011</LINK> concluded that bright light therapy demonstrated the best results as pharmacological agents produce inconsistent results and their use is limited by their potential adverse effects. </P>
<P>Our non-significant results related to challenging behaviours are supported by observational studies, for example <LINK REF="STD-Barrick-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrick 2010</LINK>, which examined the effect of ambient bright light therapy on agitation among institutionalized persons with dementia. Four ambient lighting conditions were included, morning bright light, afternoon bright light, all day bright light, and standard light (control). Results revealed that for participants with mild to moderate dementia, agitation was higher in all of the treatment conditions compared with the control. For persons with severe dementia there was also a trend toward being more agitated during morning light than standard light (P = 0.053). <LINK REF="STD-Barrick-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrick 2010</LINK> concluded that ambient bright light is not effective in reducing agitation in dementia and may exacerbate this behavioural symptom. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-02-24 16:45:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Riemersma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Riemersma 2008</LINK>) revealed that light therapy may have an effect in attenuating the increase in ADL limitations after six weeks (n = 87) and after two years (n = 26) but did not have an effect after one year (n = 55). It is thus premature to recommend the use of light therapy in practice. No significant adverse events related to the light therapy were reported except for a worsening of agitated behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 1999</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-02-23 06:41:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As there is limited evidence that light therapy may be effective in delaying deterioration in ADLs, further and better designed research is required. Research is needed to identify appropriate illumination intensity, frequency, interval, time of day (although trials that administered light therapy in the morning, afternoon, evening, and all day were included in this review), and length of intervention for individuals with different types and severities of dementia. Exploring different light therapy approaches (for example dawn-dusk simulation, cap visor, ambient light) is also required to ensure that the light therapy is acceptable to persons with dementia. Unless they are comfortable with the light therapy, there will be low compliance. Outcomes that contribute to quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers should be examined as well as cost implications and potential adverse effects of light therapy.</P>
<P>Further research is also needed using outdoor light, as the importance of exposing persons with dementia to outdoor light has been demonstrated (<LINK REF="STD-Connell-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2007</LINK>). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Connell-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2007</LINK> revealed that a daily structured activity program offered outdoors, compared with indoors, over a two week period improved maximum sleep duration for persons with dementia who participated in the outdoor program. Persons residing in the community and those residing in long-term care facilities with the assistance of healthcare aides or volunteers can greatly increase their daily light exposure by spending time outdoors. For example, the intensity of sunlight at midday measures over 100,000 lux (<LINK REF="REF-Shirani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shirani 2009</LINK>) and on a cloudy day it ranges from 8000 to 10,000 lux; interior daytime exposure sitting near windows equals approximately 1000 lux (<LINK REF="REF-McCurry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurry 2000</LINK>). Since exposure to outdoor light has many potential benefits for the person with dementia, their family caregivers, and formal care providers, this is a recommended area of future research.</P>
<P>Researchers should also attempt to accurately diagnose and determine the severity of the dementia as it is possible that persons with mild to moderate AD with more intact SCNs and who are more receptive to other zeitgebers or triggers will have a greater response to light. Clearly further research is needed to be able to develop best practice guidelines that would be helpful to healthcare providers in advising persons with dementia living in institutional and community settings.</P>
