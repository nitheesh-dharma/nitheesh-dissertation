<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Most women are able to give birth without serious damage to their perineum. However, severe perineal trauma, which affects the muscle or tissue in the back passage, occurs in 1% to 8% of women giving birth and is common when forceps are used. There is an increased chance of infection when this happens. Pain in this area can impact not only on a woman's daily activity but also on her relationship with her baby and her partner.</P>
<P>When a woman has a severe perineal tear during vaginal birth, there is thought to be an increased risk of infection. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent infection.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question<BR/>
<BR/>
</B>To assess how effective antibiotic prophylaxis is to prevent perineal wound infection compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent perineal wound infection and to compare different antibiotic regimens.</P>
<P>
<B>Main findings</B>
</P>
<P>The review identified one trial, involving 147 women. This trial was conducted to explore the benefit of routine prophylactic antibiotics (intervention group) versus placebo (control group) for women with severe perineal tears. The result showed fewer perineal wound complications in the intervention group at two weeks postpartum. There was no statistically significant difference in perineal wound complications before discharge and at six weeks' postpartum.</P>
<P>The one included study was terminated before it reached the pre-planned sample size and had a high rate of loss to follow-up</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The included study was of high methodological quality except for incomplete follow-up. We assessed reduction of perineal wound infection in third- or fourth-degree tear by antibiotic prophylaxis as low to moderate quality of the evidence. However, the results are based on one small trial and there was a high loss to follow-up. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-11 12:26:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>One to eight per cent of women suffer third-degree perineal tear (anal sphincter injury) and fourth-degree perineal tear (rectal mucosa injury) during vaginal birth, and these tears are more common after forceps delivery (28%) and midline episiotomies. Third- and fourth-degree tears can become contaminated with bacteria from the rectum and this significantly increases in the chance of perineal wound infection. Prophylactic antibiotics might have a role in preventing this infection.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:10:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>We identified and included one trial (147 women from a pre-planned sample size of 310 women) that compared the effect of prophylactic antibiotic (single-dose, second-generation cephalosporin - cefotetan or cefoxitin, 1 g intravenously) on postpartum perineal wound complications in third- or fourth-degree perineal tears compared with placebo. Perineal wound complications (wound disruption and purulent discharge) at the two-week postpartum check up were 8.20% and 24.10% in the treatment and the control groups respectively (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.96). However, the high failed-appointment rate may limit the generalisability of the results. The overall risk of bias was low except for incomplete outcome data. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was moderate for infection rate at two weeks' postpartum, and low for infection rate at six weeks' postpartum.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-08-11 14:52:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Although the data suggest that prophylactic antibiotics help to prevent perineal wound complications following third- or fourth-degree perineal tear, loss to follow-up was very high. The results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on one small trial.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:09:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Episiotomy is the incision in the perineal area to enlarge the vaginal orifice for easier vaginal birth. It consists of two types: midline or median and mediolateral style. Many studies have shown that routine episiotomy can cause such problems as persistent perineal pain, unsatisfied postpartum sexual function, and increasing anal sphincter injury leading to faecal or flatus incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Christianson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christianson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labrecque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrecque 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nager-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nager 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Signorello-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Signorello 2001</LINK>). Pain in this area can impact not only on a woman's daily activity but also on her relationship with her baby and her partner. A restrictive episiotomy policy (strict criteria to perform episiotomy only in proper cases such as short stature mother with short perineum, large size baby, or imminent severe laceration of perineum) has been in place for many years and is strongly supported by a Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 1999</LINK>). In addition, prenatal perineal massage has also been introduced into practice to prevent perineal tears (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eason-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johanson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labrecque-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrecque 1999</LINK>). One randomised controlled trial failed to show the effectiveness of perineal massage but concluded that it did no harm (<LINK REF="REF-Stamp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamp 2001</LINK>). A Cochrane review concluded that antenatal digital perineal massage reduces the incidence of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) (<LINK REF="REF-Beckmann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckmann 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most women are able to give birth without serious damage to the perineum, but 1% to 8% of women suffer severe perineal tears (anal sphincter injury, with or without rectal mucosa injury) during vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-De-Leeuw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leeuw 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riskin_x002d_Mashiah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riskin-Mashiah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuelsson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuelsson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuelsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuelsson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994</LINK>). These tears are more common after operative vaginal birth, especially when forceps are used. The incidence of severe perineal lacerations after the use of forceps has been reported as 21% for third-degree and 7% for fourth-degree tears (<LINK REF="REF-Bofill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bofill 1996</LINK>). Other risk factors include race (Asian women have the highest risk, perhaps due to small size mother and short perineum), midline episiotomy (short distance to anal sphincter), nulliparity (lesser elasticity than a multiparous mother), and high birthweight baby (<LINK REF="REF-De-Leeuw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leeuw 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homsi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homsi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labrecque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrecque 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nager-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nager 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:09:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>When a woman has a severe perineal tear during vaginal birth, there is thought to be an increased risk of infection. Laceration of the vagina and perineum during vaginal birth are classified as first-, second-, third- and fourth-degree tears. First-degree tears involve the vaginal mucosa and connective tissue. Second-degree tears involve the vaginal mucosa, connective tissue and underlying muscles. Third-degree tears involve a complete transection of anal sphincter and fourth-degree tears involve the rectal mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). When the rectal mucosa is ruptured, the wound is classified as contaminated (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1994</LINK>) or clean-contaminated (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). Antibiotic prophylaxis is generally used where wounds have become, or are likely to become, contaminated, such as in colorectal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Oates-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 1998</LINK>). A Cochrane review has also shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective in reducing puerperal morbidity after cesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2002</LINK>). On the other hand, a Cochrane review on antibiotic prophylaxis after operative vaginal birth could not conclude its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Liabsuetrakul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liabsuetrakul 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:09:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A woman contracting infection after a severe perineal tear may also be at risk of other morbidities as a result of the tear, such as haematoma, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse), incontinence and recto-vaginal fistula (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homsi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homsi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labrecque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrecque 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nager-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nager 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Signorello-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Signorello 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorensen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorensen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). While some authorities recommend that prophylactic antibiotics be used for severe perineal tears (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>), others have recommended against this course of action (<LINK REF="REF-Whitfield-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitfield 1995</LINK>). As widespread use of antibiotics may contribute to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Towers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towers 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1996</LINK>), the over-use of antibiotics is being discouraged by many groups.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-16 15:59:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is a low-cost, accessible intervention that may prevent considerable maternal morbidity. It is therefore important to establish the benefits of prophylactic antibiotics for infection after severe perineal tears, and also to assess whether there are any adverse effects on mother or infant, by systematically reviewing the evidence.</P>

<P>For methods used in the previous update, please see <LINK REF="REF-Buppasiri-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buppasiri 2010</LINK>. For this update no new studies were identified from the updated search. However, full risk of bias was performed for the included study and the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.</P>
<P>In future updates, the full methods outlined in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> will be used.</P>
<P>The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.</P>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-03 08:57:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). There were no disagreements. We would have resolved any disagreements through discussion or, if required, we would have involved a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the one included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomisation participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We described for the included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether the included study was at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see</I> <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS">Sensitivity analysis</A>.</P>
<P>For this update (2014) ,the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following key outcomes for the main comparison.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Fever or puerperal febrile morbidity.</LI>
<LI>Perineal wound infection or perineal wound disruption.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes were produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:13:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The one included study was terminated before it reached the pre-planned sample size and had a high rate of loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:13:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Procedures for adequate allocation concealment were well described in the study. We judged this study to be at low risk of bias for selection bias.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:13:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The process of blinding was described. The women, investigator and assessor were all blinded. We judged this study to be at low risk of bias for performance and detection bias.</P>
</BLINDING>
<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:13:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The planned number of women to be recruited was 310 (155 per arm). The actual number of women recruited was 147 (44.5%, 64 in treatment arm and 83 in control group). The study was terminated before the planned number of women was achieved. The loss to follow-up rate was high (27%, 40 in 147). The study was therefore considered to be at moderate risk of attrition bias for attrition bias.</P>

<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2014-07-30 13:15:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>The study was considered to be at low risk of selective reporting because the planned outcome measurement was prospectively registered in clinical trial registration.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2014-09-19 15:13:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Single-dose, second-generation cephalosporin intravenously (cefotetan or cefoxitin, 1 g, intravenously, or clindamycin, 900 mg intravenously if allergic to penicillin, in 100 mL of saline) was used as the intervention to prevent perineal wound infection or disruption in the third- or fourth-degree perineal tear compared with placebo (100 mL of normal saline intravenously) .</P>
<P>The primary outcome of the included study was gross disruption or purulent discharge at the site of perineal repair by two weeks postpartum.</P>
<P>Perineal wound complications at two weeks postpartum in the treatment and control groups were four of 49 (8.2%) and 14 of 58 (24.1%) respectively (P = 0.037, risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.96) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perineal wound infection before discharge and at six weeks postpartum was also reported. There were no perineal wound complications before hospital discharge in both groups. One hundred and twenty-eight women were checked at six weeks postpartum (19 of 147 (12.9%) did not come for follow-up at six weeks). There were perineal wound complications in four out of 55 (7.3%) and 14 out of 73 (19.2%) women in the treatment and control groups respectively, (P = 0.07, RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-16 16:12:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>There were marginally significantly fewer perineal wound complications at two weeks' postpartum in the intervention group. There was no statistically significant difference in perineal wound complications before discharge and at six weeks' postpartum.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-08-11 15:02:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The one included study, conducted in a developed country, with a relatively high loss of follow-up, provides insufficient data to address the objectives of this review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-22 10:56:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>The included study was of high methodological quality; most of the domains were judged to be at low risk of bias except for incomplete outcome data, which we assessed as at high risk of bias. We assessed perineal wound infection in third- or fourth-degree tear reduced significantly by antibiotic prophylaxis at two weeks' postpartum as moderate quality of the evidence and six weeks' postpartum as low quality of the evidence due to the small sample size and because the confidence interval overlaps 'no effect' (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We could not assess "1. Fever or puerperal febrile morbidity" because the outcome was not reported in the one included study. The inadequate sample size and high loss to follow-up rate do not allow us to draw a firm conclusion about the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in third- or fourth-degree perineal tear after vaginal birth.</P>

<P>Type of study: prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.</P>
<P>Method: randomisation was done by using a random-numbers table. Women were randomly assigned to a single dose of antibiotic (cefotetan or cefoxitin, 1 g, intravenously, or clindamycin, 900 mg intravenously if allergic to penicillin, in 100 mL of saline) or placebo (100 mL of normal saline intravenously). The nurse was instructed to open the envelope and administer the medication or placebo. The log book was kept in a secure location in medication room.</P>
<P>Placebo: yes, normal saline was used.</P>
<P>Sample size: to demonstrate a 75% reduction in perineal infection rate with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 310 women (155 on each arm) were needed. Only 147 women (83 in placebo group, 64 in treatment group) were enrolled in a 3-year period.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat basis: yes.</P>
<P>Loss to follow-up: 27.2% (40 of 147) women lost at 2-week postpartum check up. 107 women visited at 2-week postpartum check up. 23.4% (15 of 64) were missed in treatment group, and 30.1% (25 of 83) in control group. 19 of 147 (12.9%) women were lost to follow-up at the 6-week postpartum check up.</P>

<P>There were 310 preplanned women (155 in each arm). The authors decided to terminated the study after 3 years of enrolment because they could not achieve the preplanned number of women within a reasonable time period. Many women refused to participate and many missed enrolment due to busy labour and delivery wards. Only 147 women were recruited: 64 cases in intervention group and 83 in the control group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.</P>
<P>We will create a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included and excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. We will enter data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and check for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>Sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised-trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if the I² is greater than 30% and either the Tau² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. 
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we plan to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We plan to consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Immunocompromised versus not immunocompromised pregnant women, such as HIV infection, chronic steroid use.</LI>
<LI>Women with prolonged prelabour rupture membranes versus women without prolonged prelabour rupture membranes.</LI>
<LI>Women with preterm prelabour rupture membranes (PPROM) versus women without PPROM.</LI>
<LI>Third-degree tears compared with fourth-degree tears.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We will restrict subgroup analysis to the following outcomes.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Fever or puerperal febrile morbidity.</LI>
<LI>Perineal wound infection.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We will perform sensitivity analyses for aspects of the review that might affect primary outcomes (fever or puerperal febrile morbidity and perineal wound infection), such as where there was risk of bias associated with the quality of some of the included trials. We plan to carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of fixed-effect or random-effects analyses for primary outcomes with statistical heterogeneity.</P>
