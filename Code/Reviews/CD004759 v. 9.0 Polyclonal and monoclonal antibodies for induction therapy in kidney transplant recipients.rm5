<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>A kidney transplant is the best treatment for many people who have severe kidney disease to allow patients to return to work and feel better. Patients who receive a kidney transplant receive drugs to prevent their own body from rejecting the transplant - the aim of treatment is to prolong the function of the kidney transplant while minimising common long-term side effects of treatment such as cancer, infection, and diabetes. For some patients who have a much higher risk of rejection, additional treatment is given at the time of the operation (which may lower the body's ability to attack the kidney transplant and increase kidney function but can increase the risk of complications such as infection and cancer).</P>
<P>
<B>What did we do?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 29 August 2016 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies with placebo, no treatment, or other antibody therapy in adults and children who had received a kidney transplant.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 99 studies (265 records; 8956 participants; 33 with contemporary agents). From the available studies in this area, an antibody against human immune cells (ATG) reduces the chances of a patient having a kidney rejection by one-third, but it is uncertain whether this prolongs the function of the kidney transplant or survival for the patient. ATG significantly increases viral infections including cytomegalovirus. In addition, the effects of ATG treatment on cancer are not well understood. Alemtuzumab is another treatment which has been compared to ATG in patients who have received less or no steroid therapy as part of their transplant treatment. Treatment with alemtuzumab with lower steroid doses or no steroid treatment at all may lower a patient's risk of kidney rejection within a year after transplantation when compared to ATG but overall the information about treatment benefits and harms of alemtuzumab in many clinical situations are not certain. This means we are not confident about the effects of alemtuzumab on kidney function, patient survival or treatment side-effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Overall the available research on antibody treatment for kidney transplantation is limited when clinicians and patients make joint decisions about antibody therapy at the time of a kidney transplant because of the uncertain long term benefits and hazards of these treatments.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-13 16:36:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Prolonging kidney transplant survival is an important clinical priority. Induction immunosuppression with antibody therapy is recommended at transplantation and non-depleting interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies (IL2Ra) are considered first line. It is suggested that recipients at high risk of rejection should receive lymphocyte-depleting antibodies but the relative benefits and harms of the available agents are uncertain.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-28 12:07:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We included 99 studies (269 records; 8956 participants; 33 with contemporary agents). Methodology was incompletely reported in most studies leading to lower confidence in the treatment estimates.</P>
<P>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) prevented acute graft rejection (17 studies: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.78). The benefits of ATG on graft rejection were similar when used with (12 studies: RR 0.61, 0.49 to 0.76) or without (5 studies: RR 0.65, 0.43 to 0.98) calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) treatment. ATG (with CNI therapy) had uncertain effects on death (3 to 6 months, 3 studies: RR 0.41, 0.13 to 1.22; 1 to 2 years, 5 studies: RR 0.75, 0.27 to 2.06; 5 years, 2 studies: RR 0.94, 0.11 to 7.81) and graft loss (3 to 6 months, 4 studies: RR 0.60, 0.34 to 1.05; 1 to 2 years, 3 studies: RR 0.65, 0.36 to 1.19). The effect of ATG on death-censored graft loss was uncertain at 1 to 2 years and 5 years. In non-CNI studies, ATG had uncertain effects on death but reduced death-censored graft loss (6 studies: RR 0.55, 0.38 to 0.78). When CNI and older non-CNI studies were combined, a benefit was seen with ATG at 1 to 2 years for both all-cause graft loss (7 studies: RR 0.71, 0.53 to 0.95) and death-censored graft loss (8 studies: RR 0.55, 0.39 to 0.77) but not sustained longer term. ATG increased cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (6 studies: RR 1.55, 1.24 to 1.95), leucopenia (4 studies: RR 3.86, 2.79 to 5.34) and thrombocytopenia (4 studies: RR 2.41, 1.61 to 3.61) but had uncertain effects on delayed graft function, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT).</P>
<P>Alemtuzumab was compared to ATG in six studies (446 patients) with early steroid withdrawal (ESW) or steroid minimisation. Alemtuzumab plus steroid minimisation reduced acute rejection compared to ATG at one year (4 studies: RR 0.57, 0.35 to 0.93). In the two studies with ESW only in the alemtuzumab arm, the effect of alemtuzumab on acute rejection at 1 year was uncertain compared to ATG (RR 1.27, 0.50 to 3.19). Alemtuzumab had uncertain effects on death (1 year, 2 studies: RR 0.39, 0.06 to 2.42; 2 to 3 years, 3 studies: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.95), graft loss (1 year, 2 studies: RR 0.39, 0.13 to 1.30; 2 to 3 years, 3 studies: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.06), and death-censored graft loss (1 year, 2 studies: RR 0.38, 0.08 to 1.81; 2 to 3 years, 3 studies: RR 2.45, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.97) compared to ATG. Creatinine clearance was lower with alemtuzumab plus ESW at 6 months (2 studies: MD -13.35 mL/min, -23.91 to -2.80) and 2 years (2 studies: MD -12.86 mL/min, -23.73 to -2.00) compared to ATG plus triple maintenance. Across all 6 studies, the effect of alemtuzumab versus ATG was uncertain on all-cause infection, CMV infection, BK virus infection, malignancy, and PTLD. The effect of alemtuzumab with steroid minimisation on NODAT was uncertain, compared to ATG with steroid maintenance.</P>
<P>Alemtuzumab plus ESW compared with triple maintenance without induction therapy had uncertain effects on death and all-cause graft loss at 1 year, acute rejection at 6 months and 1 year. CMV infection was increased (2 studies: RR 2.28, 1.18 to 4.40). Treatment effects were uncertain for NODAT, thrombocytopenia, and malignancy or PTLD.</P>
<P>Rituximab had uncertain effects on death, graft loss, acute rejection and all other adverse outcomes compared to placebo.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 15:09:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>ATG reduces acute rejection but has uncertain effects on death, graft survival, malignancy and NODAT, and increases CMV infection, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. Given a 45% acute rejection risk without ATG induction, seven patients would need treatment to prevent one having rejection, while incurring an additional patient experiencing CMV disease for every 12 treated. Excluding non-CNI studies, the risk of rejection was 37% without induction with six patients needing treatment to prevent one having rejection. </P>
<P>In the context of steroid minimisation, alemtuzumab prevents acute rejection at 1 year compared to ATG. Eleven patients would require treatment with alemtuzumab to prevent 1 having rejection, assuming a 21% rejection risk with ATG.</P>
<P>Triple maintenance without induction therapy compared to alemtuzumab combined with ESW had similar rates of acute rejection but adverse effects including NODAT were poorly documented. Alemtuzumab plus steroid withdrawal would cause one additional patient experiencing CMV disease for every six patients treated compared to no induction and triple maintenance, in the absence of any clinical benefit. Overall, ATG and alemtuzumab decrease acute rejection at a cost of increased CMV disease while patient-centred outcomes (reduced death or lower toxicity) do not appear to be improved.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-13 11:10:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-23 11:15:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Penny Hill">
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) but demand exceeds supply from organ donors. Increasing this supply and prolonging kidney transplant survival are therefore important for patients and health systems (<LINK REF="REF-Tonelli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonelli 2011</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-13 11:10:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Immunosuppressive therapy consists of initial induction and maintenance regimens to prevent rejection. Induction may be defined as treatment with a biologic agent either before, at the time of, or immediately after transplantation to deplete or modulate T cell responses at the time of antigen presentation. Maintenance immunosuppression protocols usually involve three drugs acting on different parts of the T-cell activation or proliferation cascade: calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (e.g. cyclosporin (CSA), tacrolimus), antiproliferative agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone) (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Induction immunosuppression with antibody therapy is now recommended at the time of transplantation for all patients (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2009</LINK>). Antibody therapies are monoclonal or polyclonal, and depleting or non-depleting of lymphocytes. Non-depleting interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies (IL2Ra) are considered first line but it is suggested that recipients at high risk of rejection (e.g. children, subsequent transplants, certain racial groups such as African-Americans, and other sensitised patients) should receive lymphocyte-depleting antibodies. Depleting antibodies are also used for those at risk of delayed graft function to delay the introduction of full dose CNI, which can prolong the duration of acute tubular necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1999</LINK>). Depleting antibodies include polyclonal antibodies against the human lymphocyte (antilymphocyte globulin (ALG); antithymocyte globulin (ATG)).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-13 11:10:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Depleting antibodies bind to target immune effector cells leading to complement mediated destruction. Non-depleting antibodies bind to targets on effector cells preventing their interaction with other cells rendering them ineffective, but do not lead to cell destruction.</P>
<P>Most antibodies used in transplantation have been directed at T cells. Significant reduction in circulating T-effector cells is rapidly observed, leading to impaired cell mediated immunity (the desired effect to prevent kidney transplant rejection). A number of different preparations of ATG have been produced over the last few decades. These can be broadly divided into horse ATG (hATG), derived from horse serum after immunisation of horses with human thymocytes, and rabbit ATG (rATG), derived from rabbit serum. There are currently two or three standardised preparations available globally. Historical ATG preparations used in early studies were less standardised compared to the preparations currently available. Even though both hATG and rATG contain antibodies to a wide variety of T-cell antigens and MHC antigens, it is likely that the effects are not equal given that the two types are prepared differently. One study assessing both efficacy and safety clearly showed differences between these two preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Monomurab-CD3 is a murine monoclonal antibody against the CD3 receptor on activated T cells (Orthoclone OKT3) which became available in the late 1980s. OKT3 removes the functional T-cell population from circulation, producing immunosuppression useful for both induction therapy and the management of acute rejection. However, this profound immunosuppression is associated with immediate toxicity (cytokine release syndrome) and higher rates of infection and malignancy than standard triple therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Soulillou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soulillou 2001</LINK>). Use of these preparations may also be limited by the development of neutralising antibodies to their xenogeneic components (<LINK REF="REF-Kreis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreis 1992</LINK>). Use of OKT3 for both induction and treatment of acute rejection has declined in many countries over recent years due to the side effect profile. Janssen-Cilag discontinued the manufacture of OKT3 in 2010 due to a combination of declining sales and evidence from a Cochrane review on treatment of acute rejection confirming that OKT3 was associated with increased side effects compared to newer biologic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, the IL2Ra basiliximab and daclizumab have been used in the induction phase. IL2Ra are IgG monoclonal antibodies to the interleukin-2 receptor found only on activated T cells. IL2Ra are more specific immunosuppressants, with no immediate toxicity, and are increasingly used as induction agents, but not for treating acute rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Cibrik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cibrik 2001</LINK>). These agents are investigated in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>) and so will not be considered here.</P>
<P>Other antibodies have also been introduced for kidney transplantation induction such as alemtuzumab. This humanised CD-52 specific complement fixing monoclonal antibody was first used for induction by <LINK REF="REF-Calne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calne 1999</LINK>. Alemtuzumab causes profound depletion of T-cells from peripheral blood and also less marked depletion of other mononuclear cells.</P>
<P>Although the majority of current anti-rejection therapies are targeted at T-cell mechanisms, there is increasing evidence that B-cells may have a role due to their ability to act as antigen presenting cells and T-cell activators (<LINK REF="REF-Zand-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zand 2007</LINK>). For this reason the B-cell depleting anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab is also being used in kidney transplantation. Initially this was used in studies for ABO-incompatible kidney transplants at induction (<LINK REF="REF-Tyden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyden 2003</LINK>) but is now being considered for selected patients in some centres. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-13 11:10:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Favoured antibody preparations and rates of use differ from country to country and among transplant units. In 2007 in the USA, 78% of recipients received an antibody preparation as part of induction immunosuppression. Forty five per cent of kidney recipients received ATG, 1% OKT3, 27% IL2Ra and 10% received alemtuzumab (<LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2011</LINK>). In Australia, 93% of patients received an IL2Ra in 2008 and 5% to 10% received an additional or alternative antibody preparation (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2009</LINK>). There has clearly been an increase in use of antibody induction therapy over the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2011</LINK>) but there is still a large amount of variability in the type of antibody preparation used. This reflects local policies to some extent but there is also uncertainty, in particular in patients at high risk of rejection, as to whether one agent is superior to another. In patients at higher risk of rejection, increased risk of side effects may be acceptable if a treatment is more effective at reducing the risk of acute rejection, leading to improved rates of allograft and patient survival. </P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the relative short and long-term beneficial and adverse effects of different antibody preparations (except IL2Ra) used as induction in kidney transplant recipients. A previous Cochrane review looks at the use of antibodies for treatment of acute rejection episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2006</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study existed, records were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancy between published versions was to be highlighted. Where duplicate publication was suspected authors were contacted for clarification and if duplication was confirmed the initial full publication together with any subsequent publication which adds additional information (e.g. longer term follow-up data) was included in the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>We have presented the main results of the review in 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined, and the sum of the available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reported outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The reporting of outcome measures was variable across studies: 83 reported patient death, 70 reported all-cause graft loss and 24 death-censored graft loss while 84 reported acute rejection and 42 reported delayed graft function (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Acute rejection was reported in a further seven studies but could not be used in meta-analysis as rejection was either reported without actual figures or reported as total number of episodes rather than number of participants. Graft function was reported at a variety of time points in 33 studies. Some studies reporting graft function could not be included in meta-analysis as there was no SD or SE reported. Reporting of harms was more limited and inconsistent among studies. Participants with any serious infection were reported in 61 (66%) studies, however a further 7 studies also assessed infection, but expressed their results as &#8216;infectious episodes&#8217;, or reported no actual figures and so this data could not be easily meaningfully combined. CMV infection was reported in 35 studies and BKV infection in only 7 studies. Malignancy and PTLD were reported in only 30 studies and NODAT in 12. Haematological effects were reported in very few studies; 16 reported leucopenia and 12 thrombocytopenia. Very small numbers of studies reported other adverse outcomes including serum sickness, tremor, headache, chronic allograft nephropathy (on biopsy) and failure to complete induction therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dose comparisons</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2008</LINK> assessed single versus divided dose ATG. There were no differences in any reported outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Abouna-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abouna 1995</LINK> compared ATG adjusted for the CD3 count with fixed dose ATG and again there was no difference in outcomes. One very small study by <LINK REF="STD-Ata-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ata 2013</LINK> compared ATG with dose adjusted by CD3 count compared to dose adjusted for total lymphocyte count and there was no difference in outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Grafals-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Grafals 2014</LINK> compared 'standard' dose ATG (3.75 mg/kg total) with low dose ATG (2.25 mg/kg total) and found no significant difference in outcomes. Another very small study by <LINK REF="STD-Buchler-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Buchler 2013</LINK> compared a split of four versus two doses of ATG (same total dose of 6 mg/kg) and found no difference in outcomes. Two studies compared different OKT3 dose regimens: standard versus low dose (<LINK REF="STD-Norman-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Norman 1993a</LINK>) and standard versus high dose (<LINK REF="STD-Abramowicz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Abramowicz 1994</LINK>). There were no significant differences in either of these small studies. Low versus high dose ALG was also assessed in <LINK REF="STD-Sakhrani-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sakhrani 1992</LINK> and seven days versus 14 days ALG was addressed in <LINK REF="STD-Grundmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Grundmann 1987</LINK>. There were no differences in the low versus high dose study. Treatment was frequently stopped early in the 14 day group but there were no other differences in outcomes. One older study by <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1977</LINK> comparing low potency ALG with high potency ALG found increased acute rejection at three months (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.55 to 11.00) and increased graft loss at 1 year (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.90) with the low potency ALG.</P>

<P>Anti-CD2 rat monoclonal antibody was compared with no induction treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Squifflet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Squifflet 1997</LINK>. This small study (40 participants) showed acute rejection was decreased by anti-CD2 (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.96) but no difference in any other outcomes. Another small study compared anti CD7 with OKT3 (<LINK REF="STD-Lazarovits-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lazarovits 1993</LINK>) and there were no differences. Two studies assessed anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody: one in comparison with no induction agent (<LINK REF="STD-Spillner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Spillner 1998</LINK>) and the other in comparison with ATG (<LINK REF="STD-Hourmant-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hourmant 1996</LINK>). Other than decreased fever with anti-LFA-1 compared to ATG, differences were not significant in either of these studies. One small pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Ejaz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ejaz 2013</LINK>) comparing four different interventions (ATG versus ATG + rituximab versus ATG + bortezomib versus ATG + rituximab + bortezomib) did not show any significant differences in outcomes other than an increase in new-onset peripheral neuropathy in the bortezomib groups. There were only 10 participants in each group and follow-up only reported to one year at the time of this review. One final study compared anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-EARTS-Study-1999" TYPE="STUDY">EARTS Study 1999</LINK>) but again there were no differences in outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Norrby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Norrby 1997</LINK> compared two rabbit ATG preparations made by different manufacturers. There was no difference for the only reported outcomes of acute rejection and CMV infection. One small (51 participants) study by <LINK REF="STD-Steinmuller-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Steinmuller 1991</LINK> compared OKT3 with ALG but antibody therapy was only given for patients with delayed graft function. For this reason it was considered separately from the other studies comparing OKT3 and ALG. Side effects were reduced with ALG compared to OKT3 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72) but there were no other significant differences in outcomes. Finally <LINK REF="STD-Toledo_x002d_Pereyra-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Toledo-Pereyra 1985</LINK> compared ATG with ALG also showed no significant differences in outcomes.</P>

<P>Many antibody preparations are now available for induction immunosuppression in kidney transplantation and we sought to summarise the evidence in this review to help inform clinical decision making and policy. Our inclusion criteria were deliberately broad resulting in 28 different pairwise comparisons and studies spanning over many decades. This review provides the best summary available of all RCTs (excluding IL2Ra) and highlights several issues.</P>
<P>Firstly, the evidence basis for decision making is poorly informed by studies in this area. The effects of polyclonal antibody induction remain uncertain for many important outcomes including graft loss and death. Many relevant, well recognised potential harms are not reported frequently in RCTs and more well designed studies reporting patient-centred outcomes (benefits and harms) are required. Some effects of antibody induction could be quantified.</P>
<P>ATG reduced acute rejection rates by roughly one third when compared to placebo or no treatment, at the cost of approximately 50% increase in the risk of CMV complications and an uncertain impact on future malignancy risk. rATG reduces acute rejection compared to hATG but data supporting this is weak as all events were only reported in a single study. The only significant difference seen in comparisons between alemtuzumab and ATG in steroid avoidance studies was that alemtuzumab reduces rejection at one year; in comparison alemtuzumab increased CMV infection but had similar rejection rates when compared to no induction and triple maintenance. NODAT was not reduced with alemtuzumab plus ESW compared to triple maintenance. OKT3 decreases acute rejection compared to placebo or no treatment but has been withdrawn from clinical use due to a poor side effect profile. ALG prevented acute rejection and led to better kidney function at one year post-transplant compared with placebo or no treatment but increased the rates of all viral infections.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 10:51:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>A decision was made to include any co-intervention immunosuppression regimens to ensure all relevant studies were included. As a result, a large number of studies from the pre-CNI era were included which may not be relevant to clinical practice today. Where possible, results were separated into CNI or non-CNI maintenance as combining these groups was not felt to be clinically useful. As a result, there were multiple subgroups for outcomes of death and graft loss for most comparisons as studies frequently reported these outcomes at a variety of time points. There were no benefits seen for improved patient or graft survival with ATG despite decreased rejection rates when CNI and non-CNI studies were separated. This lack of benefit may be due to small numbers of studies in each subgroup. When CNI and non-CNI studies were combined, a reduction in both all-cause graft loss and death-censored graft loss was seen at one to two years post-transplant. This benefit was not sustained however in the studies that assessed longer term graft survival at five years. Results for acute rejection were generally more robust as this was reported in nearly all studies and time points were more standardised resulting in larger subgroups and greater statistical power. New studies are required to see if the absence of benefit is due to a lack of power or whether there really is no effect of one antibody compared to another antibody or placebo on patient and graft survival.</P>
<P>The main aim of using alemtuzumab has been to try to reduce the doses of maintenance immunosuppression required to prevent rejection, especially steroids. It is hoped that this will reduce some of the long term side effects of steroids, including NODAT. However, NODAT was not reduced with alemtuzumab plus ESW compared to ATG and triple maintenance or with alemtuzumab plus ESW compared to triple maintenance alone. This may be partly due to small numbers in these studies or may be due to the role of CNI, especially tacrolimus also causing increased rates of NODAT. Other steroid side effects have generally not been well reported in these studies. In the absence of any data to confirm a reduction in side effects, it is difficult to support the use of alemtuzumab and ESW currently compared to another antibody with triple maintenance.</P>
<P>The applicability of the results of this meta-analysis to the general transplant population may be limited by the individual studies. The majority of studies included patient groups with mixed immunological risk and a small number studied higher risk groups. Benefits and harms of individual treatments generally seemed homogenous across studies despite these apparent differences in risk. Harms are frequently under-reported in clinical studies compared to benefits and this review may therefore underestimate some of the potential harms of treatments due to possible under-reporting in the individual studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-28 12:07:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was generally low to only moderately good by GRADE criteria. <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> shows the individual biases for each study. The most common problem was potential selection bias due to unclear methods of both randomisation and allocation concealment. Only 20% to 27% of included studies were low risk of bias for either random sequence generation or allocation concealment (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the main comparison of ATG versus placebo, quality of evidence according to GRADE criteria was moderate for outcomes of acute rejection and CMV infection but low for all other outcomes. The evidence for acute rejection and CMV was graded as moderate rather than high as more than 50% of studies rated methods of allocation concealment and/or random sequence generation as &#8216;unclear&#8217; or &#8216;high risk&#8217; as a potential source of bias. For the comparison of alemtuzumab plus ESW versus ATG with and without ESW, the evidence for acute rejection was rated as moderate quality but evidence for all other outcomes was either low or very low quality by GRADE criteria. Again the main reason for acute rejection evidence being graded as moderate rather than high was a significant risk of selection bias due to poor reporting of randomisation and allocation concealment.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-28 12:07:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>One study of registry data of transplant recipients in the US also failed to show any improvement in all-cause graft survival despite decreasing rates of acute rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Meier_x002d_Kriesche-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier-Kriesche 2004</LINK>). More alarmingly, this study showed a trend towards worsening death censored graft survival, despite more potent maintenance immunosuppression. However, given these trends are taken from registry data, it is hard to interpret what this really means, especially with older and more co-morbid patients being transplanted in recent years.</P>
<P>Many antibody therapies have now shown a reduction in acute rejection but it remains uncertain as to whether this translates into increased patient or graft survival for any of the antibodies in this review. In comparison, there was a reduction in graft loss at one year (but not after) for IL2Ra compared to placebo (24 studies, 4672 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.90) in a systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>. However, there was no difference for graft loss when IL2Ra and ATG were compared in the same review and clinically diagnosed acute rejection rates were also similar for IL2Ra and ATG. However, ATG increased early malignancy at one year compared to IL2Ra (7 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.87) but had no effect on malignancy at other time points (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>). It is possible that malignancy is influenced more by maintenance immunosuppression than induction agents given it is a relatively late complication after transplantation. However, under-reporting of late harms is common in RCTs and malignancy rates may therefore be grossly underestimated in existing studies of induction agents leading to insufficient power to determine true cancer risk.</P>
<P>In steroid avoidance studies, alemtuzumab reduced acute rejection compared to ATG when ESW was used in both arms. These results would support using alemtuzumab over ATG in patients deemed to be at particularly high risk of steroid side effects and where maintenance with ESW is planned. Further studies of alemtuzumab and ESW compared to no induction and triple maintenance showed similar rates of acute rejection but an increased risk of CMV infection with alemtuzumab. There was no other difference in harms but this may need larger studies to show potential benefits of alemtuzumab relating to steroid avoidance. Reduction of maintenance immunosuppression certainly has theoretical benefits, including reduction in antihypertensives, antihyperlipidaemics, cholesterol, cataracts and NODAT requiring treatment as well as possible reduction of late complications such as malignancy. However, none of the studies to date have been long enough duration or large enough to confirm any of these suggested benefits. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-13 11:16:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Given a 45% acute rejection risk with no induction (assumed risk from control group in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), seven patients would need ATG to prevent one from experiencing acute transplant rejection, while one additional patient would experience CMV disease for every 12 patients treated with ATG. Where only studies including CNI maintenance were assessed, the acute rejection rate was 37% with no induction and six patients would need treatment with ATG to prevent one person having acute rejection. In steroid withdrawal studies, 11 patients would require alemtuzumab to prevent one patient experiencing rejection given a 21% rejection risk with ATG. Alemtuzumab treatment combined with steroid withdrawal would cause one additional patient experiencing CMV disease for every six patients treated when compared with no antibody induction and triple maintenance, and without apparent benefits to patient-centred outcomes. ATG and alemtuzumab decreased acute rejection at a cost of increased CMV while patient-centred outcomes including survival or side effects do not appear to be improved.</P>
<P>In kidney transplant recipients deemed to be at high risk of rejection, the evidence remains unclear as to whether one particular antibody preparation is better than any other at preventing acute rejection. However, this review does suggest that the perceived benefit of induction immunosuppression in reducing acute rejection may not actually lead to any long-term benefits or improvements in patient-centred outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-13 11:17:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Longer term follow-up is always a problem when assessing study data. Although some of the studies in this review have reported fairly long-term data, the numbers are generally too small to draw conclusions. Longer term follow-up is needed to really establish whether the benefit of reduced acute rejection with ATG has a significant impact on graft survival or indeed patient survival. In the absence of this information, is it possible to say that decreasing acute rejection is truly a benefit? Reducing the risk of acute rejection becomes less important to an individual patient if this fails to improve long-term graft or patient survival, especially if the treatment causes potential severe side effects and other harms. We need to find better ways of monitoring long-term harmful outcomes such as malignancy in any future studies. This may require an ongoing observational cohort study of patients once the initial RCT phase of a study is completed. Another response to this issue is follow up within established registries combined with core patient outcome sets.</P>
<P>If ESW or steroid minimisation is planned in an individual patient, the data in this review would support use of alemtuzumab over ATG due to a reduction in acute rejection. Further studies with long-term follow-up or ongoing follow-up of existing studies are needed to show if there is sustained benefit to steroid reduction therapy and indeed if the benefits outweigh risks of increased chronic rejection and potential increased long-term graft loss.</P>
<P>When assessing outcomes in transplantation it is difficult to separate the contribution of induction immunosuppression versus maintenance immunosuppression. The appropriate question for future studies may relate to maintenance rather than induction immunosuppression. Increasing knowledge in the field of transplant immunology has led to continual reassessment of the Banff diagnostic criteria and a much greater understanding of antibody-mediated rejection over recent years. Future studies comparing different immunosuppression regimens need to assess for not only differences in all cause rejection but also differences in the different subgroups of rejection. Ideally study designs should also include some measure of adherence to maintenance immunosuppression as this is particularly relevant for antibody-mediated rejection in the presence of de novo donor-specific antibodies. Adherence can be difficult to measure and is generally poorly reported or not measured at all in studies. However, this may be the area that really needs to be studied if we want to increase long term patient and graft survival in kidney transplantation.</P>
