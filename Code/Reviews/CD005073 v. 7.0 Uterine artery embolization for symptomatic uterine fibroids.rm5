General comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well researched and written review but there is a lot of work to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Terminology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needs some attention to copy editing, grammatical editing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the review, there is a scattering of inappropriate tenses for example in Risk of bias section, secondary outcomes, data synthesis etc. you use the future tense &amp;#8220;will&amp;#8221;. However, all these things are supposed to have been completed. You shouldn't be using the future tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to pay attention to tense used in abstract in results section some results are in present tense and some in past tense. Also in results subheading, I would put in brackets how you define &amp;#8220;long term&amp;#8221; it is in the conclusion but each subheading should stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the main results section please structure according to the two comparisons and then the primary outcomes.&amp;#160; For example the sentence &amp;#8220;the mean dominant fibroid volume decreased by 51%&amp;#8221;. This is a secondary outcome and the sentence does say which comparison it refers to. Can you please add the ORs and 95% CI to this section. The 5 year data seems to be very important and yet it is not in the authors conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.Plain Language summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall it is too detailed. Please try and avoid reporting on the individual studies. It is meant to be a summary of the results of the review not the individual studies.

The principles for outcomes is that they should be patient centered and that there should not be too many of them 5-10 is ideal. You have more than 20 across the data graphs and many of them are not in the protocol. I have said it later on but just because an outcome is in a paper it doesn't not mean it should be in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the background the word myomata is used.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-16 14:33:32 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is uterine artery embolization a safe and effective alternative treatment in women with symptomatic fibroids?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Uterine fibroids (benign tumours) can cause varied symptoms such as heavy bleeding, pain and reduced likelihood of pregnancy. Surgery (hysterectomy or myomectomy) has traditionally been the main treatment option but it carries a risk of complications. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a newer treatment option which blocks the blood supply to the womb and thus shrinks the fibroids and reduces their effects. The evidence was current to April 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>There were seven studies included in the review (793 participants). Three of these compared UAE with hysterectomy, two studies compared UAE with myomectomy, and another two with hysterectomy or myomectomy. The studies differed in their outcomes and length of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>With regard to patient satisfaction rates, our findings were consistent with satisfaction rates being up to 41% lower or up to 48% higher with UAE compared to surgery within 24 months of having the procedure. Findings on satisfaction rates were also inconclusive at five years of follow-up.</P>
<P>There was very low quality evidence to suggest that fertility outcomes (live birth and pregnancy) may be better after myomectomy than after UAE, but this evidence was based on a small selected subgroup and should be regarded with extreme caution. The UAE group had a shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to daily activities. With regards to safety, the evidence on major complications was inconclusive and consistent with benefit or harm, or no difference, from either intervention. However, the risk of minor complications was higher after UAE. Moreover, there was a higher likelihood of needing another surgical intervention after UAE, at two year and at five year follow-up. If we assumed that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. Therefore, it appears that while UAE is a safe option with an earlier initial recovery, it does carry a higher risk of minor complications and the need for further surgery later on.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence varied from very low for live birth, to moderate for satisfaction ratings and for most safety outcomes. The main limitations in the evidence were serious imprecision, failure to clearly report methods, and lack of blinding for subjective outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-12-13 16:52:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uterine fibroids cause heavy prolonged bleeding, pain, pressure symptoms and subfertility. The traditional method of treatment has been surgery as medical therapies have not proven effective. Uterine artery embolization has been reported to be an effective and safe alternative to treat fibroids in women not desiring future fertility. There is a significant body of evidence that is based on case controlled studies and case reports. This is an update of the review previously published in 2012.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-03-20 14:44:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the benefits and risks of uterine artery embolization (UAE) versus other medical or surgical interventions for symptomatic uterine fibroids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-12-13 18:17:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched sources including the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries. The search was last conducted in April 2014. We contacted authors of eligible randomised controlled trials to request unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-12-13 16:54:50 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of UAE versus any medical or surgical therapy for symptomatic uterine fibroids. The primary outcomes of the review were patient satisfaction and live birth rate (among women seeking live birth).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-02 13:05:50 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two of the authors (AS and JKG) independently selected studies, assessed quality and extracted data. Evidence quality was assessed using GRADE methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-16 14:44:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Seven RCTs with 793 women were included in this review. Three trials compared UAE with abdominal hysterectomy, two trials compared UAE with myomectomy, and two trials compared UAE with either type of surgery (53 hysterectomies and 62 myomectomies).</P>
<P>With regard to patient satisfaction rates, our findings were consistent with satisfaction rates being up to 41% lower or up to 48% higher with UAE compared to surgery within 24 months of having the procedure (odds ratio (OR) 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.48, 6 trials, 640 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 5%, moderate quality evidence). Findings were also inconclusive at five years of follow-up (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.80, 2 trials, 295 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was some indication that UAE may be associated with less favourable fertility outcomes than myomectomy, but it was very low quality evidence from a subgroup of a single study and should be regarded with extreme caution (live birth: OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.84; pregnancy: OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.85, 1 study, 66 women).</P>
<P>Similarly, for several safety outcomes our findings showed evidence of a substantially higher risk of adverse events in either arm or of no difference between the groups. This applied to intra-procedural complications (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.97, 4 trials, 452 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 40%, low quality evidence), major complications within one year (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.26, 5 trials, 611 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 4%, moderate quality evidence) and major complications within five years (OR 0.56; CI 0.27 to 1.18, 2 trials, 268 women). However, the rate of minor complications within one year was higher in the UAE group (OR 1.99; CI 1.41 to 2.81, 6 trials, 735 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, moderate quality evidence) and two trials found a higher minor complication rate in the UAE group at up to five years (OR 2.93; CI 1.73 to 4.93, 2 trials, 268 women).</P>
<P>UAE was associated with a higher rate of further surgical interventions (re-interventions within 2 years: OR 3.72; 95% CI 2.28 to 6.04, 6 trials, 732 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 45%, moderate quality evidence; within 5 years: OR 5.79; 95% CI 2.65 to 12.65, 2 trials, 289 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 65%). If we assumed that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE.</P>
<P>The evidence suggested that women in the UAE group were less likely to require a blood transfusion than women receiving surgery (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.52, 2 trials, 277 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). UAE was also associated with a shorter procedural time (two studies), shorter length of hospital stay (seven studies) and faster resumption of usual activities (six studies) in all studies that measured these outcomes; however, most of these data could not be pooled due to heterogeneity between the studies.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence varied, and was very low for live birth, moderate for satisfaction ratings, and moderate for most safety outcomes. The main limitations in the evidence were serious imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, failure to clearly report methods, and lack of blinding for subjective outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-12-16 14:39:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>When we compared patient satisfaction rates at up to two years following UAE versus surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy) our findings are that there is no evidence of a difference between the interventions. Findings at five year follow-up were similarly inconclusive. There was very low quality evidence to suggest that myomectomy may be associated with better fertility outcomes than UAE, but this information was only available from a selected subgroup in one small trial.</P>
<P>We found no clear evidence of a difference between UAE and surgery in the risk of major complications, but UAE was associated with a higher rate of minor complications and an increased likelihood of requiring surgical intervention within two to five years of the initial procedure. If we assume that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. This increase in the surgical re-intervention rate may balance out any initial cost advantage of UAE. Thus although UAE is a safe, minimally invasive alternative to surgery, patient selection and counselling are paramount due to the much higher risk of requiring further surgical intervention.</P>

<P>Uterine fibroids (also called myomas) are the most commonly found gynaecological benign tumours. The precise factors governing their growth and regression are unknown, but fibroids grow in response to stimulation from sex steroid hormones. They are typically discovered in the late reproductive period and are present in up to 60% of women after the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-Okolo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okolo 2008</LINK>). Spontaneous regression occurs following menopause, probably as a result of the reduction in estrogen hormone production by the ovaries.</P>
<P>Complaints associated with fibroids, particularly heavy menstrual bleeding, affect quality of life and comprise a substantial societal burden, with a significant impact on health care use and costs (<LINK REF="REF-Cardozo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardozo 2012</LINK>). In the UK, one million women annually seek help for heavy menstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) and reported treatment costs exceed £65m; an estimated 3.5 million work-days are lost annually (<LINK REF="REF-Rahn-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahn 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fibroids can cause heavy and prolonged uterine bleeding, pain, pressure symptoms and subfertility, but rarely cause damage to adjacent organs. Asymptomatic fibroids can be discovered on routine pelvic examination and verified on ultrasound. Treatment of fibroids is generally reserved for those women who experience symptoms and for women planning to become pregnant who have large fibroids or fibroids that significantly distort the uterine cavity.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-24 00:32:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Currently available medical therapies for fibroids have not demonstrated long-term efficacy. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues effectively reduce bleeding and decrease fibroid size but can only be used for a limited time because of their adverse effect on bone mass. Medical therapies for heavy menstrual bleeding, such as combined oral contraceptives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and progestogens (including the Mirena intrauterine system), appear to be less effective in the presence of uterine fibroids although few studies have addressed this issue. There is recent evidence that selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs), namely ulipristal acetate, can be used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in the short term and to reduce total fibroid volume in preparation for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-PEARL-I" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEARL I</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PEARL-II" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEARL II</LINK>). Surgical therapies for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding related to fibroids include hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, transcervical resection of submucous fibroid, laparoscopic myomectomy or myolysis, laparoscopic bipolar coagulation or dissection of uterine vessels (or both), myomectomy and hysterectomy.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for women with symptomatic fibroids to have surgical treatment, accounting for between 30% to 70% of the approximately 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the US each year (<LINK REF="REF-Broder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lepine-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepine 1997</LINK>). Other surgical procedures for fibroids are done less commonly, with approximately 35,000 abdominal or open myomectomies each year (<LINK REF="REF-NCHS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCHS 1998</LINK>). As with all surgical procedures, hysterectomy and myomectomy are associated with complications. Hysterectomy has an approximately 3% incidence of major complications (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 2004</LINK>), while the rate for myomectomy is less well defined. Myomectomy is associated with long-term problems such as fibroid recurrence, adhesion formation, and the increased possibility of uterine rupture during pregnancy and vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Gehlbach-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gehlbach 1993</LINK>). There is a high need for effective non-surgical therapies for uterine fibroids.</P>
<P>Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has established itself as a minimally invasive procedure for reducing symptoms from uterine fibroids. In the past, embolization was used to reduce pelvic pain and bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1987</LINK>). Only since 1995 has UAE been seen as a potential treatment for menorrhagia related to uterine fibroids (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravina-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravina 1997</LINK>). Promising results have been obtained with regard to symptom relief but there is concern about post-procedure pain, post-embolization syndrome, infection, premature ovarian failure (POF), secondary amenorrhoea due to endometrial atrophy or intrauterine adhesions, and the unknown effect on conception and pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Khaund-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaund 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>UAE, like myomectomy, spares the uterus and carries an obvious appeal to women with large fibroids who are either subfertile or repeatedly miscarry. There are reports of live births following fibroid embolization. Potential complications following the procedure are ovarian failure due to impairment of ovarian blood flow and infection leading to fallopian tube damage with subsequent infertility. There has been a report of uterine rupture at childbirth following UAE. There is also the theoretical risk of an adverse effect on placental blood flow following UAE. In these circumstances, there is the possibility that the incidence of pregnancy complications such as preterm labour, intrauterine growth restriction and postpartum haemorrhage could be increased, and further data are awaited. Hence, the UAE procedure is suitable for women with fibroids who have completed their families and also for those wishing to conceive who have symptomatic fibroids (for example heavy menstrual bleeding) after careful and appropriate counselling.</P>
<P>UAE involves complete occlusion of both uterine arteries with particulate emboli, with the objective of causing ischaemic necrosis of the uterine fibroids but no permanent adverse effect on the otherwise normal uterus. This has been performed using general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, and epidural or spinal anaesthesia. Some practitioners administer prophylactic antibiotics. An angiography catheter is inserted directly into the woman's femoral artery and the contralateral uterine artery is then selectively catheterized. The catheter is manoeuvred to the opposite uterine artery (ipsilateral to the femoral puncture site) and the process repeated. The most commonly used agent for occlusion is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a non-biodegradable agent available in a variety of sizes (normally 150 to 1000 microns for this procedure) which is suspended in a contrast solution. Occlusion (blockage) of the uterine vessels is confirmed by angiography (X-ray dye test) and the catheter removed. The procedure takes between 45 and 135 minutes to complete and the woman is exposed to approximately 20 rads (20 cGy) of ionising radiation to the ovaries (<LINK REF="REF-Spies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spies 1999</LINK>). Women are observed for up to 24 hours post-procedure and treated with narcotics for pain relief.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-16 11:36:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Successful UAE is meant to totally occlude both the uterine vessels. The normal myometrium (muscle of the womb) rapidly establishes a new blood supply through collateral vessels from the ovarian and vaginal circulations. However, fibroids appear to be supplied by end arteries without the collateral flow found in normal myometrium and, therefore, are preferentially affected by the occlusion. The reduction in blood supply results in a decrease in fibroid volume with resultant improvement in the woman's symptoms.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-12-13 18:06:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that UAE should be offered as a treatment choice in women presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding. NICE does not indicate a preference in subfertile women (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). However, surgical treatment is often used for symptomatic women with fibroids. This is more true for women who have subfertility due to fibroids. All of the surgical procedures are associated with risks. UAE is being suggested as an alternative but is not without its own risks. Therefore, it is important to have the best available evidence to compare different types of interventions. The current state of the evidence reported in this review highlights the high level of uncertainty within the trials indicating that further high quality trials are required.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2014-12-17 10:31:13 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Seven studies were included in the review. See the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Study design: all seven studies were RCTs.</P>
<P>Participants: all women (n = 793) in the included studies had symptomatic fibroids that justified surgical treatment. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-EMMY-2010" TYPE="STUDY">EMMY 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FUME-2012" TYPE="STUDY">FUME 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruuskanen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ruuskanen 2010</LINK>) excluded women who desired future pregnancies. The <LINK REF="STD-Jun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jun 2012</LINK> study did not specify the fertility plans of its participants even though the majority of women underwent myomectomy in the surgical arm. The <LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK> study included premenopausal women with fibroids who had unfinished reproductive plans. The size of the fibroids was a limiting factor in two studies (larger than 10 cm in <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK> and 12 cm in <LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK>). All studies except <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK> specifically excluded women with submucosal fibroids and pedunculated subserosal fibroids, as at that time both of these were thought to be a contraindication for UAE.</P>
<P>Interventions: three studies compared UAE versus hysterectomy (<LINK REF="STD-EMMY-2010" TYPE="STUDY">EMMY 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruuskanen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ruuskanen 2010</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK>) compared UAE with hysterectomy or myomectomy. In this study the type of surgery (hysterectomy or myomectomy) was the choice of the participant, depending on whether she wished to retain her uterus for fertility or other reasons: 8/51 women opted for myomectomy in the <LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK> study and 53/62 in the <LINK REF="STD-Jun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jun 2012</LINK> study. Two studies compared UAE with myomectomy (<LINK REF="STD-FUME-2012" TYPE="STUDY">FUME 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-FUME-2012" TYPE="STUDY">FUME 2012</LINK> six women in the UAE group had a hysterectomy, two had a myomectomy and one a repeat embolization; in the myomectomy group two were converted to hysterectomy and one had a hysterectomy seven months later.</P>
<P>Outcomes: the primary outcomes were patient satisfaction and live birth. Six studies reported on patient satisfaction with treatment up to 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-EMMY-2010" TYPE="STUDY">EMMY 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruuskanen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ruuskanen 2010</LINK>) and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-EMMY-2010" TYPE="STUDY">EMMY 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK>) also reported this at five years. <LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK> was the only study designed to report on live birth. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK>) reported the reproductive outcome of the small number of women who opted for myomectomy (8/51), but this was not intended as an outcome measure and has not been included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures were adverse events (intra-procedural, minor and major post-procedural complications); further interventions; unscheduled readmission rates; cost effectiveness; FSH levels post-procedure, fibroid recurrence rate, pregnancy and health-related quality of life.

<P>No blinding was possible in any of the trials as one of the treatment arms included surgery, that is hysterectomy or myomectomy. Therefore, risk of bias was high in all trials for subjective outcomes (such as satisfaction rates) and unclear for other outcomes such as complications and re-intervention. It was possible that participant blinding might affect the number of readmissions in the immediate post-operative period as often women are asked to report back with trivial symptoms if they have undergone any relatively new procedure.</P>

In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK>) intention-to-treat analysis was only used to evaluate efficiency. This trial also allowed women to change their allocated intervention. That is, three women assigned to the hysterectomy group underwent UAE and, therefore, the effectiveness and safety parameters were calculated on the actual treatment received (treatment received analysis). The risk of attrition bias was high in this study. Hence, for the review, data from the Pinto trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK>) presented by intention-to-treat analysis only have been used. Also the length of follow-up was meant to be 24 months but the published results were for six months only. We contacted the authors of this trial for the long-term data and they sent us their 12 month unpublished data, which we could not use for this review because the mean data were incomplete.</P>
<P>The risk of attrition bias in <LINK REF="STD-FUME-2012" TYPE="STUDY">FUME 2012</LINK> was high as 23% of women randomised to UAE and 27% of those randomised to myomectomy were excluded from the analysis.

<P>One of the studies comparing UAE versus myomectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK>) reported this outcome. The pregnancy rate was calculated from the limited cohort of participants who tried to conceive (26 women after UAE and 40 after myomectomy).

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-FUME-2012" TYPE="STUDY">FUME 2012</LINK>, when the overall UFS-QOL scores at one year follow-up were compared, they were significantly higher in the myomectomy group than in the UAE group (MD -13.40; 95% CI - 21.41 to -5.39, 122 women). However, the study authors noted that scores were (non-significantly) lower at baseline in the UAE group. When mean changes in score from baseline were compared there was little clinically meaningful difference between the two groups (MD -7.60; 95% CI -17.55 to -2.35, 122 women). There was an improvement from baseline in overall quality of life in both groups.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK>) reported SF-36 quality of life (QoL) outcome measures at 6 and 12 months, respectively, on an 11 point score. Surgery was associated with a greater improvement in QoL at 1 year than UAE (MD 9.14; 95% CI 8.04 to 10.23, 281 women). This was of borderline clinical significance (the difference in QoL score seemed to be similar in both cases (7% versus 9%)).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-16 14:47:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>This Cochrane review summarises the current evidence on the effectiveness of UAE compared to surgery (hysterectomy or myomectomy) as a treatment option for symptomatic uterine fibroids. The evidence on satisfaction rates was inconclusive in spite of a higher rate of post-procedural complications and further re-interventions in the UAE arm of the studies. Our findings showed evidence of benefit or harm from either intervention, or of no difference between the interventions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2008</LINK> was the only study which specifically looked at the impact of UAE versus myomectomy on fertility, an important parameter as both are uterine-sparing procedures. The findings for live birth suggested a possible benefit from myomectomy. However, as noted above, this finding should be regarded with extreme caution as it was based on a subgroup analysis of those stating a desire to conceive, and the confidence intervals were evidence of no meaningful difference between the interventions.</P>
<P>UAE was advantageous over hysterectomy or myomectomy with regard to a shorter hospital stay, a quicker return to full activity, and reduced likelihood of a need for blood transfusion. However, UAE was associated with an increased short-term (within one year) and up to five year risk of minor complications. Findings with regard to major complications were inconclusive.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review, the authors concluded that the women opting for UAE should be counselled about a higher surgical intervention rate in the longer term. This is supported by the five year follow-up data from the EMMY and REST trials. There is a five-fold increase in the likelihood of needing further intervention after UAE. Although UAE initially appears to be a cost effective alternative to hysterectomy, the long-term follow-up at five years shows that this advantage is lost due to a subsequent higher rate of re-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-EMMY-2010" TYPE="STUDY">EMMY 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">REST 2011</LINK>). Surgery was also associated with a slight improvement in quality of life compared to UAE but this might not be clinically meaningful.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-12-13 20:21:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane review was performed according to the current standards of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. Applicability and completeness of this review reflect the study characteristics and completeness by which they were reported. Even though the primary outcome measures differed for different trials, they collected similar outcome data, which made this review possible. Given that UAE is a uterine-sparing procedure, there was only one trial comparing it with another uterine-sparing procedure (myomectomy) that reported on fertility and pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>Current findings apply to women similar to the populations of the included studies: premenopausal women with menorrhagia caused by uterine fibroids, confirmed either by ultrasonography or MRI, and fit to undergo surgical treatment. Review findings apply to the time frame of six months to five years after the intervention.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-12-13 20:18:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence had a wide range and was very low for live birth, moderate for satisfaction ratings, and moderate for most safety outcomes. The main limitations in the evidence were serious imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, failure to clearly report methods, and lack of blinding for subjective outcomes. There was only one trial subgroup which examined fertility outcomes, and this limits the possibility of drawing any conclusions regarding the effects of UAE on fertility and pregnancy. Overall, the imprecision of the findings meant that few firm conclusions could be drawn.</P>
<P>A detection bias may be present for subjective outcomes as blinding was not performed. Participant blinding may not be feasible due to ethical issues, and blinding of the physician is not practical. It is possible that participant blinding might have affected the number of readmissions in the immediate post-operative period as often women are asked to report back with trivial symptoms if they have undergone any relatively new procedure. The most important consideration was study power. The RCTs were all limited by relatively small samples. Power issues underline the importance of meta-analysis.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-07-02 13:39:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strength of this review lies in the application of Cochrane methodology. An extensive literature search was applied, therefore we believe that the likelihood is quite high that all relevant studies were identified.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-13 20:15:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review are in keeping with the results of the systematic review commissioned by NICE (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2004</LINK>). This review was based on one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2003</LINK>), two comparative studies, one patient questionnaire survey, and 32 papers from 25 case series. The review concluded that there was a reduction in mean uterine volume of 26% to 59% and fibroid volume of 40% to 75% in the first six months following UAE. In studies with longer follow-up, this was shown to continue in most women. The review quoted the clinical success rate, that is improvement of symptoms, mainly menorrhagia, to be in the range of 60% to 90%.</P>
<P>The findings are further supported by another large cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-HOPEFUL-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOPEFUL 2007</LINK>). This was a multi-centre retrospective study comparing the experiences of two representative cohorts of women who received one of two alternative treatments for symptomatic fibroids from the mid-1990s (hysterectomy, N = 459; UAE, N = 649). More women in the hysterectomy cohort reported relief from fibroid symptoms (95% versus 85%, P &lt; 0.0001) but only 85% would recommend the treatment to a friend compared with 91% in the UAE arm. There was a 23% (95% CI 19% to 27%) chance of requiring further treatment for fibroids after UAE at a mean follow-up of 4.6 years, which is similar to the findings of the current review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-12-16 14:44:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-12-16 14:44:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>When we compared patient satisfaction rates at up to two years following UAE versus surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy), our findings were evidence of substantial benefit or harm from either intervention, or of no difference between them. Findings at five year follow-up were similarly inconclusive. There was very low quality evidence to suggest that myomectomy may be associated with better fertility outcomes than UAE, but this information was only available from a selected subgroup in one small trial and should be regarded with extreme caution.</P>
<P>We found no clear indication of a difference between UAE and surgery in the risk of major complications, but UAE was associated with a higher rate of minor complications and an increased likelihood of requiring surgical intervention within two to five years of the initial procedure. If we assume that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. This increase in the surgical re-intervention rate may balance out any initial cost advantage of UAE. Thus although UAE is a safe, minimally invasive alternative to surgery, patient selection and counselling is paramount due to the much higher risk of requiring further surgical intervention.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-12-13 19:35:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we have some long term follow-up studies comparing UAE with hysterectomy, there is a continued need for further larger randomised controlled trials assessing fertility outcomes of UAE in women with symptomatic fibroids, that is by comparing UAE with myomectomy. The FEMME study (UK) is currently ongoing and we await the results.</P>

<P>Study: EMMY Trial. Design: randomized controlled trial.

<P>Participants: women were enrolled from five university hospitals and 29 general hospitals. Of 349 eligible participants, 177 were randomised: 88 were allocated UAE and 89 hysterectomy. The majority of participants refusing participation did so for a strong preference for hysterectomy (58%) or for UAE (21%). After randomisation, seven women in the UAE group and 14 women in the hysterectomy group refused the allocated treatment. The mean age was 44.6 years (UAE group) and 45.4 years (hysterectomy group). Participants suffered from menorrhagia for a median of 24 months. The majority of women had multiple fibroids. Fibroid volumes were higher in the hysterectomy group. Logistic regression analysis did not reveal baseline characteristics that could predict randomisation outcome, confirming successful randomisation<BR/>Country: the Netherlands<BR/>Inclusion criteria: 1) the clinical diagnosis of uterine fibroids confirmed by ultrasonography; 2) menorrhagia (subjectively reported by the patient as increased or prolonged menstrual blood loss which caused dysfunction in daily life) was their predominant complaint, among other possibly fibroid-related signs and symptoms; 3) they were premenopausal; and 4) they were to be scheduled for a hysterectomy<BR/>Exclusion criteria: 1) preservation of the uterus was warranted for future pregnancy; 2) renal failure (creatinine &gt;150 mmol/L), active pelvic infection, or clotting disorders were clinically established; 3) they were allergic to contrast material; 4) uterine malignancy was suspected; 5) submucosal fibroids with 50% of their diameter within the uterine cavity or dominant pedunculated serosal fibroids were present</P>

The remaining 11.1% consisted of 5 women (6.2%) with a unilateral procedure (caused by technical failure on the other side) and 4 women (4.9%) with bilateral UAE failure<BR/>Control group: After randomisation, 14 (14.6%) women declined hysterectomy with 75 (85.4%) undergoing hysterectomy with 84% through an abdominal route<BR/>Duration of trial: Recruitment took place between March 2002 and February 2004 with follow-up of 5 years reported</P>

In tortuous, small or spastic uterine arteries, catheterization was performed with a 2.1- French microcatheter to ensure free-flow embolization. An Angio-Seal closure device was routinely used. The same interventional radiologist performed all interventions (HM, with 2 years&#8217; experience in UAE at the beginning of the trial).

Terminology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needs some attention to copy editing, grammatical editing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the review, there is a scattering of inappropriate tenses for example in Risk of bias section, secondary outcomes, data synthesis etc. you use the future tense &amp;#8220;will&amp;#8221;. However, all these things are supposed to have been completed. You shouldn't be using the future tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to pay attention to tense used in abstract in results section some results are in present tense and some in past tense. Also in results subheading, I would put in brackets how you define &amp;#8220;long term&amp;#8221; it is in the conclusion but each subheading should stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the main results section please structure according to the two comparisons and then the primary outcomes.&amp;#160; For example the sentence &amp;#8220;the mean dominant fibroid volume decreased by 51%&amp;#8221;. This is a secondary outcome and the sentence does say which comparison it refers to. Can you please add the ORs and 95% CI to this section. The 5 year data seems to be very important and yet it is not in the authors conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.Plain Language summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall it is too detailed.

The principles for outcomes is that they should be patient centered and that there should not be too many of them 5-10 is ideal. You have more than 20 across the data graphs and many of them are not in the protocol. I have said it later on but just because an outcome is in a paper it doesn't not mean it should be in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the background the word myomata is used.
