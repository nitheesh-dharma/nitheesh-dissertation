<P>The effect of giving intravenous fluid to prevent low blood pressure, following regional analgesia for women in labour, is unclear.</P>
<P>Regional (epidural, spinal or combined spinal-epidural) analgesia is a common form of pain relief used during labour. Some women have hypotension (low blood pressure) following regional analgesia which can affect both mother and baby. Intravenous fluids before epidural analgesia with high-dose local anaesthetics reduces hypotension. This benefit is not seen when the more recent low-dose local anaesthetics are used, probably due to a lower risk of hypotension with these drugs. There was not enough evidence to show whether preloading is beneficial for women having regional analgesia during labour using the lower-dose agents, or for women with pregnancy complications.<BR/>

<P>Six studies are included (473 participants). In one epidural trial using high-dose local anaesthetic, preloading with intravenous fluids was shown to counteract the hypotension which frequently follows traditional epidural analgesia (relative risk (RR) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.53; 102 women). This trial was also associated with a reduction in fetal heart rate abnormalities (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; 102 women); no differences were detected in other perinatal and maternal outcomes for this trial and another high-dose epidural trial. In the two epidural low-dose anaesthetic trials, no significant difference in maternal hypotension was found (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.48; 260 women), although they were underpowered to detect less than a very large effect. No significant differences were seen between groups in these trials for fetal heart rate abnormalities (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.05; 233 women).<BR/>
<BR/>In the two CSE trials, no differences were reported between preloading and no preloading groups.

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-02 14:51:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Regional analgesia is commonly used for pain relief during labour. A fine catheter may be inserted into the space outside the membrane surrounding the cerebro-spinal fluid ('epidural'), or a needle inserted into the cerebro-spinal fluid ('spinal'), or both may be combined ('combined spinal-epidural'). Local anaesthetic (such as bupivacaine) and/or opioid drugs (such as fentanyl) are injected to block pain sensation. Side-effects include a loss of muscle power and blockade of the sympathetic nervous system causing dilatation of blood vessels (vasodilatation). This may in turn cause a fall in blood pressure. Intravenous fluid preloading (volume expansion by infusing fluid intravenously) prior to regional analgesia during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Ramanathan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanathan 1983</LINK>) is widely practised. The rationale is to prevent the occurrence of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989</LINK>) which is thought to result at least in part from relative hypovolaemia due to vasodilation following sympathetic blockade. Fetal heart rate changes are commonly observed following regional analgesia during labour, although the clinical significance of these changes is not entirely clear. They are thought to be at least in part caused by reduced uterine blood flow due to maternal hypotension, though fetal bradycardia (slowing of the fetal heart rate) following induction of epidural analgesia without overt systemic hypotension has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Stavrou-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stavrou 1989</LINK>). Newer techniques using low concentrations of local anaesthetic solution may reduce the need for preloading (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsella 2000</LINK>). Intrathecal opioid injection has little effect on sympathetic activity and would therefore not be expected to cause hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 1996</LINK>), though hypotension has been found in practice (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Angelo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Angelo 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rapid fluid infusion may potentially cause side-effects such as fluid overload and, in susceptible women, pulmonary oedema. Three deaths due to pre-eclampsia or eclampsia have been associated with iatrogenic fluid overload in a report on maternal death (<LINK REF="REF-UK-Dept-Health-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Dept Health 1998</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess, from the best available evidence, the effects on maternal and fetal well-being of intravenous fluid preloading before regional analgesia in labour.</P>

<BR/>We considered all studies identified by the search strategy outlined above for inclusion. We evaluated trials included for appropriateness and methodological quality without consideration of their results. Two reviewers independently assessed the trials for inclusion. We resolved any differences of opinion by discussion. We recorded and reported reasons for excluding trials.</P>
<P>We assigned quality scores for allocation concealment to each trial, using the criteria described in Section six of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>):<BR/>A = adequate; B = unclear; C = clearly inadequate.</P>

<P>We also assessed studies for blinding but, due to the nature of the interventions, we planned to include studies that were not blinded.</P>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted the data. Whenever necessary, we sought unpublished data from investigators. We performed statistical analyses using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2004</LINK>). We processed included trial data as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>We compared categorical data using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals using a fixed effect model. We tested statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I² statistic, regarding I² greater than 50% as statistically significant heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Subsequent to the original protocol being written, low-dose local anaesthetic and opioid only analgesia became common practice. We therefore amended the original protocol to include a subgroup analysis of epidural high-dose local anaesthetic, epidural low-dose local anaesthetic, combined spinal-epidural or opioid only (epidural or intrathecal) analgesia.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hypotension</HEADING>
<P>Since there is no commonly accepted definition for hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Emmett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmett 2004</LINK>), we used each study author's definition of the hypotension measure that required intervention. This was defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of over 20 mm Hg in <LINK REF="STD-Collins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1978</LINK>; a fall greater than 20% in systolic blood pressure from baseline in <LINK REF="STD-Macaulay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Macaulay 2000</LINK>; and a fall greater than 20% in mean arterial pressure from baseline (within 30 minutes of the epidural) in <LINK REF="STD-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsella 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shannon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shannon 1998</LINK>.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Collins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1978</LINK>, allocation of the participants was quasi-random (coded C), as case note numbers were used. <LINK REF="STD-Cheek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cheek 1996</LINK> described allocation as random and prospective; in <LINK REF="STD-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsella 2000</LINK>, allocation was "determined on the basis of a computer-generated list"; <LINK REF="STD-Macaulay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Macaulay 2000</LINK> stated that women were "randomly allocated"; <LINK REF="STD-Shannon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shannon 1998</LINK> also made assignments according to a computer-generated random number table; and so these four studies were coded B (unclear) for allocation concealment. <LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2003</LINK> used sealed envelopes and so this was study was also coded B.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Losses to follow up</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cheek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cheek 1996</LINK>, two women were excluded from the no preload group and one women was excluded from each of the two preload groups because of rapid progression of labour. In <LINK REF="STD-Collins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1978</LINK>, two women (both from the preload group) were excluded from analysis; no reasons were stated.In <LINK REF="STD-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsella 2000</LINK>, one woman from each group was excluded; one had a placental abruption and caesarean section, and the other gave birth vaginally. One women in the preload group and two in the no preload group were excluded after study completion, as they were found to have had abnormal baseline fetal heart rate patterns before the epidural. Fetal heart rate readings were only available for 81 women.<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2003</LINK>, two women from the preload group and one from the no preload group were found to be in the second stage of labour before the study could be completed, and so these three women were excluded from further analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Macaulay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Macaulay 2000</LINK>, there were no losses to follow up for the outcome of hypotension, but only 32 out of 40 babies had fetal heart traces available.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intention to treat</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cheek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cheek 1996</LINK>, 34 women were randomised and analysis was performed on 30 (11 in the no preload group, eight in the 500 ml preload group and 11 in the 1000 ml preload group). In <LINK REF="STD-Collins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1978</LINK>, 104 women were randomised and analysis was performed on 102 (49 in the preload group and 53 in the no preload group). In <LINK REF="STD-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsella 2000</LINK>, 100 women were randomised and analysis was performed on 95 (49 in the preload group and 46 in the no preload group). In <LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2003</LINK>, two women in the no preload group were treated with intravenous fluid and one woman in the preload group was given additional fluid. Results for these 165 women were analysed by intention to treat. In <LINK REF="STD-Macaulay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Macaulay 2000</LINK>, fetal heart abnormality was not analysed on an intention to treat basis.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although there are methodological shortcomings in the trials reviewed, the effects of fluid preloading, on reducing maternal hypotension and fetal heart rate abnormalities when high-dose local anaesthetics are used as part of a regional technique, appear clear-cut, with a 26% reduction in hypotension (from 28% of women with hypotension without preloading reduced to 2% with preloading in <LINK REF="STD-Collins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1978</LINK>). While it is unlikely that such large differences are entirely due to bias or chance, <LINK REF="REF-Plaat-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plaat 2001</LINK> notes that the supine position used in the Collins high-dose epidural study (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1978</LINK>) may have influenced the incidence of hypotension. </P>
<P>The use of high-dose local anaesthetic is no longer usual practice, but unfortunately the data on the use of low-dose local anaesthetics or opioids during epidural or combined spinal-epidural are insufficient for meaningful analysis. No statistically significant differences between preloading and no preloading were seen for hypotension and fetal heart rate abnormalities but the wide confidence intervals do not refute (or confirm) a difference. If there is indeed an effect from preloading before low-dose local anaesthetics, it would probably not be as pronounced as when high-dose local anaesthetics are used. <LINK REF="REF-Popham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popham 2001</LINK> notes that the need to prevent maternal hypotension no longer applies for the majority of women who receive low-dose local anaesthetic as part of their regional analgesia, although the situation for fetal heart rate abnormalities is not as clear. The two low-dose epidural trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsella 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kubli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubli 2003</LINK>) which found a statistically nonsignificant trend to less fetal heart rate abnormalities with preloading, are likely to be underpowered.</P>
<P>No studies reported maternal outcomes such as lightheadedness, fainting, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms may reflect an otherwise undetected fall in blood pressure and should be recorded in future studies of preloading.</P>
<P>The possibility of uncommon adverse effects of the fluid preload cannot be excluded on the basis of these studies.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-30 12:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although intravenous preloading before traditional high-dose epidural anaesthesia shows value in reducing hypotension and fetal heart rate abnormalities, benefits have not been demonstrated when the more common low-dose epidural anaesthetics have been used. Low-dose epidural and combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anaesthetics may reduce the need for preloading. However, the small evidence base does not allow a difference between preloading and no preloading to be ruled out or confirmed, when low-dose epidural or CSE anaesthetics are used.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-30 12:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of preloading for low-dose epidural and CSE (including opioid only) blocks in labour, relative risks and benefits of preloading prior to epidural anaesthesia in the presence of pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and cardiac disease, the optimal type and volume of fluid, maternal outcomes such as lightheadedness, fainting, nausea and vomiting, potential side-effects, and women's views require further investigation.</P>
