<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of using inhaled dornase alfa for treating lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which affects the movement of salt across cells in the body and affects, for example, the sweat glands, airways, pancreas and male reproductive system. Lung disease is the most common cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis and although the average life expectancy has increased over the last 30 years, it is still only 48.5 years in developed countries. People with cystic fibrosis develop chronic lung disease because of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs which causes infections and inflammation. Dornase alfa was developed to thin out this mucus, so it is easier for people to cough it up from their lungs; this in turn should decrease the number of infections and amount of inflammation and prevent chronic lung disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 28 November 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 19 trials in the review with a total of 2565 people with cystic fibrosis. Fifteen trials compared dornase alfa to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication) or no dornase alfa treatment (2447 people); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 people); one compared daily dornase alfa with hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 people); and one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 people). People from all age groups (infants through to adults) took part in the trials which lasted from six days to three years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found evidence that dornase alfa improves lung function within one month when compared to a placebo or no treatment and this improvement was also seen in longer trials lasting from six months to two years; there were also fewer flare ups of the condition in these longer trials. One trial found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs.</P>
<P>The results from trials comparing dornase alfa to hypertonic saline or mannitol were mixed. One trial showed a greater improvement in lung function with dornase alfa compared to hypertonic saline, and three trials found no difference between medications. In the only trial to assess the combination of dornase alfa with another medication compared to dornase alfa alone, there was no benefit seen with the combination of dornase alfa and mannitol.</P>
<P>Overall, no serious side effects were reported, with only rash and a change in voice seen more frequently in those people taking dornase alfa. However, it is not definitively clear from the current evidence if dornase alfa is better than other medications such as hypertonic saline or mannitol.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence from the trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo or no treatment was moderate to high for lung function results, but only one trial reported any changes in quality of life so the evidence for this outcome is limited.</P>
<P>Also, there were few trials comparing different treatment schedules of dornase alfa (e.g. once a day versus twice a day) or comparing dornase alfa to other medications which help with clearing secretions, so current evidence from these trials is limited and of low quality.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:35:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-10 13:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Dornase alfa is currently used as a mucolytic to treat pulmonary disease (the major cause of morbidity and mortality) in cystic fibrosis. It reduces mucus viscosity in the lungs, promoting improved clearance of secretions. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-07-16 05:56:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Connie Yang">
<P>To determine whether the use of dornase alfa in cystic fibrosis is associated with improved mortality and morbidity compared to placebo or other medications that improve airway clearance, and to identify any adverse events associated with its use.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-11-30 10:55:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Register: 30 November 2015.</P>
<P>Clinicaltrials.gov was also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: 28 November 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-08-04 13:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy or other medications that improve airway clearance.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-03-10 13:38:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Authors independently assessed trials against the inclusion criteria; two authors carried out analysis of methodological quality and data extraction.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:35:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The searches identified 54 trials, of which 19 (including a total of 2565 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Three additional papers examined the healthcare cost from one of the clinical trials. Fifteen trials compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa treatment (2447 participants); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 participants); one compared daily dornase alfa with hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 participants); one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 participants). Trial duration varied from six days to three years.</P>
<P>Compared to placebo, forced expiratory volume at one second improved in the intervention groups, with significant differences at one, three, six months and two years. There was also a significant improvement in lung clearance index at one month. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations compared to placebo in trials of longer duration. The quality of the evidence from placebo-controlled trials was moderate to high for outcomes of lung function and pulmonary exacerbations. Limited, low quality evidence was available for changes in quality of life from baseline. One trial that examined the cost of care, including the cost of dornase alfa, found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs.</P>
<P>The results for trials comparing dornase alfa to other medications that improve airway clearance (hypertonic saline or mannitol) were mixed, with one trial showing a greater improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second for dornase alfa compared to hypertonic saline, and three trials finding no difference between medications. In the only trial to assess the combination of dornase alfa with another medication compared to dornase alone, there was no benefit seen with the combination of dornase alfa and mannitol. Evidence of dornase alfa compared to other medications was limited and the open-label design of the trials may have induced bias, therefore the quality of the evidence was judged to be low.</P>
<P>Dornase alfa did not cause significantly more adverse effects, except voice alteration and rash.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-10 13:42:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There is evidence to show that, compared with placebo, therapy with dornase alfa improves lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in trials lasting one month to two years. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations in trials of six months or longer. Voice alteration and rash appear to be the only adverse events reported with increased frequency in randomised controlled trials. There is not enough evidence to firmly conclude if dornase alfa is superior to hyperosmolar agents in improving lung function.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:35:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-10 14:02:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder amongst Caucasians, affecting about one in every 2300 births. Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Flume-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flume 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with CF inherit an abnormality in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein leading to an abnormal movement of chloride and sodium across the airway epithelium. The reduced secretion of chloride into and the excessive absorption of sodium from the airway surface liquid results in a diminished airway surface liquid layer. Consequently, there is decreased mucociliary and cough clearance of airway secretions. The retained airway secretions allow development of a chronic endobronchial infection and induce an exuberant neutrophilic inflammatory response. The large influx of neutrophils into the airways release proteolytic enzymes and oxidants. When the neutrophils die, large quantities of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are released causing the sputum to be thick and tenacious. The thick secretions lead to mucus plugging of the airways and further cycles of infection and inflammation. There is evidence that the initiation of significant airway damage occurs early with findings of pathogenic bacteria, airway inflammation and imaging changes in infants diagnosed by newborn screening (<LINK REF="REF-Sly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sly 2009</LINK>). The unremitting endobronchial infection and neutrophilic inflammation gradually result in irreversible bronchiectasis and eventual respiratory failure.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:35:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®) is a highly purified solution of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase); it reduces mucus viscosity in the lungs, promoting improved clearance of secretions. The recommended dose for use in most people with CF is 2.5 mg (in one single-use ampoule) inhaled once daily using a recommended nebuliser. Dornase alfa is used in conjunction with other standard CF therapies.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-05 11:24:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In the 1950s it was shown that the enzyme; bovine deoxyribonuclease (DNase) reduced the viscosity of sputum taken from people with CF by digesting the airway extracellular DNA released from neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1968</LINK>). However, clinical trials of bovine DNase had to be stopped due to adverse effects. In 1990 dornase alfa was produced and since 1992 it has been used as a mucolytic to treat people with CF. In contrast, medications such as hypertonic saline and mannitol are osmotically active and are felt to improve mucociliary clearance by rehydrating the airway surface liquid.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:35:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In 2015, the average cost of dornase alfa per person, per year was CDN 14,300, while the cost of hypertonic saline (Nebusal&#8482; 4 ml 7%) was CDN 880 (<LINK REF="REF-Cho-E-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cho E [pers comm]</LINK>) and mannitol was CDN 11,374 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). In addition, the treatment burden of people with CF is increasingly being recognized with the average time spent on therapies being 108 minutes per day, with the use of two or more nebulised medications significantly adding to this burden (<LINK REF="REF-Sawicki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawicki 2009</LINK>). It is important to understand the clinical benefits of medications in order to weigh the monetary and time costs of these therapies.</P>
<P>This is an update of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kearney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Relevant trials were identified from the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register using the term: dornase alfa.</P>
<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), weekly searches of MEDLINE, a search of Embase to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals - <I>Pediatric Pulmonology </I>and the <I>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</I>. Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of three major cystic fibrosis conferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference; the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant sections of the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/CF/frame.html">Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Module</A>.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's register: 30 November 2015.</P>
<P>The trials database <A HREF="http://Clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</A> was also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials using the terms dornase alfa and cystic fibrosis. Date of most recent search: 28 November 2015.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-08-05 11:30:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>From the 2015 update, the lead author (CY) and a colleague (MC or MM) independently selected the trials to be included in the review. There were no disagreements about the selection of included trials, but if there are any such disagreements in the future, we will reach a consensus by discussion.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-03-10 14:08:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The lead author and a colleague (MC or MM) independently extracted data on lung function (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC, LCI, FEV<SUB>0.5</SUB>), QoL, exacerbations, deaths, days of oral and IV antibiotics, number of days in hospital, change in weight, adverse events and cost. There were no disagreements about the extracted data, but if there are any such disagreements in the future, we will reach a consensus by discussion.</P>
<P>In previous versions of this review, all trials that reported data at time points of one month or less were combined in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kearney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 1998</LINK>). It has since been decided that due to the fact that the trial by Wilmott was conducted over two weeks during an acute exacerbation (in contrast to the other trials which recruited participants with stable disease), it would be more appropriate to exclude the trial from this analysis and to analyse it separately (<LINK REF="STD-Wilmott-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilmott 1996</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-14 13:53:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The lead author (CY) and a colleague (MM, MC) assessed the risk of bias in the included trials using the Cochrane tool for this as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-08-18 16:59:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Connie Yang">
<P>For dichotomous data we used the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as a measure of treatment effect, where appropriate. For continuous outcomes, we recorded mean change from baseline for each group and standard deviation (SD) for each group. We calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs or the generic inverse variance as appropriate. </P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-09-14 14:03:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Where trials measured data longitudinally, we based the analysis on the final time point results. Jones discusses methods for the analysis of aggregate longitudinal data (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2009</LINK>); however, the information that is required to conduct these type of analyses is not available for the trials in this review. We analysed trials with a cross-over design according to the methodology recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). We analysed the lung function data from the Amin trial using the generic inverse variance (GIV) and analysed the dichotomous outcomes as if it were a parallel trial (which is a conservative method) (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>). We were able to analyse the data from the Suri trial using GIV (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>), but were only able to analyse the data from the Castile trial and the Minasian trial as if they were parallel trials (conservative method) (<LINK REF="STD-Castile-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Castile 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Minasian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Minasian 2010</LINK>). We were only able to report the data from the remaining cross-over trials in narrative form (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-03-10 14:10:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The authors requested individual patient data from all trials that are contained within this review. Genentech have not yet agreed to provide data on the trials that they funded, but we remain hopeful that this position may change (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laube-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laube 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ranasinha-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ranasinha 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilmott-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilmott 1996</LINK>). We are grateful to Mrs Mary Dodd, Dr Fabíola Adde, Dr. Reshma Amin and Pharmaxis for providing individual patient data (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minasian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Minasian 2010</LINK>). We have included data from three of these trials in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minasian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Minasian 2010</LINK>); however, we were not able to de-code the raw data from the Dodd trial and therefore have not included these data (<LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-14 05:58:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Connie Yang">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Although the interpretation of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on the magnitude and direction of the effect as well as the strength of evidence for heterogeneity, we used the following thresholds to assess I<SUP>2</SUP>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>0% to 40%: likely not important;</LI>
<LI>30% to 60%: moderate heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>50% to 90%: substantial heterogeneity;</LI>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:36:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Due to the chronic nature of the disease, in many CF trials investigators collect data longitudinally at different time points throughout the course of the trial. In all the included trials, we examined when data were collected during the trial and also which data were reported in the trial publication. For outcomes that included data from more than 10 trials, we planned to create a funnel plot to assess for publication bias.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:36:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>When we judged heterogeneity to likely be not important, we performed a fixed-effect analysis. If heterogeneity between trials was more than moderate (i.e. more than 50% to 60%), we performed a random-effects analysis.</P>
<P>In previous versions of this review, authors combined all trials which reported data at time points of one month or less in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kearney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 1998</LINK>). We have since decided that due to the fact that the trial by Wilmott was conducted over two weeks during an acute exacerbation (in contrast to the other trials which recruited participants with stable disease), it would be more appropriate to exclude the trial from this analysis and to analyse it separately (<LINK REF="STD-Wilmott-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilmott 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Primary outcomes of changes in lung function from baseline, change in QoL from baseline and number of pulmonary exacerbations are presented in the summary of findings tables at three or six months (or both) (or the nearest reported time point). For clarity in the tables, we chose to report relative changes in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>and FVC as important lung function outcomes.</P>
<P>We determined the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach; and downgraded evidence in the presence of a high risk of bias in at least one trial, indirectness of the evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results, high probability of publication bias. We downgraded evidence by one level if for a serious limitation and by two levels if very serious.</P>

In the 2000 trial by Robinson, 15 participants were randomised, but data were only included for 13 participants (no intention-to-treat analysis). Two participants withdrew due to pulmonary exacerbations (an <I>a priori</I> protocol violation), one of these was from the placebo group and the other from the dornase alfa group, given that the withdrawals were balanced between treatment groups, there is a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>). In the trials by Shah and McCoy, the risk of bias was considered low since there were few missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>). An intention-to-treat analysis was not possible in the Shah trial where five (out of 70) participants did not complete the 14-day trial period: one received a heart-lung transplant; two withdrew consent; and two from the dornase alfa group died. Changes in lung function could therefore not be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; however, adverse events and deaths were analysed on this basis (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1995a</LINK>). In the McCoy trial, two participants from the dornase alfa group did not have lung function recorded (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, three participants inadvertently received dornase alfa instead of placebo; the lung function data for these participants were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.

<P>Due to the chronic nature of the disease, in many CF trials data are collected longitudinally at different time points throughout the course of the trial. For all the trials we included in this review, we examined when data were collected during the trial and also which data were reported in the trial publication(s). Nine trials reported all time points as well as all outcomes identified in the protocol and we judged these to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frederiksen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frederiksen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laube-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laube 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ranasinha-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ranasinha 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1995a</LINK>).

<P>Four trials in this group were cross-over in design with varying washout periods ranging from no washout to four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castile-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Castile 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>). Data from the Ranasinha trial provides information on the duration of treatment effect with dornase alfa used twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Ranasinha-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ranasinha 1993</LINK>). Participants in that trial were followed weekly after treatment was discontinued and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC returned to baseline measures 11 to 18 days and 4 to 11 days after treatment discontinuation, respectively. Therefore a washout period of between two and three weeks should be adequate for trials of dornase alfa and we judged two trials to have a low risk of bias despite the cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>). Of the two trials with washout periods less than this, one did not provide any data for this review, so we judged this trial to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Dodd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dodd 2000</LINK>); and the second did not show a difference between the placebo and dornase alfa group (<LINK REF="STD-Castile-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Castile 2009</LINK>).

There was substantial heterogeneity between the trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 69%), therefore a random-effects model was used.</P>
<P>We originally planned to undertake subgroup analyses based on age of participants, disease severity and dose frequency (once-daily versus twice-daily dosing). A subgroup analysis with paediatric versus adult participants was not possible because there were no trials including only children. We were able to perform a subgroup analysis on disease severity with three trials including participants with moderate disease (dornase alfa n = 90, control n = 93) (<LINK REF="STD-Laube-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laube 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ranasinha-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ranasinha 1993</LINK>) and one trial including participants with severe disease (dornase alfa n = 31, control n = 34) (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1995a</LINK>). Similar to the findings for FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, those with moderate disease showed significant improvements in FVC, MD 10.98 (95% CI 7.68 to 14.29), whereas those with severe disease did not, MD -4.90 (95% CI -15.15 to 5.35). In addition, the heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis decreased to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0% suggesting that disease severity accounted for some of the heterogeneity in the original analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). A subgroup analysis based on frequency of drug administration was not possible because all four trials administered dornase alfa twice daily.</P>
<P>Amin reported the absolute difference in FVC, but analysis of the data showed no difference between treatment groups, MD -3.61% (95% CI -10.02 to 2.80) (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).

However, the published paper reports a significant difference in LCI between the groups (P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>). This is likely due to the fact the investigators used a model that took participants' baseline lung function into account when analysing the data which we are not able to do when analysing data in RevMan.

<P>Wilmott and Amin reported that the QoL scores they obtained showed no significant difference between the groups, in terms of improvement in cough and congestion, activity limitation, emotional well-being, fatigue, days of restriction to bed and general health perception (<LINK REF="STD-Wilmott-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilmott 1996</LINK>) or in either version of the CFQ-R (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). Fuchs used a five-point well-being score and also evaluated a CF symptom score and dyspnoea scale. There was a significant improvement in the well-being score and dyspnoea score compared to placebo in the once-daily dornase alfa group but not in the twice-daily dornase alfa group; both groups reported an improvement in the CF symptom score (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Mean number of respiratory exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Trials included participants with stable lung disease. None of the included trials reported respiratory exacerbations expressed as a mean number per period of follow up. However, three trials reported either the RR or the number of people experiencing respiratory exacerbations, therefore these data have been included within the review (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>). Additionally, one trial reported an age-adjusted RR of having more than one respiratory exacerbation, but these data were not included in the pooled analysis (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definition of a respiratory (pulmonary) exacerbation varied in the trials. Fuchs defined an exacerbation as the need for parenteral antibiotics because of any four of the following 12 signs or symptoms: change in sputum; new or increased haemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnoea; malaise, fatigue or lethargy; temperature above 38°C; anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical exam of the chest; decrease in pulmonary function by 10% or more from a previously recorded value; or radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>). Quan defined an exacerbation as respiratory symptoms requiring IV antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>). The remaining two trials did not include a specific definition for pulmonary exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>). The Amin trial planned to withdraw participants who had a pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and one participant was withdrawn for this reason, but it was not reported which treatment group this participant was from (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We included data for this outcome from trials lasting one month (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>), six months (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>) and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>) (dornase alfa n = 575, control n = 576). This yielded a RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.96) in favour of dornase alfa (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). In the trial by Fuchs, it was noted that participants aged 17 to 23 years had a higher incidence of exacerbations regardless of treatment group, and the once-daily group had a higher percentage of participants in this age range; therefore, they calculated an age-adjusted RR for the once-daily group at 0.72 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) and for the twice-daily group at 0.63 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.87) (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three papers examined the cost of health care for participants involved in the Fuchs trial, which lasted for 20 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The report by Oster prospectively documented how participants used health care and then, using secondary data sources, estimated the cost of hospitalisation and outpatient antibiotic treatment for participants in the trial. This information was then used to compare the cost of all respiratory tract infection-related health care (including non-protocol defined respiratory tract infections) between the two treatment groups and the control group. The authors estimated that the mean total cost of respiratory tract infection-related care was USD 6443, USD 4761 and USD 5628 for the placebo, once-daily and twice-daily dosage regimens respectively. This cost included all outpatient antibiotic therapy, as well as estimates of cost for any inpatient care. The estimates did not include the cost of dornase alfa itself, as this was not marketed at the time of the trial. Once dornase alfa was marketed, at a cost of USD 27 per ampoule, they were able to estimate that the reduced cost of respiratory tract infection-related care would offset between 18.3% and 37.5% of the cost of therapy itself (<LINK REF="REF-Oster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oster 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The report by von der Schulenburg used the same data from the Fuchs trial, but used health insurance costs to estimate what would have been the costs of healthcare treatment in German CF centres for participants receiving once daily dornase alfa versus those participants receiving placebo (<LINK REF="REF-von-der-Schulenburg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">von der Schulenburg 1995</LINK>). The total cost for the health care of participants, if they had been treated in a German CF centre, was DM 5879 (USD 3551) for the group receiving once-daily dornase alfa versus DM 7849 (USD 4742) for the placebo group. This included the cost of inpatient admissions, outpatient appointments and investigations. The cost of all antibiotics used was DM 2954 (USD 1784) per participant in the treated group versus DM 4213 (USD 2545) in the placebo group. The estimates did not include the cost of dornase alfa itself, as this was not marketed at the time of the trial.</P>
<P>Similarly, the Menzin report analysed data from the Fuchs trial to estimate the reduction in cost of respiratory tract infection-related care (excluding the cost of dornase alfa itself) in the UK, France, Italy and Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menzin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzin 1996</LINK>). Variations in medical practice in these countries led to a range of cost reductions from GBP 434 (USD 700) in the UK to a maximum of FF 13,872 (USD 2100) in France.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dornase versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Dornase alfa improved lung function in trials of up to one month duration compared to placebo, mean difference (MD) in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) per cent (%) predicted 9.51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 18.35). This overall improvement was due to the improvement in participants with moderate disease severity, as demonstrated by a subgroup analysis of this group which showed an improvement, MD 14.26% (95% CI 10.79 to 17.74), compared to the group with severe disease which did not show any improvement, MD -2.81% (95% CI -8.77 to 3.15). Unfortunately there was only one trial which included participants with severe disease. We were not able to include participants with mild disease in the pooled result; however, one small trial including only participants with mild disease showed no change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, MD 0.08% (95% CI -5.59 to 5.74) (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>). The Amin trial also looked at lung clearance index (LCI) and identified a decrease in LCI of -0.90 (95% CI -1.87 to 0.07) in the dornase alfa group compared to placebo; this decrease was significant when baseline lung function was taken into account, which emphasizes the importance of using more sensitive measures of lung function in people with mild lung disease. There were fewer trials of longer duration, but FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was significantly better in the dornase alfa group in trials ranging from three months to two years. This included trials involving participants with severe disease (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>) as well as mild to moderate disease (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>). It was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis comparing trials using once-daily versus twice-daily dornase alfa, but the single large trial which compared these two interventions directly, did not find a difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>). Interestingly, one small trial that directly compared once-daily versus alternate-day dornase alfa also did not find a difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dornase alfa also decreased the number of participants experiencing pulmonary exacerbations, which is an important outcome measure in cystic fibrosis (CF). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) of a pulmonary exacerbation as 0.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.96) in participants receiving dornase alfa compared to control. Quality of life improved in some trials and was unchanged in others. Dornase alfa was well-tolerated and other than voice alteration, RR 1.69 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.39), and rash, RR 2.4 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.99), side effects were not more common than in the control group.</P>
<P>There have not been new trials examining the cost effectiveness of dornase alfa, but as concluded with earlier versions of this review, the healthcare costs of people treated with dornase alfa are lower (<LINK REF="REF-Oster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oster 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-der-Schulenburg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">von der Schulenburg 1995</LINK>). However, this saving only offsets between 18.3% to 37.5% of the cost of dornase alfa (<LINK REF="REF-Oster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oster 1995</LINK>). Given that the cost of dornase alfa has not decreased since 2010, these cost estimates are still relevant. One difficulty in interpreting the cost effectiveness of dornase alfa is that the cost benefits of improving lung function over the long term are difficult to model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dornase versus hyperosmolar agents</HEADING>
<P>Mucolytic and hyperosmolar agents are the most common groups of medications that help with mucous clearance. Unfortunately there are few high-quality trials comparing these two types of medication and none of the results could be pooled in this review because of differences in how outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>Trials of one month or less did not find a significant difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between hypertonic saline (HS) and dornase alfa (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2002</LINK>); whereas a three-month trial reported an improvement with dornase compared to HS, MD 8.00% (95% CI 2.00% to 14.00%) (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). The only trial comparing dornase alfa to mannitol did not find a difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between the two interventions, MD 0.02 L (95% CI -0.11 to 0.16); neither did this trial find a difference in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>when mannitol combined with dornase alfa was compared to dornase alfa alone, MD 0.10 L (95% CI -0.06 to 0.25) (<LINK REF="STD-Minasian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Minasian 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two trials reporting on the number of participants experiencing exacerbations found no difference between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Minasian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Minasian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Quality of life improved in some trials, but was unchanged in others.</P>
<P>Adverse events were not significantly different between the groups receiving dornase alfa and hyperosmolar agents, although 6% and 24% of potential participants experienced bronchoconstriction with the initial doses of HS and mannitol respectively, and were excluded from the trials.</P>
<P>Given that the cost of dornase alfa is 10 times that of HS, it is not surprising that the difference in the total health service cost was GBP 1409 (95% CI GBP 440 to GBP 2318) higher for the daily dornase alfa group compared to the HS group (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). However, this trial was only three months in duration and differences in the numbers of exacerbations were not significant, which would be expected to affect health service costs.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:16:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The objectives of this review were to determine if there was an improvement in morbidity or mortality with the use of dornase alfa, to identify any adverse events associated with the use of dornase alfa and to determine the efficacy of dornase alfa compared with other medications for improving airway clearance.</P>
<P>There is evidence to support the short-term benefit of dornase alfa in improving lung function; however, other outcomes such as the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations require trials of longer duration. The trial by Fuchs used data from a CF registry to determine that a trial lasting 48 weeks was needed to assess pulmonary exacerbations and only two of this review's included trials reporting on exacerbations as an outcome were of sufficient duration (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>). Given the improvement in prognosis for people with CF, it is difficult to detect differences in mortality unless trials include participants with severe disease and are long enough in duration. Only two trials included participants with severe disease making it difficult to reach firm conclusions on the effect of dornase alfa on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1995a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dornase alfa is approved for use as a once-daily medication in most countries. Different dose frequency regimens of dornase alfa were used in this review; ranging from alternate-day use to twice-daily use; only two trials compared these regimens directly (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). In the trial comparing once-daily to twice-daily dornase alfa, there was a similar improvement in lung function between the groups, although only the twice-daily group showed a significant decrease in the number of participants experiencing an exacerbation. It is not clear from the current evidence if an alternate-day regimen would be equally efficacious as this has only been studied in one small trial of three months duration.</P>
<P>More data are needed comparing dornase to hyperosmolar agents before definitive conclusions can be reached.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:37:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Most trials were judged to have a low risk of performance, detection, reporting and attrition bias. Many of the included trials did not have enough information in the publication to determine if there was a risk of selection bias. This reduces the strength of evidence available. Also, the pooled results for lung function from the shorter trials showed considerable heterogeneity and although this may be explained by the subgroup analysis by disease severity; this heterogeneity reduces the strength of evidence in favour of using dornase alfa.</P>
<P>According to the GRADE approach, the quality of the evidence in the trials which compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa treatment was judged to be moderate to high quality for lung function outcomes and exacerbations. The quality of the evidence for quality of life was limited for this comparison and therefore judged to be low. The quality of the evidence for dornase alfa compared to other controls (HS, mannitol or daily dornase alfa compared to alternate days) was limited and from open label trials and therefore judged to be low.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-17 10:55:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For this review, we searched all relevant sources for potential trials and the inclusion of hand-searching abstracts from the North American and European Cystic Fibrosis Conferences increases the likelihood that all relevant trials have been identified.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-17 10:59:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>No other systematic reviews have been identified which compare the use of dornase alfa to placebo or control in people with CF. The Cochrane review of HS for people with CF included trials comparing dornase alfa to HS and identified the same trials as were included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Wark-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wark 2009</LINK>). The authors of that review concluded that HS should be recommended for use in CF, but not in preference to dornase alfa given that there was insufficient evidence of superiority and less evidence for long-term benefit in lung function.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:37:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Therapy with dornase alfa is associated with an improvement in lung function in short-term trials as well as longer trials lasting up to two years. Although there was no significant difference between groups in a trial lasting three years, lung function was not the primary outcome within this trial which was therefore not powered to detect differences in lung function. There was a reduction in the risk of infective exacerbations using a once-daily regimen, RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.96). Not all people with CF increase their lung function with dornase alfa, but the effects on lung function are seen in within one month; therefore, if dornase alfa is started for this indication, a one-month trial should detect improvements in lung function. It should be noted that improvements in lung function did not predict which individuals experienced a decrease in exacerbations with dornase alfa in the single trial that examined this (<LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>); thus, a longer trial may be needed to assess this outcome in people with CF.</P>
<P>The effect of dornase alfa on mortality is inconclusive due to trials of short duration.</P>
<P>Dornase alfa is a well-tolerated therapy with only voice alteration and rash being reported with increased frequency in groups treated with dornase alfa.</P>
<P>Data from comparative trials of dornase alfa and hyperosmolar agents, suggests that dornase alfa is superior to HS in improving lung function, but there was no reported difference in the time to or frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. However, the longest trial to assess this was three months in duration, which is likely not long enough to detect differences in pulmonary exacerbations. There was no differences detected between dornase alfa and mannitol; and in the first trial to assess a combination of dornase with a hyperosmolar agent compared to either agent alone, there was no improvements noted with the combination of medications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-10 15:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There is a paucity of data looking at the efficacy of dornase alfa in children under the age of six years. Given the early development of lung disease in children with CF and the increased availability of lung function testing in children under six years of age, further trials should be undertaken in this age group.</P>
<P>Further comparative trials need to be run before the optimal dosing regimen of dornase alfa can be determined (alternate-day versus once-daily versus twice-daily), particularly for the outcome of pulmonary exacerbations. There is also a need for trials of a longer duration to determine if dornase alfa is superior to hyperosmolar agents, and if there is additive benefit of using both dornase alfa and hyperosmolar agents. Given that these different regimens have implications for cost as well as treatment burden, further data will be important to determine the optimal regimen.</P>

<LI>Two outcome measures have been added to the primary outcome of changes in lung function: lung clearance index and forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (FEV<SUB>0.5</SUB> ). Lung clearance index has the potential to detect onset of patchy respiratory involvement in CF in mild or early lung disease. FEV<SUB>0.5</SUB> is a more valid measure in young children because of short expiratory times.</LI>
<LI>The outcome 'Mean number of deaths' has been moved from 'Primary outcomes' to 'Secondary outcomes', since current Cochrane policy is to limit the number of primary outcomes to three.</LI>
<LI>In a <I>post hoc</I> change, in line with Cochrane guidance, the authors have presented five summary of findings tables; one for each comparison including the primary outcomes of the review at the three or six months follow up, or both.</LI>

At one year, one study showed a significant advantage to dornase alfa over placebo or no dornase alfa treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Quan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 2001</LINK>) and at three years, one study showed no significant difference between treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Downgraded due to indirectness: participants in <LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK> had severe lung disease (FVC below 40%).</P>
<P>3. No evidence of imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias or serious risk of bias.</P>

One study not included in pooled analysis showed a significant advantage in relative FVC (L) to dornase alfa over placebo or no dornase alfa treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>) and one study showed no significant different in absolute FVC (% predicted) between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>) at one month.

<P>5. Additionally, four studies reported quality of life data which could not be included in pooled analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Wilmott-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilmott 1996</LINK> showed no difference between groups in CFQ-R. Ramsey reported that the frequency and magnitude of improvement across all quality of life questions was greater among participants receiving dornase alfa (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 1993</LINK>). Ranasinha reported significant improvements in overall well-being and significant improvements in general well-being, cough frequency and chest congestion (<LINK REF="STD-Ranasinha-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ranasinha 1993</LINK>) and Fuchs reported significant improvements in well-being score and dyspnoea score on dornase alfa compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>6. Downgraded once for lack of applicability: Amin included children only so results are not applicable to adults (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Downgraded once for imprecision: wide confidence intervals around the effect size due to limited sample size of the trial.</P>
<P>8. Additionally, one study reported an age-adjusted RR of having more than one respiratory exacerbation, but these data were not included in the pooled analysis (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1996</LINK>). No significant difference was found between dornase alfa and control.</P>
<P>9. Downgraded once as data from one cross-over trial was analysed as parallel data (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2011</LINK>), which is a conservative approach.</P>
