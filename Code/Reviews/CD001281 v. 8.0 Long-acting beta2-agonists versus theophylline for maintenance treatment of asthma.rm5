I have also tweaked what's new to mention that GIV is now included.&lt;br&gt;This looks fine. Ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing April 10 2007&lt;br&gt;Thanks for sorting out the GIV analysis Toby. I have amended the label on graph 1#10 and I have reversed the labels on 1#11 (please check). I have also changed the SE for Selby in 1#4 so that it matches 1#5 (it was 142 previously which I think may have been a typo - again please check), and changed the confidence interval for the pooled result in the text. &lt;br&gt;There is a major discrepancy between the abstract results and the main text for FEV1, and I do not think single study results should be highlighted in the abstract so I have removed the following: &amp;quot;Salmeterol improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) significantly more than theophylline in five studies and salmeterol use was associated with significantly more symptom free nights in twelve of the studies comparing these agents. There was some inconsistency between outcomes where meta-analysis of lung function was possible. This may be related to the lack of common noutcome measurement.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have added the new pooled PEF data, and changed the conclusion sentence (left in red).&lt;br&gt;I have removed the reported advantage of salmeterol for night symptoms from the synopsis and abstract as this does not appear to be a pooled result. It is stated that eight studies favoured salmeterol for night symptoms. Perhaps we need to add a note saying why this could not be pooled - indeed would this now be possible with GIV I wonder.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;PS this is a substantive update as the new analysis changes the results.&lt;br&gt;=========================================================&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the very late reply, as I am in the midst of starting work at another hosp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the your further analysis of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reviewers' conclusions in the Abstract section, and the Main section should now read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-acting beta-2 agonists, particularly salmeterol, are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening PEF, but are equivalent in their effect on FEV1. There is some evidence of decreased nocturnal symptoms and daytime short-acting beta agonist requirement with salmeterol than theophylline. Fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta-2 agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline.&lt;br&gt;Looking forward to your favourable reply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;br&gt;Augustine&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Dear Augustine,&lt;br&gt; Please see the attached review - I have amended&lt;br&gt;this to reflect the analysed data. I have also been through the older&lt;br&gt;studies and extracted data by GIV where this is available.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Feb 6th 2007&lt;br&gt;I think we need to bite the bullet in relation to the analysis of cross-over studies in this review. Many of the studies are reported as showing significant differences between LABA and theophylline but not able to have their data entered for meta-analysis. Now that Generic Inverse Variance is available for cross-over studies this should be used to enter the individual patient comparisons using the paired t-test data from the papers and the p value or confidence interval to back-calculate the Standard Error of the difference. For adverse event data we really need 2x2 tables showing which patients had adverse events with LABA, theophylline, both or neither. Is this available in the papers reporting cross-over trials. You may need statistical help with these changes - do you have a statistician locally who can assist you with this.&lt;br&gt;At present I cannot tell how you have entered data from the new crossover study or any of the previous ones (except one study where first arm data has been used). We need to be careful not to give a wrong message by failing to enter data appropriately from the cross-over studies. First arm data is underpowered in comparison to paired t-tests.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;PS I have activated links to the new study so please work from this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Edit 25_3_3&lt;br&gt;I HAVE MADE A FEW COSMETIC CHANGES AS SHOWN BELOW IN CAPS AND THIS IS NOW READY TO GO ON TO THE LIBRARY AS AN UPDATED REVIEW&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all your hard work!&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers: reads as if one author assessed and extracted the new papers alone. The results section says 2 independent reviewers, so could this be reflected here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These six studies included a total of 526 patients. The meta-analysis including these studies confirmed the conclusions of the original review that both long-acting beta-agonists and theophylline are effective in the treatment of asthma, however the long-acting beta-agonists are associated with fewer adverse effects.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*****How do you know they are both effective unless comparing with placebo? I have changed the emphasis by adding ' similar in effectiveness'....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: ****Could Jo expand the references and add dates of protocol and first publication of the review please? DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Graphs: Scales have been adjusted to show confidence intervals but ****graph labels need reversing for some of the lung function outcomes and the negative signs stripped out. Our convention now is to enter data as real figures for PEF and FEV1 but label the graph to show that favours salmeterol is on the right of no effect. *****Also please turn off totals for single outcomes and especially where data is entered twice from the same patients. I cannot tell which way around symptoms scores should be (as the scales vary in direction but it is correct at present if a higher score is worse) and I do not know whether ECP is a good or bad outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!(80403) LS edit - Graph labels reversed, negative signs stripped out.&lt;br&gt;Totals turned off for single outcomes, also where data entered twice from same patients.&lt;br&gt; A higher symptom score is worse.&lt;br&gt;The rise in ECP is an indicator of inflammatory response,hence a bad outcome. The decrease in levels seen with Theophylline is beneficial.&lt;br&gt;FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: same issue with reporting that both drugs are effective with no data from this review to support this. I have reworded this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: ****Could Karen check the search strategy and add date of last search to abstract please? *****Results reporting in the abstract does not reflect the data presented on efficacy in the Meta-analysis. This is all based on single studies and we don't usually report single study results as main outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE BY CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &amp;quot; ii) Blinding of Interventions&lt;br&gt;All the included studies were described as blinded, using a double-dummy approach.&amp;quot; This is listed in Methodological quality - do you mean you described whether they were blinded? Were all the new studies blind and double dummy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;!!!080403 LS edit - It was described whether the studies were blinded in the table of included studies.&lt;br&gt;Three of the new studies were described as double blind and double dummy: Malolepszy, Ukena and Weigand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;**What is your policy on combining parallel and cross-over trial data. You seem to have done this for adverse effects and it is not strictly correct as RevMan does not handle cross-over data properly (unless you have entered first arm data only from the papers?)&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Sub-group Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sub-group analysis was conducted based on study design&lt;br&gt;Cross-over only,&lt;br&gt;Parallel group only&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;Could the adverse event data be re-entered in RevMan under sub-groups of parallel and cross-over trials so the reader can see this for themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you say what method you used to calculate the NNTs (RR and pooled control event rate or inverse of RD for example)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 - LS edit - Inverse of RD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics Table: *** Please add the abbreviations used to footnotes. Were Pastorello and Yurdakul parallel or cross-over?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 LS edit - Abbreviations used were added to footnotes. Pastorello and Yurdakul were parallel studies (mentioned in the table of characteristics of included studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: Beta-agonists changed to beta-2 agonists throughout for consistency. &amp;quot;Two studies used formeterol (Malolepszy 2002, Yurdakul 2002) as the long acting beta-2 agonist.&amp;quot; I have added formeterol to this above sentence.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The effects of therapy on lung function was measured and reported as FEV1 (% predicted) in 11 out of 12 studies and as PEF in 8 out of 12 studies.&amp;quot; ******This is not reflected in the single studies with data in Metaview - what is going on here please? It is very misleading to show results from the single study that found a difference in FEV1 and not the other five that did not find a difference!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 LS edit - Nutini- FEV1 data not mentioned in tables, only as a graph. PEFR data already entered previously.&lt;br&gt;Pastorello - PEFR data available but no SD mentioned. No FEV1 data in the study tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weigand - No data on FEV1 or PEFR values in tables.Only mean FEV1 mentioned, no SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukena - Both FEV1 and PEF values reported as range and median (though change from baseline mentioned).Nocturnal PEF values also reported as median and range.This fact mentioned in the table of characteristics of included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malolepszy - Data for FEV1 mentioned as mean% change from baseline and SD (table 2, page 81). I am not sure how to combine the SD values for change from baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There were significantly more symptom free nights with salmeterol, but inconsistent reporting of data precluded meta-analysis.&amp;quot; Same problem here. What is preventing the data being entered? SMD can be used if the results are all change from baseline (even if they are in different units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 LS edit: Nutini - The use of rescue medication during day and night mentioned in the literature of study as mean but no SD, rate of symptom -free days and nights also mentioned but as mean, no SD. Morning and evening PEF already entered in our tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastorello - Symptom - free days and nights mentioned in table 4 but as mean, no SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukena - For evaluation of nocturnal asthma -morning and evening PEF mentioned(table 5- page 321) but as median and range, rescue medication use during day and night already mentioned in table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weigand - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores mentioned as mean but no SD given (table 4 in article). As metioned above mean nocturnal FEV1 mentioned but no SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yurdakul- data for symptom -score and rescue med. use already entered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malolepszy- data for asthma score and rescue med. Use mentioned as graphs only, no table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Data for the adverse events in Yurdakul 2002 was in percentages only , so could not be compared with the other studies.&amp;quot; Could the percentages be converted into numbers of patients and entered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 LS edit: Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;****No results of the subgroup analysis from the parallel and cross-over studies are shown or reported. [TJL - HAVE REPORTED THE PARALLEL GROUP DATA - THE NNT WILL NEED REVISION]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 LS edit: NNT revised. Crossover group data entered. NNT IN ABSTRACT ALTERED TO MATCH FULL TEXT FOR ADVERSE EVENTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This review compares long-acting beta-2 agonists with theophylline in the treatment of moderate asthma in 1329 patients in twelve studies. This review found that whilst salmeterol and theophylline were both effective in increasing lung function, salmeterol was more effective in treating nocturnal symptoms such as night waking and need for rescue medication. The differences in the beneficial effects of salmeterol over theophylline did not reach statistical significance.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I cannot agree with this summary on the basis of presented data. Please consider a rewrite for this (if possible when more complete data from the trials has been entered into the Comparisons and Data table). I do not think you can assert that salmeterol is more effective and follow this with a blanket statement that statistical significance was not reached?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!!080403 LS edit: All the individual studies show that salmeterol is more effective then theophylline but because I have not been able to combine the data in this meta-analysis my statistics do not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i HAVE AMENDED THE DISCUSSION TO REFLECT THIS (CJC)&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The pooled difference in the beneficial effects of salmeterol over theophylline did not reach statistical significance, but this may relate to the fact that many of the studies did not present data suitable for meta-analysis and all of the individual studies reported significantly less symptom-free nights with salmeterol over theophylline. This review also reported significantly fewer adverse events with salmeterol as compared to theophylline. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; I HAVE ALSO AMENDED THE RESULTS IN THE ABSTRACT SLIGHTLY&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Salmeterol improved FEV1 significantly more than theophylline in five studies and salmeterol use was associated with significantly more symptom free nights in all the studies comparing these agents.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Long-acting beta-2 agonists are at least as effective than theophylline in reducing asthma symptoms including night waking and improving lung function. Fewer adverse events occurred in subjects using long-acting beta-2 agonists(salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The study designs were a mixture of cross over (6 studies) and parallel design (6 studies). Despite this difference in design, the results were the same.&amp;quot; This conclusion is not supported by the data presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Parallel and cross-over data. Counting studies if they achieve a significant difference. &amp;quot;Missing&amp;quot; data in the comparisons table. Conclusions an discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: BY TJL - 02/04/03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to reviewers for response please.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review compared three asthma medications, salmeterol, formoterol (both long acting beta-agonists) and theophylline. These medications are used to help control symptoms of asthma, especially those which occur during the night. This review found that salmeterol showed a greater improvement in lung function, and reduced the need for extra short-term inhalers in the day and the night. Salmeterol and formoterol are less likely to produce side-effects (such as headaches and nausea) when compared to theophylline.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Theophylline and long acting beta-2 agonists are bronchodilators used for the management of persistent asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. They represent different classes of drug with differing side-effect profiles.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the comparative efficacy, safety and side-effects of long-acting beta-2 agonists and theophylline in the maintenance treatment of adults and adolescents with asthma.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All included studies were RCTs involving adults and children with clinical evidence of asthma. These studies must have compared oral sustained release and/or dose adjusted theophylline with an inhaled long-acting beta-2 agonist.</P>

<P>In original review, two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, similarly in this update two reviewers undertook this. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen studies with a total of 1344 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review. They were of varying quality. There was no significant difference between salmeterol and theophylline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> predicted (6.5%; 95% CI -0.84 to 13.83). However, salmeterol treatment led to significantly better morning PEF (mean difference 16.71 L/min, 95% CI 8.91 to 24.51) and evening PEF (mean difference 15.58 L/min, 95% CI 8.33 to 22.83). Salmeterol also reduced the use of rescue medication. Formoterol, used in two studies was reported to be as effective as theophylline. Bitolterol, used in only one study, was reported to be less effective than theophylline. Participants taking salmeterol experienced fewer adverse events than those using theophylline (Parallel studies: Relative Risk 0.44; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.63, Risk Difference -0.11; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.07, Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT) 9; 95% CI 6 to 14). Significant reductions were reported for central nervous system adverse events (Relative Risk 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86, Risk Difference -0.07; 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02, NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50) and gastrointestinal adverse events (Relative Risk 0.30; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55, Risk Difference -0.11; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.06, NNT 9; 95% CI 6 to 16).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Long-acting beta-2 agonists, particularly salmeterol, are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening PEF, but are not significantly different in their effect on FEV1. There is evidence of decreased daytime and nighttime short-acting beta-2 agonist requirement with salmeterol. Fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta-2 agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-05 11:42:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Theophylline is used for the management of asthma in people with persistent symptoms. It is a bronchodilator that relieves bronchospasm and increases airway calibre. The actual mechanism of theophylline is unknown. It inhibits phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that degrades cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and high cAMP concentrations are associated with bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Theophylline may reduce mucosal permeability and thereby reduce plasma and macromolecular leakage across both the endothelial and epithelial barriers. It may also attenuate development of asthma inflammation after allergen challenge. In clinical practice, theophylline may have a role in the treatment of patients with severe persistent asthma who require multiple asthma therapy. Oral sustained release theophylline is also used in the management of nocturnal asthma. </P>
<P>The benefits of theophylline are limited by its toxicity. It has a narrow therapeutic index requiring dose titration and regular monitoring of serum concentrations to avoid adverse effects. Therapeutic plasma levels are generally accepted to be 55 to 110 micromol/L (10 to 20 mg/L), although recent reports suggest 5 to 15 mg/L as being acceptable. Many patients on theophylline experience toxic systemic effects, even with concentrations in the therapeutic range. Side-effects of theophylline include anorexia, nausea, headache and sleep disturbance. Altered mood and behaviour are sufficiently common to limit theophylline use in young children. There are also concerns that this drug may adversely affect concentration and cognitive skills in children. Theophylline may also aggravate underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux.</P>
<P>Long acting beta-2 agonists produce significant bronchodilation by the same pharmacological mechanism as other beta-2 agonists, i.e. stimulation of beta-2 receptors. These increase cAMP and produces functional antagonism, leading to reversal of bronchoconstriction.</P>
<P>Long-acting beta-2 agonists are added to anti-inflammatory therapy for the long term control of symptoms in persistent asthma, control of nocturnal asthma, and to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. The duration of bronchodilation lasts for up to 12 hours after administration. Long-acting beta-2 agonists also protect against a wide range of bronchoconstricting stimuli, inducing exercise, allergen, histamine and methacholine. Side-effects of long-acting beta-2 agonists are similar to those of short acting beta-2 agonists and include tachycardia, tremor, and headaches. With regular use, tachyphylaxis develops to the broncho protective effects of long-acting beta-2 agonists.</P>
<P>Other side effects which can occur with regular short-acting beta-2 agonists use are currently under evaluation. These include worsening airway responsiveness, worsening allergen induced airway inflammation and loss of asthma control. Recently, there is also concern, from a meta-analysis, that use of long-acting beta-2 agonists is associated with more severe and life-threatening exacerbations, as well as asthma-related deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both theophylline and long-acting beta-2 agonists can be used for control of asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. They represent different classes of drugs with differing side-effect profiles. This review compares their relative efficacy and safety.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review compares long-acting beta-2 agonists with theophylline in the treatment of moderate asthma in 1344 patients in thirteen studies. This review found that salmeterol and theophylline were both effective in treating nocturnal symptoms such as night waking and need for rescue medication. Salmeterol showed a greater improvement in PEF compared to theophylline. The pooled difference in the other beneficial effects of salmeterol over theophylline did not reach statistical significance, but this may relate to the fact that many of the studies did not present data suitable for meta-analysis and all of the individual studies, except <LINK REF="STD-Filiz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Filiz 2002</LINK>, reported significantly more symptom-free nights with salmeterol over theophylline. This review also reported significantly fewer adverse events with salmeterol as compared to theophylline. With regards to formoterol, another long-acting beta-2 agonist, the two studies found reported it to be as efficacious as theophylline in improving lung function, treating nocturnal asthma symptoms and use of rescue medication, but the number of participants was small. In this review, the efficacy of bitolterol, another long-acting beta-2 agonist was found to be less than theophylline.<BR/> <BR/>The quality of the studies was generally good. All were described as randomised trials with double-blinding. In communication with one author, the generation of random sequence and how it was concealed from the person allocating, was described. The results reported in this review apply to those participants who completed the studies (as stated in the Outcomes section). </P>
<P>The study designs were a mixture of crossover (seven studies) and parallel design (six studies). No differences in results were identified in relation to the different study design.</P>
<P>Nocturnal asthma is characterised by a significant reduction in airway calibre which is most apparent between the hours of 4 am and 7 am. It is frequently associated with disturbed sleep. Several different mechanisms of nocturnal exacerbations of asthma have been investigated, including circadian changes plasma cortisol, adrenal sympathetic hormones, and airway eosinophils. Short-acting bronchodilators provide insufficient protection against nocturnal attacks of asthma. Consequently, studies have investigated different therapies, including long-acting bronchodilators, corticosteroids and anticholinergics.</P>
<P>Salmeterol and theophylline are both effective means of treating asthma symptoms, especially episodes of nocturnal asthma. Salmeterol is an inhaled long-acting beta-2 agonist giving up to 12 hours of protection against bronchoconstricting stimuli. Theophylline is an oral, slow release, or dose-adjusted medication used for the management of asthma in people with persistent symptoms. It is usually monitored and dose adjusted according to the serum levels. Most of the studies in this review used dose-adjusted theophylline. </P>
<P>The studies showed a similar efficacy between salmeterol and theophylline, however salmeterol appeared to perform slightly better in the areas of lung function and nocturnal asthma. Two studies reported formoterol to have a similar efficacy as theophylline with regards to lung function and nocturnal asthma. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Zwillich-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zwillich 1989</LINK> reported that theophylline was more effective than bitolterol in terms of lung function and nocturnal waking. </P>
<P>Salmeterol is associated with adverse events including tachycardia, tremor, and headaches. Common adverse events associated with theophylline included anorexia, nausea, headache and sleep disturbance. Theophylline may also aggravate underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies in this review reported salmeterol as having fewer adverse events than theophylline. Meta-analyses of participants reporting adverse events, the total number of adverse events, and the number of participants with central nervous system and gastrointestinal adverse events, showed significantly fewer adverse events in those treated with salmeterol. This trend was also apparent for respiratory, ear, nose and throat, and cardiovascular adverse events, however there was insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis in these areas. One study in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Malolepszy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malolepszy 2002</LINK> also reported formoterol as having significantly fewer side- effects than theophylline.</P>
<P>There was no heterogeneity regarding the beneficial effects of salmeterol and it's fewer adverse effects as compared to theophylline.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Long-acting beta-2 agonists, particularly salmeterol, are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening PEF, but their effect on FEV1 is not significantly different. There is decreased nocturnal and daytime short-acting beta-2 agonist requirement with salmeterol rather than theophylline. Fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta-2 agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The following trials need to be done:</P>
<P>(1) Carry out cost analysis of long-acting beta-2 agonists versus theophylline</P>
<P>(2) Compare long-acting beta-2 agonists and theophylline in a paediatric asthma population</P>
