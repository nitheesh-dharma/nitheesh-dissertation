<P>There is no evidence of benefit from routine use of inhaled diuretics in preterm babies at risk of chronic lung disease. Lung disease in babies born early (preterm) is often complicated with excess accumulation of water in the lungs. Medications that reduce body water (diuretics) might help the baby recover from lung disease. In theory, giving the diuretic as an inhaled mist (aerosol) could drain water from the lung more than from the rest of the body, which could reduce adverse effects. The review found several small trials of a single type of diuretic (furosemide). A single dose improved lung function, but only temporarily. No information was available about long term outcome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-29 19:45:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is part of a group of three closely related reviews on diuretics in preterm infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), developing CLD or at high risk of CLD (Brion 1999 a,b). The present review will describe the evidence about administration of aerosolized diuretics in preterm infants with CLD, developing CLD or at high risk of CLD. The other two reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1999a</LINK>,b) will discuss the use of systemic loop diuretics and the use of diuretics acting on distal segments of the renal tubule (thiazides and spironolactone).</P>

<P>
<B>Rationale for administering aerosolized diuretics to neonates with CLD:</B>
<BR/>
<B>Reduction of lung edema:</B>
<BR/>Early stages of chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity are associated with lung edema. Factors involved in this edema include increased capillary permeability resulting from lung injury, congestive heart failure due to patent ductus arteriosus, and fluid overload (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 1995</LINK>). This edema could not only reduce pulmonary compliance (and thus tidal volume if using a pressure-limited ventilator) but also increase airway resistance by narrowing terminal airways (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>). Diuretics may accelerate lung fluid reabsorption and improve pulmonary mechanics in patients with lung edema via two types of mechanisms: (1) an immediate, diuresis-independent lung fluid reabsorption, and (2) a delayed increase in urine output (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1999a</LINK>). It is possible that the incidence of lung edema in preterm infants may have decreased as a result of changes in therapy introduced in the last decade (Gortner 1991; <LINK REF="REF-Sonntag-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonntag 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Reduction of bronchoconstriction:</B>
<BR/>Reactive airway disease may result from narrowing of the terminal airways secondary to interstitial edema (see 1.1) and from bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>). Infants with BPD may develop reactive airway disease (<LINK REF="REF-Denjean-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denjean 1992</LINK>) and benefit from bronchodilator therapy. Reactive airway disease in those infants may persist into childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both in children and in adults, aerosolized diuretic administration (furosemide, acetazolamide and amiloride) has been shown to alleviate reactive airway disease mediated by various stimuli (exercise, fog, metabisulfite, antigen) but not bronchoconstriction at rest or that secondary to metacholine challenge (<LINK REF="REF-Editorial" TYPE="REFERENCE">Editorial</LINK> 1990; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mochizuki-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mochizuki 1995</LINK>). In contrast, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel design failed to show any therapeutic effect of aerosolized furosemide in wheezing infants (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Bever-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Bever 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furosemide decreases smooth muscle contractility in vitro whether applied to the intraluminal (mucosal) or extraluminal side of the airway (<LINK REF="REF-Iwamoto-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwamoto 1997</LINK>). Several possible mechanisms of diuretic action (specifically, furosemide) on airway smooth muscle contractility have been proposed. First, furosemide, by inhibiting the basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter of the epithelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Frizzell-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frizzell 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welsh-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welsh 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavallee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavallee 1997</LINK>), could modify the osmotic and ionic environment, thereby possibly affecting the activation of mast cells and sensory epithelial nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Bienenstock-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bienenstock 1988</LINK>). Second, furosemide has been shown to decrease the release of inflammatory mediators, including leukotrienes and histamine produced by lung tissue in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1991</LINK>) and interleukin-6 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<LINK REF="REF-Yuengsrigul-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuengsrigul 1996</LINK>). Third, furosemide could release bronchodilator prostaglandins from airway epithelium, as shown with vascular endothelium (<LINK REF="REF-Lundergan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundergan 1988</LINK>) or kidney (see <LINK REF="REF-Brion-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1998</LINK>). The action of furosemide on bronchospasm has been shown to be reduced by indomethacin by some (<LINK REF="REF-Pavord-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavord 1992</LINK>) but not all authors (<LINK REF="REF-Rodwell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodwell 1997</LINK>). Finally, loop diuretics could inhibit cholinergic and excitatory non-cholinergic non-adrenergic contraction of bronchial muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Elwood-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwood 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, one may speculate that aerosolized diuretic administration might decrease bronchoconstriction in those infants with BPD who also have reactive airway disease.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-09-29 11:27:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diuretics:</B>
<BR/>So far, the only diuretic administered to neonates in aerosolized form is furosemide. Because of the long half-life of loop diuretics in immature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vert-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vert 1982</LINK>), a prolonged washout period (without diuretic administration) is needed if one wishes to eliminate any residual diuretic activity before initiating a clinical trial or between exposures in cross-over trials.</P>
<P>Only a small fraction of aerosolized furosemide reaches the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Medication deposition in the lung may range between 1 and 15% (Fok 1994, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Riordan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Riordan 1994</LINK>). Critical components may include (1) the type of nebulizer, which affects the size of the droplets (2) characteristics of the tubing, including length and temperature gradient, (3) the side flow which if too high will lead to bypassing the patient into the expiratory limb of the tubing, (4) humidity of inhaled gas and (5) whether the patient is ventilated or not (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fok-TF-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok TF 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Riordan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Riordan 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unless all these characteristics are provided, it may be difficult to estimate the amount of medication effectively received by the patient. Thus, negative data might result from either lack of efficacy of the medication on the lung, lack of delivery to the distal airway, or both.</P>
<P>Some of the effects on lung function may result from systemic absorption, as shown by increased urine output in some (Aufricht 1997; <LINK REF="REF-Seidenberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seidenberg 1992</LINK>) but not all studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Potential toxicity of diuretic administration include the following:</B>
<BR/>(1) hypovolemia, increased drug-induced nephrotoxicity (resulting at least in part from hypovolemia), hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyperuricemia and metabolic alkalosis.<BR/>(2) hypercalciuria (leading to nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and bone demineralization) and hyperphosphaturia (leading to osteopenia)<BR/>(3) increased incidence of patent ductus arteriosus<BR/>(4) cholelithiasis<BR/>(5) neurosensory hearing loss, resulting from high serum levels of furosemide associated with long half-life in immature infants.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-09-29 11:27:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Summary and rationale for aerosolized diuretic administration in CLD in preterm infants:</B>
<BR/>Diuretic administration could improve pulmonary mechanics by three separate mechanisms:<BR/>-immediate diuresis-independent reabsorption of lung fluid<BR/>-decrease in bronchospasm in patients with reactive airway disease<BR/>-delayed reabsorption of lung fluid mediated by a decrease in extracellular volume secondary to increased diuresis</P>
<P>The first two mechanisms would be expected to improve lung mechanics by local action, whereas the third mechanism requires systemic absorption. The rationale for using aerosolized diuretics is to try to alleviate lung disease without causing side effects secondary to systemic absorption.</P>

</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess risks and benefits of aerosolized diuretic administration in preterm infants with or developing chronic lung disease. <BR/>Primary objectives are to assess:<BR/>(1) short-term improvement: changes in mean airway pressure, need for artificial ventilation, need for continuous positive airway pressure, failure to tolerate extubation, and oxygen supplementation<BR/>(2) long-term improvement: mortality, duration of need for oxygen supplementation and respiratory support, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) defined as need for oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life, death or BPD, chronic lung disease at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (gestational age + postnatal age), length of stay, and number of rehospitalizations during the first year of life.<BR/>Secondary objectives are to assess changes in pulmonary mechanics after treatment and potential complications of diuretic administration.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included only randomized controlled studies. Randomization needed to involve the allocation of all patients either to a specific treatment (patients on diuretic vs controls on placebo or another therapy), or to a specific time of administration of the diuretic (diuretic first vs placebo first).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants needed to be: <BR/>(1) Preterm infants <BR/>(2) With oxygen dependency (&gt; 21% O2 to maintain pulse oximetry &gt; 90% or paO2 &gt; 50 mm Hg) or ventilator dependency secondary to lung disease beyond five days of life. <BR/>Although BPD is usually defined by the need for oxygen supplementation at four weeks of age, CLD already starts during the first few days of life in patients with RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>). For the present study, we only included studies with entry criteria of oxygen or ventilator dependence beyond five days, to avoid overlap with a systematic review of the use of diuretics in patients with RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1999c</LINK>). Thus, patients eligible for this study included those with CLD, those developing CLD and those at high risk of CLD.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention needed to include the administration of an aerosolized loop diuretic. Eligible studies were those that assessed either the administration of an aerosolized diuretic compared to placebo (or no treatment), the administration of an additional aerosolized diuretic compared to a single diuretic in controls, the administration of a different diuretic from that in controls, or administration of a diuretic using another mode compared to control therapy (typically enteral or intravenous furosemide).</P>

<P>Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study, using a form that had been designed specifically for this review. We transformed graphical data into numerical data using a millimetric ruler and an electronic spreadsheet. We replaced any standard error of the mean by the corresponding standard deviation (SD). As much as possible we homogenized units among studies; in some cases this required using a specific formula to estimate the SD of a ratio or a product (<LINK REF="REF-Baird-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In December 1998, we sent to each author an itemized letter requesting additional information about design, patients, methods, or original outcome data (if missing, incomplete or presented in graphical form). We obtained additional data from three authors: Dr. Ohki, Dr. Kugelman and Dr. Stefano (c/o Ms. Leef). Dr. Ohki kindly provided us with additional data, specifically, mean and standard deviation of measurements of pulmonary mechanics at baseline, one hr and two hr, as well as mean and standard deviation of the values at 1 hr and 2 hr expressed as percent of baseline.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-10-04 13:48:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, using a fixed effect model.<BR/>For dichotomous variables we analyzed the odds ratio (OR) to combine parallel trials with cross-over trials, using for cross-over trials an alternate odds ratio approach with an imputed correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). If the imputed correlation for all cross-over trials was zero, we analyzed relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD).<BR/>
<BR/>For continuous variables we combined parallel trials with cross-over trials using the inverse variance method (Handbook version 4.2.5, pages 117 and 159). We obtained the weighted mean difference (WMD) and its standard error (using a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for cross-over trials, or 0.3 for sensitivity analysis) between change scores in the treatment group and in the control group. Change scores were obtained either from the mean of individual differences between baseline and final values, from mean and SD (or standard error) values of change (or percent of baseline) provided by the authors, or from the means and SD of baseline and final values. In the latter case, the variance (var) of change was estimated using Follmann's (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) method, described in version 3.0.2 of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (page 213):<BR/>Var(change)=Var(pretest) + Var(posttest) - 2 x SD(pretest) x SD (posttest) x pretest-posttest correlation coefficient.<BR/>We searched the literature for values of pretest-posttest correlation coefficient (r) for each test, interval and patient group. If such data were not available, we assumed a value of 0.4, and conducted a sensitivity analysis by successively using r = 0.3 and r = 0.5.</P>
<P>
<BR/>For those studies providing mean and SD of baseline values and of the percent change from baseline, we obtained the mean change by multiplying percent change by the average baseline. Variance of change was calculated using established guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Baird-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1994</LINK>), as described elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1999a</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. Mean postnatal age:<BR/>Within each of the above groups, subgroups were determined based on mean postnatal age. The initial plan was to use a cut-off value of four weeks, based on the usual definition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, using this value would have made it impossible to classify two of the twenty studies included in this group of three related reviews on diuretics in preterm infants with (or developing) CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Singhal-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singhal 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>).Therefore, we selected a mean postnatal age of three wk as the cut-off for all three reviews.</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-29 19:47:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of nine studies were considered for this review. One was eliminated because it did not involve random allocation to diuretic administration (<LINK REF="STD-Suresh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Suresh 1992</LINK>). Thus, eight studies were included in the present review. Details reported by the authors are provided in the table. All studies but one were cross-over studies.</P>
<P>Almost all studies included in this review included dynamic measurements of pulmonary mechanics with or without an esophageal balloon. Static measurements were done in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>). Main categories (intervention) are shown as first entry in the column labeled 'Interventions.' No subcategories were used based on gestational age, because the maximum range of gestational age within each intervention group was four weeks. Main categories (based on intervention) and subcategories (based on postnatal age and mechanical ventilation) are described below:</P>
<P>1. Administration of furosemide by aerosol versus placebo:<BR/>This group included four studies, one with parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>), and three with cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>). Average gestational age ranged between 25 and 29 weeks, so that only one group was considered for the analysis. All patients required mechanical ventilation at study entry.</P>
<P>1.1. Average postnatal age &lt; 3 weeks</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1994</LINK>: cross-over design with pooled data. <BR/>This study was available as abstract only; additional data were provided by the authors. Six infants did not receive any diuretics before the study period. One patient in the control group had received diuretics two weeks before the study, and three patients had received one dose of furosemide during the last five days preceding the study (two in the control group and one in the treated group). Patients were randomized to receive either a daily dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide for two days followed by placebo, or vice-versa. There was no washout period between the two phases. An 'acorn' nebulizer with a capillary was placed in line on the ventilator circuit and the medication was mixed with 2 ml of normal saline and delivered at 6 L/min flow. The authors measured dynamic pulmonary mechanics. Change scores for tidal volume were estimated using Follmann's formula.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>: cross-over design with pooled data. <BR/>Patients were randomized to receive either a single dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide followed by placebo, or vice-versa. The washout period before the study was only six hours for thiazides, spironolactone, and furosemide. A 24 hour-washout period was documented at the time of cross-over. Change scores for tidal volume were estimated using Follmann's formula; those for compliance, resistance and transcutaneous pO2 were calculated from the authors' primary data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>: cross-over design with pooled data. <BR/>Patients were randomized to receive either a single dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide followed by a 48-hour washout period and then placebo, or vice-versa. A washout period of 48 hours was documented both before the study and at the time of crossover.</P>
<P>In patients on furosemide, change scores for pulmonary function tests were estimated by the mean of two results. First we used Baird and Armitage's method with the exact unpublished average and SD baseline values (see table of included studies) and percent values of baseline provided by Y. Ohki. Second, we calculated the mean of change scores for individual data extracted from figures 4-6. For patients in the control group, only the first method was available. Change scores for blood pH were estimated using Follmann's formula.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>: parallel design. <BR/>This study was available as abstract only. Patients were randomized to receive either 1 mg/kg of furosemide (the interval is not mentioned in the abstract) for seven days, or placebo. No washout period was documented. Change scores for tidal volume were estimated using Follmann's formula.</P>
<P>2. Administration of furosemide by aerosol versus intermittent intravenous furosemide administration in controls:<BR/>This group included two studies (Rastogi 92, Prabhu 97), both with a cross-over design.

<P>3. Comparison of various doses of aerosolized furosemide:<BR/>This group includes two studies (Prabhu 98 and Rastogi 94). They had similar gestational ages and postnatal ages. One study compared a dose of 1 mg/kg furosemide with lower doses (Rastogi 94). The other study compared a dose of 1 mg/kg with 2 mg/kg (Prabhu 98).

<P>
<B>1. Limitations of the scope of available studies:</B>
<BR/>Most studies focused on short-term pathophysiological parameters (pulmonary mechanics) and failed to assess the primary outcomes defined in this review (e.g., mean airway pressure or percent inspiratory oxygen) or the potential complications of diuretic therapy. No studies reported on need for or duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen supplementation, need for continuous positive airway pressure, BPD, death or BPD, chronic lung disease at 36 weeks of postconceptional age, mortality, length of stay, or number of rehospitalizations during the first year of life.</P>
<P>Furthermore, for most outcomes, only one or two studies provided data that could be merged into a meta-analysis, so that only a small number of patients was included in each analysis. Therefore, it is possible that real differences due to furosemide administration could have been missed. For each analysis we report the studies and the number of patients in which the particular outcome is reported.</P>
<P>No study assessed the amount of diuretic effectively delivered to the patient.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Calculation of WMD and estimation of the pretest-posttest correlation coefficient (r):</B>
<BR/>For most variables, r was assumed to be 0.4. Unless specified otherwise, sensitivity analysis using a value of 0.3 or 0.5 did not significantly alter the CI and the summary results.</P>
<P>Limited data on dynamic measurements in preterm infants (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>) suggest that r is higher for dynamic compliance (0.8 for a 1-hour or a 2-hour period) than for resistance (0.4 for a 2-hour, 0.7 for a 1-hour period). We used these values in our calculations of change scores with the Follmann's formula for several studies that analyzed the evolution of dynamic pulmonary mechanics over a period of maximum two hours (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis was done using r=0.4 (vs. 0.7-0.8 as the expected value) or 0.3 (vs. 0.4 as the expected value).</P>
<P>Serial data in patients on furosemide (<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>) yielded a higher value of r for static compliance (0.84 for 1-hour and 0.90 for a 2-hour period) and resistance (0.87 for a 1-hour and 0.91 for a 2-hour period) than for tidal volume (0.48 for a 1-hour and 0.32 for a 2-hour period). We did not use these values of r for calculating change scores; we used instead additional original data provided by Dr. Ohki.</P>
<P>WMD for tidal volume (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>) was calculated using Follmann's formula while assuming r = 0.4 for tidal volume, whereas WMDs for compliance and resistance were calculated from individual differences between baseline and final values. WMDs for Ohki's data were calculated using original mean and SD of percent values from baseline provided by the author.</P>

<B>Effects of aerosolized furosemide:</B>
<BR/>
<B>Comparison 1: Administration of furosemide by aerosol versus placebo<BR/>
</B>Introduction:<BR/>The effects of a two-day treatment with aerosolized furosemide on pulmonary mechanics were assessed in 22 patients &lt; 3 weeks of age enrolled in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1994</LINK>). Data on ventilatory support (n = 19 measurements in each group, provided by Dr. Stefano) showed identical values at the time of entry into the study and trends toward higher peak pressure, higher PEEP and higher FiO2 after furosemide administration than after placebo.<BR/>The effect of a single dose of furosemide on pulmonary mechanics in patients &gt; 3 weeks of age was analyzed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>). Measurements of pulmonary mechanics 30 minutes after furosemide administration were obtained in only five patients &gt; 3 weeks of age (<LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>). Seventeen patients were assessed one hour and two hours after aerosol administration (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>).<BR/>One trial assessed the effects of a seven day treatment with a daily dose of aerosolized furosemide in patients &gt; 3 weeks of age (<LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 1.1: Change in transcutaneous pO2 and Outcome 01.02: Change in blood pH</B>
<BR/>Furosemide administration did not significantly affect transcutaneous pO2 after one and two hours (n = 9 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>) or <B>Outcome 1.2</B> blood pH after one hour (n = 8 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 1.3: Change in compliance<BR/>
</B>In patients &lt; 3 weeks of age furosemide significantly decreased compliance 20 min after a single dose on the second of therapy (WMD -0.21 ml/cm H2O/kg, CI -0.38, -0.04) (<LINK REF="STD-Raval-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In patients &gt; 3 weeks of age, furosemide did not significantly affect compliance at 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>). It increased compliance at one hour and two hours in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>) but not in the other one (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>). Both tests for heterogeneity (chi-square and I-squared) were statistically significant for compliance at one hour and at two hours. Heterogeneity of response to furosemide could have resulted from differences in (1) washout period at study entry (48 hours for Ohki's study vs 6 hours for Kugelman's study) or at the time of cross-over (48 hours vs 24 hours, respectively), (2) blinding of intervention (only in the second study), (3) method of measuring mechanics of the total respiratory system (static for Ohki's study vs. dynamic without esophageal balloon for Kugelman's study), and (4) method of furosemide delivery (ultrasonic nebulizer [Ohki] vs. neonatal nebulizer with a relatively high side flow of 5 - 6 L/min [Kugelman]). Method of furosemide delivery is unlikely to account for heterogeneity, because the neonatal nebulizer used in the second study has been successfully used to deliver other medications, including B2 agonists, ipratropium bromide, and beclomethasone in ventilated infants with BPD (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>). Washout period is unlikely to account to heterogeneity because subgroup analysis of patients randomized to furosemide first and those randomized to placebo first in Kugelman's study (using data kindly provided by Dr. Kugelman) showed similar results.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 1.4: Change in resistance</B>
<BR/>Furosemide did not significantly affect resistance in any of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raval-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raval 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1993</LINK>), in any of the summary statistics or any of the subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 1.5: Change in tidal volume</B>
<BR/>One trials showed no significant effect of furosemide on tidal volume 20 min after the dose. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>) showed no significant effect of furosemide on tidal volume, and the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>) showed a significant increase in tidal volume after furosemide. Although meta-analysis showed that furosemide significantly improved tidal volume after one hour (WMD 1.86 ml/kg, CI 1.14, 2.59) and two hours (1.11 ml/kg, CI 0.28, 1.94), both the I squared test and the chi-square test showed significant heterogeneity. Severity of lung disease was similar in both studies (FiO2 0.30 vs 0.35, peak inspiratory pressure 20 vs 22 cm H2O).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 1.6: Change in minute ventilation</B>
<BR/>Furosemide did not significantly affect he change in minute ventilation 20 min after the dose, on the second day of treatment, in patients &gt; 3 weeks of age.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 2: Administration of furosemide by aerosol versus intermittent intravenous furosemide administration in controls</B>
</P>
<P>Change in oxygen administration <B>(Outcome 2.1)</B>, transcutaneous oxygen monitoring <B>(Outcome 2.2) </B>and ventilatory settings <B>(Outcome 2.3 - 2.5)</B>.<BR/>Aerosolized furosemide tended to decrease the percent inspiratory oxygen and to improve transcutaneous hemoglobin saturation after two hours (n = 19) (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>). Aerosolized furosemide did not affect peak inspiratory pressure, positive end expiratory pressure or ventilatory rate two hours after treatment (n = 19) (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 2.6: Change in compliance</B>
<BR/>Compared with intravenous furosemide, aerosolized furosemide tended to decrease compliance at 30 minutes in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>) and significantly increased compliance in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>). Aerosolized furosemide significantly improved compliance at one hour (WMD 0.15 ml/cm H2O/kg, CI 0.08, 0.23, n=24 patients) and at two hours (WMD 0.18 ml/cm H2O/kg, CI 0.09, 0.26, n = 24 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>). Lack of significance at four hours (WMD 0.23, CI -0.24, +0.70) may have resulted from the small number of patients available (n = 5 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>), from lack of a washout period, from overestimating the CI by using r = 0.4 in Follmann's formula, or from other factors that could not be analyzed in this study available as an abstract only.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Outcome 2.7: Change in resistance</B>
<BR/>Aerosolized furosemide significantly improved resistance in one study (WMD -30 cm/L/sec, CI -48, -12) (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>) and tended to increase resistance in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>). Meta-analysis showed no significant effect of aerosolized furosemide compared with intravenous furosemide on resistance between 30 min and two hours (n = 24). At at 30 min, both statistical tests for heterogeneity (chi-square and I-squared) were significant. Heterogeneity could have resulted from lack of a washout period in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>) but not the other one (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>), or from overestimating the CI using r = 0.4 in Follmann's formula. Other potential differences could not be analyzed or detected because Rastogi's study is only available as an abstract. Aerosolized furosemide significantly reduced resistance at four hours in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>) using a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for the cross-over trial (WMD -19.3, CI -36.9, - 1.7) but not using a correlation coefficient of 0.3 (CI -39.7, + 1.1).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 2.8: Change in tidal volume</B>
<BR/>Compared with intravenous furosemide, aerosolized furosemide tended to improve tidal volume at 30 min in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>) and to worsen tidal volume in the other one (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>). Meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity using the I-squared test but not the chi-square test. Aerosolized furosemide significantly improved tidal volume at one hour using a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for the cross-over trial (WMD 1.34 ml/kg, CI 0.12, +2.57, n = 24 patients) but not using a correlation coefficient of 0.3 (CI -0.07,+2.75) (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>). Aerosolized furosemide significantly improved tidal volume at two hours (WMD 1.8 ml/kg, CI 0.5, 3.1, n = 24) but not at four hours (n = 5) (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 3: 1 mg/kg aerosolized furosemide versus lower doses:<BR/>
</B>One study compared the effects of 1 mg/kg of furosemide with those of lower doses (n = 8 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes 3.1 - 3.3: Failure to improve pulmonary function</B>
<BR/>The authors found no effect of low doses of furosemide on pulmonary function, in contrast with a standard dose of 1 mg/kg. For this review, we arbitrary limited data entry into MetaView to data corresponding to 1.0 mg/kg (treatment) vs. 0.1 mg/kg (control). Results on pulmonary function would have been similar with any of the other low doses. Since no patient responded to the low dose, the imputed correlation was zero; therefore, we used the values calculated by RevMan for relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). In comparison with the lower dose, the standard dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide significantly decreased the risk of failure to improve compliance within 30 minutes (RR 0.13, CI 0.02, 0.78; RD -0.88, CI -1.16, -0.59) and 4 hours (RR 0.25, CI 0.08, 0.83; RD -0.75, CI -1.08, -0.42). The dose of 1 mg/kg decreased the risk of failure to improve resistance within 30 minutes (RR 0.13, CI 0.02,0.78; RD -0.88, CI -1.16, -0.59) and four hours (RR 0.13, CI 0.02,0.78; RD -0.88, CI -1.16, -0.59). The dose of 1 mg/kg decreased the risk of failure to improve tidal volume within 30 minutes (RR 0.06, CI 0.00, 0.87; RD -1.00, CI -1.21, -0.79) and four hours (RR 0.25, CI 0.08, 0.83; RD -0.75, CI -1.08, -0.42).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes 3.4 and 3.5: Urinary calcium excretion</B>
<BR/>Administration of a 1 mg/kg dose of aerosolized furosemide did not significantly affect 24-hour calciuria or urine calcium:creatinine ratio compared with a lower dose of furosemide.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 4: 2 mg/kg aerosolized furosemide versus lower doses:<BR/>
</B>A single studied analyzed the effects of the standard dose of 1 mg/kg with a higher dose of 2 mg/kg on pulmonary mechanics (n = 13 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 4.1: Change in compliance</B>
<BR/>In comparison with the lower dose, the dose of 2 mg/kg of furosemide significantly increased compliance after 2 hours using a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for the cross-over trial (WMD 0.10, CI 0.01,0.19) but not using a correlation coefficient of 0.3 (CI -0.07,+0.27). No significant difference was observed after four and six hours.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Outcome 4.2: Change in resistance</B>
<BR/>In comparison with the lower dose, the dose of 2 mg/kg of furosemide did not significantly affect resistance after 30 minutes or after six hours. It significantly increased resistance after four hours (WMD 37 cm/L/sec, CI 2.25, 71.75) using a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for the cross-over trial, but not using a correlation coefficient of 0.3 (CI -2.77, + 76.77).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 4.3: Change in tidal volume</B>
<BR/>In comparison with the lower dose, the dose of 2 mg/kg of furosemide did not significantly affect tidal volume.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome 4.4: Change in urine output</B>
<BR/>The higher dose tended to increase urine output compared with the lower dose, but this did not reach statistical significance.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-05 14:45:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Limitations<BR/>1.1. Limitations of the studies included in this review:<BR/>In five of eight studies blinding was either not documented or not done. This could potentially have biased the results in favor of furosemide.</P>
<P>1.2. Limitations of this review:<BR/>Outcomes analyzed:<BR/>Most studies focused on pathophysiological parameters, e.g., pulmonary mechanics, and did not assess the most important outcomes defined in this review or the potential complications of diuretic therapy.</P>
<P>Methods used for the analysis:<BR/>We used the methods recommended by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. For almost all studies, we did not have access to the original data. Therefore, we used multiple transformations using formulae established by or derived from Follmann, Baird, and Armitage. Calculations using Baird and Armitage overestimate the SD of the final variable if the numerator is related to the denominator, because they assume lack of correlation between them.</P>
<P>For calculations using Follman's formula, we usually assumed an pretest-posttest correlation of 0.4 and did a sensitivity analysis using a correlation coefficient of 0.3. We only used other values for r if they were available for preterm infants of similar size and age, for an identical test (e.g., compliance) performed at similar time intervals and using the same method. We have found higher values of average correlation coefficient for serial dynamic measurements of tidal volume (r = 0.72), compliance (r = 0.92) and resistance (r = 0.80) in full-term infants over a period of 66 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Goyal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goyal 1995</LINK>). We are unaware of similar data in very low birth weight infants. Therefore, in this review we may have overestimated the SD of long-term change scores for pulmonary mechanics, especially compliance. Therefore, the results are likely to be conservative, i.e., confidence intervals may be wider than they should be.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity:<BR/>Within each subgroup, we used chi-square analysis to test for statistical evidence of heterogeneity among studies. When heterogeneity analysis was significant, we analyzed differences (in patient selection, baseline values, bias, design and methods) among studies that could possibly explain the heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Heterogeneity in response did not appear to result from differences in methods used for pulmonary function tests. Dynamic measurements were obtained in three (<LINK REF="STD-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prabhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rastogi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rastogi 1992</LINK>, Rastogi 94) of four studies showing a transient improvement of pulmonary mechanics 1 to 2 hours after a single dose of furosemide on pulmonary mechanics and in the single study showing no effect (<LINK REF="STD-Kugelman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kugelman 1997</LINK>). Static measurements were obtained in one study, which showed a transient improvement in pulmonary mechanics after furosemide (<LINK REF="STD-Ohki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohki 1997</LINK>). The reader is referred elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1999a</LINK>) for further discussion of methods of measuring pulmonary mechanics.</P>
<P>Because of the long half-life of loop diuretics in immature infants, a prolonged washout period is required to eliminate all diuretic effect before initiating a study or between exposures in a cross-over study. However, a prolonged washout period may not be possible or ethically acceptable for patients considered clinically to require diuretics. Several studies had a short or no washout period, thereby possibly decreasing the apparent effect of diuretic administration on short- and long-term outcome. All cross-over trials failed to provide information that would rule out a carry-over effect (possibly yielding an underestimation of the real effect of diuretic administration) and a period effect.</P>
<P>All studies failed to demonstrate actual delivery of furosemide to the distal airways. None measured the percent recovery of furosemide in the expiratory tubing or serum levels of furosemide.</P>
<P>Sample size:<BR/>Because of small sample size in most of the subgroups, any real effects of furosemide may have remained undetected.</P>
<P>2. Group-specific comments:<BR/>Studies only included intubated patients.</P>
<P>In infants &lt; 3 weeks of age, available evidence (single study, pulmonary mechanics measured only after 20 minutes, abstract only) shows no benefit of a two-day course of aerosolized furosemide.</P>
<P>In infants &gt; 3 weeks of age, a single aerosolized dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide transiently (at one to two) improves compliance compared with intravenous furosemide but does not affect resistance or tidal volume. Four of six studies have shown that a single dose of 1 mg/kg of aerosolized furosemide was more effective in transiently improving compliance than placebo, iv furosemide or a lower dose of aerosolized furosemide. The single study assessing the effect of chronic administration of a daily dose of aerosolized furosemide showed no effect on pulmonary mechanics. This study was published as an abstract only, had no documented washout period, and included only 10 patients.</P>
<P>Double-blinded studies are needed (1) to analyze factors likely to affect the response to aerosolized diuretics, e.g., washout period and delivery of furosemide to distal airways, and (2) to assess the effects of chronic administration of aerosolized diuretics on O2- and ventilator-dependency and long-term outcome.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Most studies focused on pathophysiological parameters and did not assess the most important outcomes defined in this review or the potential complications of diuretic therapy. </P>
<P>In infants &gt; 3 weeks of age with CLD, a single aerosolized dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide may transiently improve pulmonary mechanics. There is no evidence to support any benefit of aerosolized diuretic administration on need for ventilatory support, length of stay, survival or long-term outcome. In view of the lack of data from randomized trials concerning effects on important clinical outcomes, routine or sustained use of aerosolized loop diuretics in infants with (or developing) CLD cannot be justified based on current evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Investigators planning randomized trials should consider (1) using double-blinded design (2) analyzing factors likely to affect the response to aerosolized furosemide, e.g., washout period and delivery of furosemide to distal airways, and (3) assessing, in addition or instead of short-term outcome, the effects of chronic administration of aerosolized furosemide on mortality, O2 dependency, ventilator dependency, length of hospital stay and long-term outcome.</P>

Of 11 eligible infants, informed consent was denied in 3.

</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Number of patients entered into the study: n=8<BR/>Mechanical ventilation<BR/>Entry criteria: history of RDS requiring mechanical ventilation at birth, postnatal age &gt; 14 days, persistence of respiratory failure and dependence on O2 and mechanical ventilation, radiographic evidence of chronic pulmonary parenchymal disease, no drug therapy other than vitamins for at least 72 hours before the start of the study<BR/>Exclusion criteria: evidence of congenital malformations, infection, congenital heart defect, or congenital heart disease.<BR/>Mean birth weight was 815±297 g and mean gestational age was 27.4±1.6 weeks. At the time of the study, postnatal age was 33±13 days, postconceptional age 32.1±2.5 weeks and weight 1013±331 g. Mean peak inspiratory pressure was 19.3±1.0 cm H2O, mean airway pressure 7.9±1.5 cm, FiO2 0.45±0.17, and ventilatory rate 30±12 per minute. Blood pH was 7.33±0.07 and pCO2 was 44±8 mm Hg.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Aerosolized furosemide 0.1 vs 0.25, 0.5 ,1 mg/kg<BR/>Patients successively received in random order four different doses of aerosolized furosemide: 0.1 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg. Furosemide was made up to a final volume of 2 ml with 0.9% NaCl.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Compliance improved in 0/8 patients after a low dose of furosemide, compared to 7/8 at 30 minutes and 6/8 at 4 hours after a dose of 1 mg/kg. Resistance decreased in 0/8 patients after a low dose of furosemide, compared to 7/8 at 30 minutes and at 4 hours after a dose of 1 mg/kg. Tidal volume increased in 0/8 patients after a low dose of furosemide, compared to 8/8 at 30 minutes and 6/8 at 4 hours after a dose of 1 mg/kg. Urine output, urinary calcium, calcium/creatinine ratio, fractional excretion of sodium and creatinine clearance were similar after each of the 4 doses of furosemide, suggesting that aerosolized furosemide had no effect on the kidney.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>There is no information about efficacy of the method of nebulization, so that the exact amount of drug reaching the distal airways is not sure. <BR/>Pulmonary function was measured at baseline, then at 30 min, 1,2 and 4 hours after aerosol administration. Pulmonary mechanics were measured using the least mean square method. The FiO2 was adjusted during measurement of pulmonary mechanics to maintain hemoglobin saturation &gt;94 %. Patients did not receive sedation; most were in quiet but active sleep state during testing. Urine was collected for 24 hours after each dose of diuretic. <BR/>The authors state that doses of 0.1-0.5 mg/kg had no effect on pulmonary function; however, no data are provided, so this information cannot be used for meta-analysis. Furthermore, no data are provided to support that a dose of furosemide of 0.1 mg/kg had no effect on urine output. For this meta-analysis, we assumed that 0.1 mg/kg of furosemide had no significant effect on any of the variables and thus can be considered as a placebo.</P>
