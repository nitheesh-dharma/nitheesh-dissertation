<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-18 22:00:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Impetigo causes blister-like sores. The sores can fill with pus and form scabs, and scratching can spread the infection. Impetigo is caused by bacteria. It is contagious and usually occurs in children. It is the most common bacterial skin infection presented by children to primary care physicians. Treatment options include topical antibiotics (antibiotic creams), oral antibiotics (antibiotics taken by mouth), and disinfectant solutions. There is no generally agreed standard treatment, and the evidence on what intervention works best is not clear.</P>
<P>We identified 68 randomised controlled trials comparing various treatments for impetigo. Altogether, these studies evaluated 26 oral treatments and 24 topical treatments, including placebo, and results were described for 5708 participants.</P>
<P>Overall, topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than topical placebo.</P>
<P>Two antibiotic creams, mupirocin and fusidic acid, are at least as effective as oral antibiotics where the disease is not extensive. There was no clear evidence that either of these most commonly studied topical antibiotics was more effective than the other.</P>
<P>Topical mupirocin was superior to the oral antibiotic, oral erythromycin.</P>
<P>We found that the oral antibiotic, oral penicillin, is not effective for impetigo, while other oral antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin and cloxacillin) can help.</P>
<P>It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo.</P>
<P>There is a lack of evidence to suggest that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments.</P>
<P>Reported side-effects for topical treatments were mild and low in frequency; the treatments sometimes resulted in itching, burning, or staining. Oral antibiotics produced gastrointestinal complaints, such as nausea and diarrhoea, in 2% to 30% of participants, depending upon the specific antibiotic.</P>
<P>Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.</P>

<P>Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-18 21:43:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-19 06:09:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Doney">
<P>We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-22 10:55:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this.</P>
<P>For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11).</P>
<P>In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08).</P>
<P>There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32).</P>
<P>The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference.</P>
<P>Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-20 13:49:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.</P>

<P>Impetigo or impetigo contagiosa is a contagious superficial bacterial skin infection most frequently encountered in children. It is typically classified as either primary (e.g. direct bacterial invasion of previously normal skin), secondary, or common impetigo (where the infection is secondary to some other underlying skin disease that disrupts the skin barrier, such as scabies or eczema). Impetigo is also classified as bullous or non-bullous impetigo. Bullous impetigo simply means that the skin eruption is characterised by bullae (blisters). The term 'impetigo contagiosa' is sometimes used to mean non-bullous impetigo, and at other times it is used as a synonym for all impetigo.</P>
<P>Non-bullous impetigo is the most common form of impetigo. The initial lesion is a thin-walled vesicle on previously normal skin that rapidly ruptures. It then leaves superficial erosion covered with yellowish-brown or honey-coloured crusts. The crusts eventually dry, separate, and disappear, leaving a red mark that heals without scarring. The most frequently affected areas are the face and limbs. The lesions are sometimes painful. Usually, there are no systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, or anorexia. Swelling of the lymph nodes draining the infected area of skin is common. It is believed that, in most cases, spontaneous resolution may be expected within two to three weeks without treatment but more prompt resolution occurs with adequate treatment. Diagnostic confusion can occur with a variety of skin disorders including shingles, cold sores, cutaneous fungal infections, and eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnick 2000</LINK>). Pyoderma is sometimes used as a synonym for impetigo in tropical countries. This is usually to denote streptococcal, as opposed to staphylococcal, impetigo.<BR/>
<BR/>Bullous impetigo is characterised by larger bullae or blisters that rupture less readily and can persist for several days. Usually there are fewer lesions and the trunk is affected more frequently than in non-bullous impetigo. Diagnostic confusion can occur with thermal burns, blistering disorders (e.g. bullous pemphigoid), and Stevens Johnson syndrome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</I> is considered to be the main bacterium that causes non-bullous impetigo. However, <I>Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes),</I> or both <I>S. pyogenes</I> and <I>S. aureus,</I> are sometimes isolated from the skin. In moderate climates, staphylococcal impetigo is more common, whereas in warmer and more humid climates, the streptococcal form predominates. In moderate climates, the relative frequency of <I>S. aureus </I>infections has also changed with time (<LINK REF="REF-Dagan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagan 1993</LINK>). It was predominant in the 1940s and 1950s, after which Group A streptococci became more prevalent. In the past two decades, <I>S. aureus </I>has become more common again. Bullous impetigo is always caused by <I>S. aureus</I>.</P>
<P>Secondary impetigo may occur as a complication of many dermatological conditions (notably eczema). The eruption appears clinically similar to non-bullous impetigo. Usually <I>S. aureus </I>is involved. The underlying skin disease may improve with successful treatment of the impetigo, and the converse may also be true.</P>
<P>Complications of non-bullous impetigo are rare, but local and systemic spread of infection can occur that may result in cellulitis, lymphangitis, or septicaemia. Non-infectious complications of <I>S. pyogenes</I> infection include guttate psoriasis, scarlet fever, and glomerulonephritis (an inflammation of the kidney that can lead to kidney failure). It is thought that most cases of glomerulonephritis result from streptococcal impetigo rather than streptococcal throat infection, and this has always been an important rationale for antibiotic treatment. The incidence of acute glomerulonephritis has declined rapidly over the last few decades. <LINK REF="REF-Baltimore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baltimore 1985</LINK> stated that the risk of developing glomerulonephritis is not altered by treatment of impetigo; however, certain subtypes of Group A streptococci are associated with a much greater risk (<LINK REF="REF-Dillon-1979b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dillon 1979b</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the Netherlands, most people with impetigo consult their general practitioner and only approximately 1% of the cases are referred to a dermatologist (<LINK REF="REF-Bruijnzeels-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruijnzeels 1993</LINK>). Although the incidence of impetigo in general practice has been declining, recent data show an increase in consultations for impetigo (<LINK REF="REF-Koning-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koning 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Bosch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Bosch 2007</LINK>). Impetigo is still a common disease particularly in young children. It is the third most common skin disorder in children after dermatitis/eczema and viral warts (<LINK REF="REF-Bruijnzeels-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruijnzeels 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dagan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohammedamin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohammedamin 2006</LINK>). Impetigo is the most common skin infection that is presented in general practice by children aged one to four years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Mohammedamin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohammedamin 2006</LINK>). In British general practice, 2.8% of children aged 0 to 4 and 1.6% aged 5 to 15 consult their GP about impetigo each year (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1995</LINK>). In the Netherlands in the late 1980s, the consultation rate was 1.7% of all children under 18 years of age; this increased to 2.1% in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Koning-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koning 2006</LINK>). Peak incidence occurs between the ages of one and eight years (<LINK REF="REF-Koning-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koning 2006</LINK>). In some tropical or developing countries the incidence of impetigo seems to be higher than elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Canizares-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canizares 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kristensen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristensen 1991</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-17 07:35:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Management options for impetigo include the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>no pharmacological treatment, waiting for natural resolution, hygiene measures;</LI>
<LI>topical disinfectants (such as saline, hexachlorophene, povidone iodine, and chlorhexidine);</LI>
<LI>topical antibiotics (such as neomycin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, gentamycin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, retapamulin, or topical steroid/antibiotic combination); and</LI>
<LI>systemic antibiotics (such as penicillin, (flu)cloxacillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, erythromycin, and cephalexin).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The aim of treatment includes resolving the soreness caused by lesions and the disease's unsightly appearance (especially on the face), as well as preventing recurrence and spread to other people. An ideal treatment should be effective, cheap, easy to use, and accepted by people. It should be free from side-effects, and it should not contribute to bacterial resistance. For this reason, antibiotics should not have an unnecessarily broad spectrum (<LINK REF="REF-Espersen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espersen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 1999</LINK>), and if a topical antibiotic is used, it should, preferably, not be one which may be needed for systemic use (<LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Waiting for natural resolution could be acceptable if the natural history were known and benign. Impetigo is considered to be self-limiting by many authors (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnick 2000</LINK>). However, there are no robust data on the natural history of impetigo. Reported cure rates of placebo creams vary from 8% to 42% at 7 to 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Eells-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eells 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruby-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Ruby 1973</LINK>). Topical cleansing used to be advised in the 1970s as an alternative for antibiotic treatment, but this was later said to be no more effective than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Dagan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dagan 1992</LINK>). Guidelines and treatment advice often do not mention topical cleansing as a treatment because the main concern is preventing the spread of the infection to other children.</P>
<P>A choice has to be made between topical and systemic antibiotic treatment, although in some situations clinicians prescribe both topical and systemic antibiotics. An advantage of the use of topical antibiotics is that the drug can be applied where it is needed, avoiding systemic side-effects such as gastrointestinal upset. Also, compliance may be better (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The disadvantages of using topical antibiotics include the risks of developing bacterial resistance and sensitisation, e.g. developing an allergic contact dermatitis to one of the constituents of the topical preparation (<LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 1999</LINK>). This is especially common with the older antibiotics, such as gentamycin, bacitracin, and neomycin (<LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 1999</LINK>). Some preparations (e.g. tetracycline) can cause staining of the skin and clothes.</P>
<P>Staphylococcal resistance against penicillin and erythromycin is common (<LINK REF="STD-Dagan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dagan 1992</LINK>). Bacterial resistance against the newer topical antibiotics, such as mupirocin ointment and fusidic acid ointment, is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Alsterholm-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsterholm 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Neeling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Neeling 1998</LINK>). Another advantage of the newer topical antibiotics is that mupirocin is never, and fusidic acid not often, used systemically.</P>

<P>Two authors (JCvdW and SK or RvdS) independently read all abstracts or citations of trials. If one of the authors thought the article might be relevant, a full copy of the article was acquired for further data collection. The reasons for exclusion were recorded for every excluded abstract or citation. Only full reports were included. Two authors independently screened all full-copy articles (LvSS, SK, RvdS, JCvdW). The articles were selected according to the inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion were recorded on a specially-designed registration form (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table). In the case of doubt, the opinion of a third author was obtained. Many trials studied a range of (skin) infections including impetigo. Frequently, the results of the subgroup of impetigo participants were not reported separately. In these studies, provided they were published in the last 10 years, we contacted trial authors and asked them to provide the results of the subgroup of impetigo participants. We obtained data in this way in only two instances (<LINK REF="STD-Blaszcyk--1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blaszcyk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Claudy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Claudy 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2011-09-18 22:59:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the first version of the review we included 56 papers describing 57 trials. This update identified 12 additional studies, of which 2 were published before 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-Farah-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Farah 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishii-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ishii 1977</LINK>). One study, which was previously included, was excluded because it turned out not to be a randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Park-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Park 1993</LINK>), bringing the total number of included studies to 68. The lists of ongoing studies (<LINK TAG="ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Ongoing studies</LINK>) and studies awaiting assessment (<LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>) show studies that might be eligible for a future update of this review. Regarding the excluded studies, we only report on the most relevant ones (<LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most trials were reported in the English language. Four included studies were reported in Japanese, and one paper each was reported in Thai, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Danish (some of these had abstracts and tables in English). Trials in Russian, Chinese, German, and French were among those that were excluded (not for language reasons). In instances where none of the authors were competent in the language of the paper, translators provided assistance.</P>
<P>We found an appreciable number of studies from the early 1940s (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-MacKenna-1945" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenna 1945</LINK>). These studies were often carried out in military populations, in which impetigo was a frequent disease at the time. These study reports did not meet the inclusion criteria of our review because of inadequate randomisation. The distribution of the included studies by decade is as follows: 1960s - 1 study, 1970s - 5 studies (7%), 1980s - 31 studies (46%), 1990s - 20 studies (29%), and 2000 to 2008 - 11 studies (16%). Five included studies evaluating mupirocin were presented at an international symposium in 1984; we found no publication other than the conference proceedings for three of these (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wainscott-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wainscott 1985</LINK>).

<P>All studies were parallel group trials, but there were important design differences between the studies. As mentioned before, many trials included participants with infections other than impetigo, while some trials studied only impetigo. Ages of included participants differed widely, as some studies were carried out exclusively in either adults or children. The average age of study participants in trials that studied a range of skin infections was usually higher than in studies focusing on impetigo alone. With the exception of four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Faye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Faye 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishii-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ishii 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vainer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vainer 1986</LINK>), all studies performed bacteriological investigations. Although a number of studies explicitly stated that participants with a negative culture were excluded, other studies may also have excluded culture negative participants without reporting those exclusions. No study reported a predominantly streptococcal impetigo. The only studies not to report a preponderance of staphylococcal impetigo were <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ruby-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Ruby 1973</LINK> (carried out in Puerto Rico and Texas respectively).</P>

Thirty-nine trials studied impetigo alone whereas 29 trials studied participants with a range of (usually skin) infections, impetigo being 1 of them.

This type of study design imposed problems in retrieving outcome data as the outcomes were often presented for all the participants together. We included these studies only if the main outcome measure was presented separately for the subgroup of impetigo participants.</P>

<P>The 68 trials evaluated 50 different treatments (26 oral treatments and 24 topical treatments - both including placebo). The systemic treatments that were studied were all administered orally (tablets). A total of 74 different comparisons were made. Some comparisons were made in several studies; some studies made more than one comparison. Sixty-eight comparisons were made only once. Six different comparisons were made in more than 1 trial, especially when topical mupirocin was studied (topical mupirocin versus oral erythromycin was considered in 10 studies, mupirocin versus fusidic acid was considered in 4 studies, mupirocin versus placebo was considered in 3 studies). For each of these comparisons we pooled the outcomes of the different studies (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common type of comparison was between 2 different oral antibiotic treatments (29 studies including duplicates). Cephalosporins (15 studies) and macrolide antibiotics, especially erythromycin and azithromycin (9 studies), were most often involved. A topical antibiotic treatment was compared with an oral antibiotic treatment in 22 studies. Nineteen of these comparisons contained erythromycin, mupirocin, or both.</P>
<P>Only two trials studied antiseptic or disinfecting treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruby-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Ruby 1973</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Cure as assessed by investigator was our main outcome measure. This was often not defined. Researchers sometimes combined the categories 'cured' and 'improved' and presented those participants as one group. The length of follow-up varied widely, and it was sometimes not even specified; however, we tried to retrieve the data for follow up as close as possible to seven days after the start of treatment. The development of bacterial resistance to the study drug was reported in only 10 studies.</P>

<P>Overall, topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than topical placebo. No differences were found between the two most studied topical antibiotics: mupirocin and fusidic acid. Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin. In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin V was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin, and there is a lack of evidence to suggest that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The reported number of side-effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side-effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment. A striking finding is that the trials comparing erythromycin with mupirocin recorded more (gastrointestinal) side-effects in the erythromycin group than the trials that compared erythromycin with other oral antibiotics.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The large number of treatments evaluated (50) supports the view that there is no widely accepted standard therapy for impetigo. Most studies did not contribute clear answers about the vast choice of treatment options. Many of the studies were underpowered; this is partly due to the fact that many trials included several skin infections, impetigo being only one of them (these studies are directed at the drug rather than at the disease). In many cases, significant differences became insignificant when impetigo participants were considered after excluding participants with other sorts of infection. Another drawback of this type of study is that the age of participants is much higher than the typical age at which people contract impetigo (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Blaszcyk--1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blaszcyk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bucko-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Bucko 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bucko-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Bucko 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiani-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kiani 1991</LINK>). The dosage of studied antibiotics may differ between studies, complicating the comparability of studies; however, the same doses were usually used (e.g. erythromycin 40 mg/kg/day). Cure rates of specific treatments can be different between studies, e.g. of fusidic acid and mupirocin (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1989" TYPE="STUDY">White 1989</LINK>). This may be explained by the fact that investigations were done in different regions and times, and inclusion criteria differed.</P>
<P>Little is known about the 'natural history' of impetigo. Therefore, the paucity of placebo-controlled trials is striking, given that impetigo can be considered a minor disease. Only seven placebo-controlled studies have been conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Eells-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eells 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gould-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gould 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishii-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ishii 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koning-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koning 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koning-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Koning 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruby-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Ruby 1973</LINK>). The 7-day cure rates of placebo groups in these studies varied but can be considerable (0% to 42%).</P>
<P>The disinfectant agents, such as povidone iodine and chlorhexidine, recommended in some guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnick 2000</LINK>), usually as supplementary treatment, have been inadequately studied and not compared to placebo treatment. Hydrogen peroxide cream was not significantly less effective than fusidic acid (cure rate 72% versus 82%) in a relatively large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1994</LINK>). We judged that blinding in this trial was inadequate.<BR/>
</P>
<P>There is a commonly accepted idea that more serious forms of impetigo (e.g. participants with extensive lesions, general illness, fever) need oral rather than topical antibiotic treatment. This principle cannot be evaluated using the data included in our review as trials that study local treatments usually exclude participants with more serious forms of impetigo.</P>
<P>One of our primary outcomes was relief of symptoms, such as pain, itching, and soreness, as assessed by participants (or parents). Surprisingly, only one of the studies addressed this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Giordano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giordano 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Resistance patterns of staphylococci - which causes impetigo - change over time. Outcomes of studies dating back more than 10 years, which form the majority of trials in this review, may not be applicable to the current prevalence of infecting agents. Also, resistance between regions and countries may vary considerably. Thus, up-to-date, local characteristics and resistance patterns of the causative bacteria should always be taken into account when choosing antibiotic treatment. In addition, health authorities and other relevant bodies may advise against prescribing certain antibiotics for impetigo, in order to restrict the development of bacterial resistance and reserve these drugs for more serious infections.</P>

<P>Although the total number of randomised trials we identified was considerable, the average number of participants per study was small. In this update, the newly added studies made this average increase from 62 to 84 per study. This was partly due to studies that assessed a range of infections and randomised a large number of participants, but in which those with impetigo were only a minority. Through the years, we found an increase in the quality of the studies; the average number of items scored positively increased from less than three in the 1970s to almost five for studies published in the new millennium. This is a problem shared with many other reviews. Details of the design of the studies were often lacking in the published reports, leading to a lot of question marks in the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>

<P>Several studies included participants with impetigo next to participants with other conditions, but they did not report results of those with impetigo separately.

<P>Topical mupirocin and fusidic acid can be considered as effective as, or more effective than, oral antibiotics, and these topical agents have fewer side-effects. This finding is in sharp contrast to the previously held view that oral treatment is superior to topical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Baltimore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baltimore 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tack-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tack 1998</LINK>). Other topical antibiotics, excluding retapamulin, were generally inferior to mupirocin, fusidic acid, and oral antibiotics. The study by Vainer is an exception: no difference was seen between tetracycline/bacitracin cream, neomycin/bacitracin cream, and fusidic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Vainer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vainer 1986</LINK>). Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin are the only topical antibiotics that have been compared to placebo (and shown to be more effective).</P>
<P>For the results of the study comparing topical fusidic acid to retapamulin (<LINK REF="STD-Oranje-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oranje 2007</LINK>), the P value computed by Review Manager (RevMan) differs from the study report (0.07 in RevMan vs 0.062 in the study report) due to different methods (94.8% vs 90.1% cure, favouring retapamulin).</P>
<P>None of the studies reported cases of acute (post-streptococcal) glomerulonephritis. This complication has always been an important rationale for oral antibiotic treatment. This reported absence of glomerulonephritis may reflect the reduced importance of streptococci in impetigo. It should be noted that study sizes are small and glomerulonephritis is rare.</P>
<P>Several of the interventions used for impetigo have also been applied in other situations where <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, the main bacterium causing impetigo, plays a role. Here we review some of these, as reported in recently published Cochrane reviews. The effect of mupirocin ointment for preventing <I>S. aureus</I> infections in nasal carriers was superior to that of placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijen 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Birnie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnie 2008</LINK> assessed interventions to reduce <I>S. aureus</I> in the management of atopic eczema, but the review did not find clear evidence of benefit for any of these.

<P>There is a lack of evidence from RCTs for the value of disinfecting measures in the treatment of impetigo, as a sole or supplementary treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for topical antibiotics in clinical practice</HEADING>
<P>There is good evidence that the topical antibiotics mupirocin and fusidic acid are equal to, or possibly more effective than, oral treatment for people with limited disease. Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin are probably equally effective; other topical antibiotics seem less effective. In general, oral antibiotics have more side-effects than topical antibiotics, especially gastrointestinal side-effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for use of systemic antibiotics in clinical practice</HEADING>
<P>What is stated in the previous paragraph regarding the comparison with topical antibiotics is equally relevant here. The only oral antibiotic that has been compared to placebo is penicillin, and this was in an old study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruby-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Ruby 1973</LINK>): no difference was found, and the confidence interval was large. Based on the available evidence on efficacy, no clear preference can be given for B-lactamase resistant narrow-spectrum penicillins such as cloxacillin, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin, or for broad spectrum penicillins such as ampicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, cephalosporins or macrolides.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General considerations regarding the choice of antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>Other criteria, such as price, (unnecessary) broadness of spectrum, and wish to reserve a particular antibiotic for specific conditions, can be decisive. Resistance rates against erythromycin seem to be rising. In general, oral antibiotics have more side-effects, especially gastrointestinal ones. There is insufficient evidence to say whether oral antibiotics are better than topicals for more serious and extensive forms of impetigo. From a practical standpoint, oral antibiotics might be an easier option for people with very extensive impetigo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-19 00:04:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials should be powered to compare treatments for a specific disease entity, rather than the effectiveness of a specific antibiotic on a variety of (skin) infections, as treatment may impact differently on separate subtypes of skin and soft tissue infections. As seen in this review, trials that study one treatment for several diseases often show inconclusive results for specific diagnoses. Future research on impetigo should make a careful power calculation as most included studies included too few participants with impetigo to meaningfully assess differences in treatment effect.</P>
<P>Establishing the natural course of impetigo without any form of antibiotic treatment would be useful. However, although impetigo can be considered a minor ailment, studies with a non-intervention arm seem ethically impracticable. Comparator treatments may include the best identified options for non-antibiotic management.</P>
<P>The relative absence of data on the efficacy of topical disinfectants is a research gap that needs to be filled. These agents may not contribute to antibiotic resistance, and they are cheap. This research may be of particular importance for developing countries.</P>
<P>Preferably, a trial on impetigo should:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>not include participants with a variety of skin diseases and soft tissue infections. If it does, results should be presented separately by diagnosis;</LI>
<LI>focus on either bullous or non-bullous impetigo and on either primary or secondary impetigo;</LI>
<LI>report resistance rates of causative bacteria against the studied antibiotic and against reference antibiotics such as erythromycin, mupirocin and/or fusidic acid, at baseline and at follow-up;</LI>
<LI>use clear and objective outcome measures for cure and improvement of impetigo, instead of subjective judgements such as 'improved', 'satisfactory', and 'good response'. Key elements defining clinical cure could be absence of crusts, dryness, intactness, and absence of redness of skin. A parameter of improvement could be 'size of affected surface'. Choosing 'standard' follow-up periods, e.g. 7, 14, or 21 days, will facilitate the comparison of studies; and</LI>
<LI>include a placebo group, or at least a 'gold standard' reference group. For topical treatments, mupirocin or fusidic acid could be considered 'gold standard'.</LI>
</UL>
<P>As part of the issue of antibiotic resistance, impetigo studies that establish the contribution of the studied treatment to the development of bacterial resistance are desirable.</P>

<P>In case of studies assessing cure at more than one point in time, the protocol did not specify what time point to select for data extraction. From the start of the review, we chose the assessment that was closest to one week from the start of treatment.</P>
<P>For this update, the scoring of methodological quality was changed into the newly recommended 'Risk of bias' table (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).We also used risk ratio as recommended by the Cochrane Skin Group.</P>
