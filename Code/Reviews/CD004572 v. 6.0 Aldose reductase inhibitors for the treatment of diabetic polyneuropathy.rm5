<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-11-03 15:13:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Aldose reductase inhibitors for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Polyneuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus that causes pain and sensory and motor deficits in the arms and legs. It can also lead to foot ulcers and amputation. Aldose reductase inhibitors are a class of medications that block the breakdown of glucose by a specific metabolic pathway called the polyol pathway, and may potentially slow or reverse progression of neuropathy. The authors reviewed the results of all randomized trials that compared an aldose reductase inhibitor with a control and lasted at least six months. Many of the 32 randomized controlled trials identified had significant methodological flaws. The trials used a variety of measures to look for a benefit of treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors. The authors elected to focus primarily on changes in muscle strength and sensation. These were chosen because they are thought be the best indicator of the severity of polyneuropathy, and they have been used in a previous landmark study of the effects of intensive blood sugar control on diabetic neuropathy, as well as in studies of treatments in other types of polyneuropathy. Muscle strength or sensation were assessed in 29 trials, but sufficient data for analysis was only available in 13 studies, involving 879 treated participants and 906 controls. There was no overall significant difference between the treated and control groups. For one drug, tolrestat, there was possibly some benefit, but concerns about liver toxicity have lead to withdrawal of tolrestat from use in humans. A few trials did report that symptoms of neuropathy improved for the treated group, but this was contradicted by most other trials. No benefit was detected on electromyography (EMG) parameters (27 studies) or foot ulceration (one study). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the studies. Adverse effects were infrequent and were mostly minor, except for severe allergic reactions with sorbinil, impaired kidney function with zenarestat, and alteration of liver function with tolrestat. The authors concluded that there was no significant benefit of treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors for diabetic polyneuropathy. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Polyneuropathy, a common complication of diabetes mellitus, causes pain and sensory and motor deficits in the limbs, and is also an important independent predictor of foot ulceration. Inhibiting the metabolism of glucose by the polyol pathway using aldose reductase inhibitors is a potential mechanism to slow or reverse the neuropathy's progression. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of aldose reductase inhibitors on the progression of symptoms, signs or functional disability in diabetic polyneuropathy. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (from January 1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (from January 1980 to May 2007) and LILACS (from 1982 to May 2007). We reviewed bibliographies of randomized trials identified, and contacted authors and experts in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized controlled trials comparing an aldose reductase inhibitor with control, and lasting at least six months. <BR/>The primary outcome measure was change in neurological function, measured in various ways, including strength testing, sensory examination, and composite scores of neurological examination. Secondary outcome measures were nerve conduction studies, neuropathic symptoms, quality of life, occurrence of foot ulcers and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials included in the review were selected and assessed independently by at least two of us. Methodological criteria and study results were recorded on data extraction forms.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-two randomized controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Many had significant methodological flaws. Change in neurological function, our primary outcome measure, was assessed in 29 trials, but sufficient data for meta-analysis were only available in 13 studies, involving 879 treated participants and 909 controls. There was no overall significant difference between the treated and control groups (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.05), although one subgroup analysis (four trials using tolrestat) favored treatment. A benefit for neuropathic symptoms was suggested by a group of trials using a dichotomized endpoint (improvement or not), but this was contradicted by another group of trials which measured symptoms on a continuous scale. There was no overall benefit on nerve conduction parameters (27 studies) or foot ulceration (one study). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the studies. While most adverse events were infrequent and minor, three compounds had dose limiting adverse events that lead to their withdrawal from human use: severe hypersensitivity reactions with sorbinil, elevation of creatinine with zenarestat, and alteration of liver function with tolrestat.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found no statistically significant difference between aldose reductase inhibitors and placebo in the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. Any future clinical trials of aldose reductase inhibitors should be restricted to compounds proven to have substantial biological or preclinical advantages over previously tested agents. <BR/> </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-28 20:42:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycemia (elevated levels of blood glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in the Cochrane Library (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in The Cochrane Library. </P>
<P>Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Estimates of the prevalence of neuropathy in people with diabetes range from 10 to 50%, depending on factors such as how neuropathy is defined, methods of detection, and the population studied. A recent review estimates that neuropathy is present in about 30% of people attending hospital diabetes clinics, 20% of people with diabetes in primary care settings and 10% of the entire population of patients with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The symptoms and signs of diabetic polyneuropathy mainly involve the feet and hands and are approximately symmetrical. Sensory loss and paresthesiae (often painful) are predominant, while muscle weakness is mild in most people. In addition to disability related to pain and the sensory and motor deficits, polyneuropathy is an important independent predictor of foot ulceration in people with diabetes. The annual incidence of foot ulcers in all people with diabetes is about 1%, but in those with established sensory loss from neuropathy, the incidence is seven times higher (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 1998</LINK>). Non-healing foot ulcers precede the large majority of amputations in people with diabetes, and diabetic polyneuropathy is associated with a 2-to-25-fold increase in the risk of amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayfield 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Longitudinal studies of people with diabetic polyneuropathy have demonstrated that their clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities worsen with time, although slowly. For example, in the population-based Rochester Diabetic Neuropathy Study, participants were assessed with the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), in which the minimum detectable meaningful change is two points. In this patient cohort, those who were followed for at least two years worsened at a rate of only 0.85 NIS points per year (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1997</LINK>). Thus, it is likely that it would require many months or several years of observation to demonstrate that a treatment slows or prevents worsening in diabetic neuropathy. Strategies to treat diabetic neuropathy include optimal glycemic control, management of associated risk factors, symptomatic therapies and treatments based on pathogenic mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy has been the subject of much study and discussion, and there is not universal agreement about its cause. Electrophysiological and nerve biopsy data suggest that the major pathological process is axonal degeneration, though there is evidence of secondary demyelination as well. Potential mechanisms of pathogenesis include an ischemic process secondary to microangiopathy, analogous to diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1989</LINK>), glycosylation of structural proteins consequent to chronic hyperglycemia, or injury by reactive oxygen species generated by altered glucose metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Leinninger-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leinninger 2006</LINK>). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and may coexist and interact in many or most people with diabetic polyneuropathy. </P>
<P>Chronic hyperglycemia is hypothesized to exert its effects on peripheral nerves by both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Oates-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 2002</LINK>). The extracellular route comprises various types of glycation reaction, including direct glycosylation of structural proteins, as well as chemical rearrangements resulting in the production of advanced glycosylation end products (AGE). The intracellular route results from increased flux of glucose through the polyol pathway (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1997</LINK>). The polyol pathway is a sequence of intracellular chemical reactions, and is a mechanism by which cells can produce fructose from glucose. The main interest in the pathway has been its potential role in the development of complications, particularly neuropathy, in people with diabetes. The polyol pathway has two steps, each energy-dependent and enzymatically catalyzed. In the first step, which is catalyzed by aldose reductase, glucose is converted to sorbitol, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is oxidized (i.e. NADPH is converted to NADP). The second step, catalyzed by sorbitol dehydrogenase, converts sorbitol to fructose, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is reduced (i.e. NAD is reduced to NADH). Chronic hyperglycemia results in increased activity of the polyol pathway, with several potentially deleterious consequences: (1) a decrease in cellular NADPH levels, resulting in decreased concentrations of glutathione (a free radical scavenger) and nitric oxide (a vasodilator); (2) increased cellular sorbitol levels, leading to decreased levels of myo-inositol (necessary for Na-K ATPase function); and (3) increased fructose levels, which enhance formation of AGEs (fructose is ten-fold more active than glucose in glycosylation reactions).</P>
<P>Suppressing the metabolism of glucose via the polyol pathway by inhibiting aldose reductase is a potential way to prevent the putative deleterious consequences noted above. A great deal of research effort in the last two decades has been expended to test the effects of drugs which inhibit aldose reductase on human diabetic polyneuropathy. However, a meta-analysis of controlled trials of aldose reductase inhibitors published between 1981 and 1993 concluded that it was not possible to make a clear statement about the efficacy of these compounds on diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolucci-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolucci 1996</LINK>). After this meta-analysis was first published as a Cochrane Review in The Cochrane Library, several concerns were raised about its methodology (inclusion of short duration trials, use of a surrogate measure of neuropathy severity (nerve conduction studies) as the primary outcome measure). As the concerns were not addressed and the Review was not updated, it was subsequently withdrawn from the Cochrane Library.</P>
<P>Several factors appear to have contributed to the uncertain status of aldose reductase inhibitors, including problems of trial design and types of outcome measures employed, in addition to serious adverse effects for some compounds. For example, tolrestat was approved for clinical use in several countries, but was subsequently withdrawn from most markets worldwide in 1996 following reports of fatal hepatic necrosis. Two other compounds did not progress beyond clinical trials because of serious adverse effects: sorbinil (lymphadenopathy, rash, fever, pancytopenia) and zenerastat (impaired renal function). One aldose reductase inhibitor, epalrestat, is approved for clinical use in Japan, but none of the other aldose reductase inhibitors are being used outside clinical trials. <BR/> <BR/>Treatments that could prevent, improve, or even slow the progression of diabetic polyneuropathy would result in important improvements in the quality of life for many people with diabetes mellitus. Despite a wealth of experimental data that implicate the polyol pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy, and over 20 years of clinical trials of aldose reductase inhibitors, the clinical efficacy of these compounds is unclear. The goal of this review was to assess whether there is now sufficient evidence to support the use of aldose reductase inhibitors in clinical practice. </P>

<P>The primary outcome measure was defined as change in neurological status after a treatment period of at least six months, as measured by an evaluation of neurological function. This type of outcome measure is clinically relevant and was used to detect alterations in the progression of diabetic neuropathy in a landmark study of the effects of intensive glycemic control on diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-DCCTRG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCTRG 1993</LINK>). Evaluation of neurological function may be measured in various ways, including strength testing, sensory examination (quantitative and non-quantitative) and composite scores of neurological examination. In order to compare studies which used different scales to measure neurological function we treated a standardized unit change in one neurological scale as equivalent to a standardized unit change in another neurological scale, and compared proportional changes in these scales with and without use of an aldose reductase inhibitor. Unit change was defined as a standard deviation for that measurement scale as implemented in the RevMan standardized mean difference facility.</P>

<P>Only randomized clinical trials of at least six months duration were selected for review. Each study was reviewed by two of the review authors to evaluate characteristics of methodological quality (we followed the same division of studies according to first author as described above in Selection of studies).

Each characteristic was graded as adequate, unclear, inadequate or not done. Differences in grading by the review authors were discussed and resolved by consensus by all three authors. When the quality of a characteristic was unclear, a letter of inquiry was sent to the lead author of the study for clarification. This classification of methodological quality was used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we explored the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-10-28 20:33:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome measure, change in neurological examination, was measured in several ways (see Results). Several secondary outcome measures, some of which were surrogate measures of nerve function, were also analyzed. For continuous data measured in a similar way, we calculated the weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals. Where the outcome measure or data measurement differed between studies we calculated the standardized mean differences (SMD).</P>
<P>It was anticipated that adverse effects for the different aldose reductase inhibitors would vary and might be compound-specific. Therefore, to capture variable types of adverse effects we recorded all adverse effects reported in the analyzed studies and tabulated these separately for each of the included compounds.

<P>Heterogeneity was explored by statistical testing (to look for variability in effect sizes between studies), qualitative review of the confidence intervals for the results of each study and careful review of the design of each study. We considered heterogeneity to be present if statistically significant variation in effect sizes above that consistent with the within-studies variation existed between the studies. The I-squared statistic measures the variability in studies not attributable to chance. I-squared values from 75% to 100% were regarded as representing high levels of heterogeneity. We also considered heterogeneity to be present if the confidence intervals for the results of each study did not overlap, or if, in our opinion, the studies differed greatly in their design (type of compound studied, length of study, and quality of study). Outcome variables were analyzed using a random-effects model if heterogeneity was detected, and with a fixed-effects model if there was not significant heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was present and appeared to be attributable to one or more studies, analyses were repeated omitting these studies.</P>

<P>The included studies were all randomized parallel group designs, except for one crossover study (<LINK REF="STD-Martyn-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Martyn 1987</LINK>). Most studies lasted six to 12 months (range 24 weeks to three years), and most involved comparison of an ARI with placebo. In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 2001</LINK>), control subjects received only usual care without a placebo.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All studies recruited participants 18 years and older. The 32 studies involved a total of 4970 participants, of whom 2922 received an ARI. Type 2 diabetics were preponderant, although diagnostic criteria for diabetes were not explicitly stated in most studies. Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy, and the severity of the neuropathy, varied considerably from study to study. In most studies there was a reasonable attempt to exclude other causes of neuropathy, although the possibility of inherited neuropathy was considered only in a minority of studies. Overall, the intervention and control participants were comparable at baseline, except in two small studies in which neuropathy at baseline seemed to be more severe in the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Guy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jennings-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jennings 1990</LINK>), and one with a relative excess of female participants in the ARI group (<LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1991</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our primary outcome measure, change in neurological examination, was an endpoint in 29 studies.

Among our secondary outcome measures, nerve conduction studies were used in 27 studies, neurological symptoms in 21, and the development of foot ulcers in one (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hare-1988" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hare 1988</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Change in neurological examination</HEADING>
<P>Change in the neurological examination was an outcome measure in 29 studies. This most frequently involved the measurement of vibration perception threshold. Other measurements included the use of an "overall assessment score" (<LINK REF="STD-Sima-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sima 1988</LINK>), measurement of thermal threshold (<LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1991</LINK>) or cool thermal sensation (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>), measurement of light touch and pain sensation (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2006</LINK>), and measurement of tendon reflexes or muscle power (<LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no data or insufficient data for analysis in 15 studies involving approximately 770 treated participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bertelsmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bertelsmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dietrich-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dietrich 1990</LINK> (exact number of participants unclear); <LINK REF="STD-Fagius-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fagius 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jennings-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jennings 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jespersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jespersen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krentz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Krentz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyn-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Martyn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hare-1988" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hare 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SRG-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SRG 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Gerven-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Gerven 1992</LINK>). Of these studies, one reported a statistically significant difference between the treated and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-van-Gerven-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Gerven 1992</LINK>), and several others reported no significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Fagius-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fagius 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jespersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jespersen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyn-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Martyn 1987</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2006</LINK>) reported change in neurological signs only as a dichotomous outcome (2/62 treated participants versus 9/72 untreated participants developed signs of diabetic neuropathy, a statistically significant difference), so that these data could not be included in the meta-analysis based on continuous data.</P>
<P>Thirteen studies, involving 879 treated participants and 909 controls, reported sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florkowski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Florkowski 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macleod-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macleod 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundkvist-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sundkvist 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1991</LINK>). As the heterogeneity of these studies was significant, we used a random effects approach. There was no significant difference between the treated and control groups (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.05) (see Analysis 01.01). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>) reported results for both vibration sensation and cool thermal sensation. Analysis using either of these outcomes produced almost identical results; Analysis 01.01 used the vibration data. Another study reported a statistically significant improvement favoring treatment for elements of the neurological exam, including tendon reflexes and muscle power that were rated on a three point scale (<LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>). However, raw data could not be obtained so only the data for vibration perception threshold from this study were included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Analysis for each ARI separately also showed no difference between treated and control groups, with the exception of tolrestat, where there was a statistically significant benefit (WMD -4.15, 95% CI -7.43 to -0.87) based on 175 treated participants and 163 controls (<LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macleod-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macleod 1992</LINK>) (see Analysis 01.02). If the tolrestat study that was not placebo-controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>) is excluded from the analysis, the WMD favours tolrestat, but the 95% CI spans zero (see Analysis 01.03). In Analysis 01.01, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1995</LINK>) appears to be an outlier. This trial, which used tolrestat, enrolled participants with a shorter duration of diabetes mellitus than most trials. A subgroup analysis including trials with duration of diabetes less than six years suggested a small statistically significant benefit (SMD -1.33, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.27), but the number of treated participants is only 79 (see Analysis 01.04).</P>
<P>Several sensitivity analyses did not change the results (excluding (1) studies using ponalrestat (which was subsequently found to not enter peripheral nerve and therefore would not be expected to show any benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Hamada-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamada 2004</LINK>)), (2) poor quality studies (those with any inadequate or more than 2 unclear quality items - see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), and (3) studies of less than one year duration).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nerve conduction studies</HEADING>
<P>Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed as an outcome measure in 27 studies. The nerves evaluated were variable. The NCS measures that were assessed for meta-analysis were changes in peroneal motor conduction velocity, peroneal compound muscle action potential amplitude, and sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude. Data were not gathered for these specific variables in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2006</LINK>). Tibial conduction velocity data was reported in some studies that did not have peroneal conduction velocity data (<LINK REF="STD-Fagius-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fagius 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florkowski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Florkowski 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 2001</LINK>). An analysis of the combined peroneal and tibial conduction velocity data was performed. Continuous data were available for the majority of studies that reported data for these NCS variables. Some studies stated whether there was a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups, but reported either no data or insufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Guy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guy 1988</LINK> - not significant (ns), <LINK REF="STD-Dietrich-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dietrich 1990</LINK> - ns, <LINK REF="STD-Jespersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jespersen 1986</LINK> - ns, <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1989</LINK> - significant in favour of treatment, <LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1989</LINK> - significant in favour of control). Several other studies were excluded from the pooled analysis because incomplete data were reported: motor nerve studied was not stated (<LINK REF="STD-van-Gerven-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Gerven 1992</LINK>), ranges of values without standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Jennings-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jennings 1990</LINK>), least squares means without standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Krentz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Krentz 1992</LINK>), only percentage of participants improved, unchanged and worsened (<LINK REF="STD-Daniele-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Daniele 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Lower extremity motor conduction velocity data were reported in 17 studies, involving 1074 treated participants and 992 controls. A total of 13 studies, involving 938 treated participants and 845 controls, reported sufficient peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity data for meta-analysis. As the heterogeneity of these studies was significant, we used a random-effects approach. Standardized mean differences were used, as one study (<LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1989</LINK>) reported only percentage change from onset. Treatment was associated with a slightly worse SMD in change in peroneal motor conduction velocity (-0.02 m/s) but the 95% CI was -0.29 to 0.25 (Analysis 02.01). Including data from the four studies which reported tibial motor nerve conduction velocity (<LINK REF="STD-Fagius-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fagius 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florkowski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Florkowski 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 2001</LINK>) produced a SMD marginally favoring treatment, but the 95% CI spanned zero (SMD 0.09 m/s, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.31) (see Analysis 02.02).</P>
<P>Peroneal nerve compound muscle action potential amplitude data were available from 3 studies involving 298 treated participants and 209 controls (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SRG-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SRG 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundkvist-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sundkvist 1992</LINK>). The difference between groups was not significant (WMD 0.03 mV, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.42) (see Analysis 02.03).</P>
<P>Sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude data was available from 6 studies, involving 570 treated participants and 496 controls (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyn-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Martyn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Salmon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sima-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sima 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sundkvist-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sundkvist 1992</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neuropathic symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Many of the included studies that used neuropathic symptoms as an outcome measure simply reported that no significant effect was seen, or otherwise did not provide any data amenable to meta-analysis. When presented, data were either continuous (e.g. a symptom score measured on a visual-analog scale) or dichotomous (e.g. symptoms present or absent, worsened or stable/improved). There was no significant difference between ARI and control subjects in the studies using quantitative pain scales, (WMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.93) more improvement with control than ARIs (<LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florkowski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Florkowski 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macleod-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macleod 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hare-1988" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hare 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1991</LINK>) (see Analysis 03.03). By contrast, in studies which evaluated symptoms as a dichotomous variable (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giugliano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giugliano 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2006</LINK>), participants treated with an ARI were significantly less likely to have unchanged or worse symptoms than were controls (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74) (see Analysis 03.01). Two of these studies were open-label (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 2006</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2006</LINK>), and one was not placebo-controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Fabiani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fabiani 1995</LINK>); if these are removed from the analysis, the relative risk is still less than one (0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75) (see Analysis 03.02).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects were reported with varying degrees of detail, with almost all studies providing some details regarding adverse effects. Insufficient data were available to perform statistical comparisons between groups. Tolrestat was associated with elevation of liver enzymes in four of the seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macleod-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macleod 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Gerven-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Gerven 1992</LINK>). Dizziness and reduced blood pressure were also more frequent in the treated group in one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boulton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 1990</LINK>). Ponalrestat, in general, was not associated with adverse effects different from placebo, except for one study, which reported decreases in hemoglobin, red blood cell count and lymphocyte count (<LINK REF="STD-Krentz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Krentz 1992</LINK>). These were not felt to be clinically significant. Sorbinil was associated with rash in seven of nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagius-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fagius 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jennings-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jennings 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyn-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Martyn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hare-1988" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hare 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SRG-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SRG 1993</LINK>). The rash was often reported as severe and associated with malaise and sometimes lymphadenopathy; in some instances the hypersensitivity reaction was labeled Stevens Johnson syndrome. In the <LINK REF="STD-SRG-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SRG 1993</LINK> study, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 7.4% of treated participants and 1% of placebo participants (P = 0.003). Two studies also reported elevation of liver enzymes in sorbinil treated participants (<LINK REF="STD-Martyn-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Martyn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hare-1988" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hare 1988</LINK>). The single study using zopolrestat reported one patient with increased liver enzymes (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2004</LINK>). The single study using fidarestat reported no difference in adverse events or laboratory abnormalities between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hotta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 2001</LINK>). In one of the three epalrestat studies increased liver enzymes were reported in 2% of participants, and nausea and diarrhea in 3% (Hotta 2006). The development of zenarestat was halted due to increases in creatinine and this was reported by both studies using zenarestat (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>). One zenarestat study also reported decreased hemoglobin and three participants with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in the treated group (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>). The authors postulated that the lymphoproliferative disorders may have preceded the use of zenarestat.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is now a substantial body of published studies of clinical trials of ARIs in diabetic polyneuropathy. Even though we excluded all trials of less than six months duration, we still identified 32 RCTs, published between 1985 and 2006, involving almost 5000 participants. Unfortunately, there are important issues of methodological quality involving most of these studies; in a substantial number, we had incomplete or inadequate information about concealment of treatment allocation, follow-up of randomized participants, and methods of randomization and blinding. </P>
<P>Unlike previous meta-analyses of ARIs in diabetic neuropathy, which focused on surrogate measures of neuropathy (primarily nerve conduction data), we elected to evaluate the effect of ARIs on the neurological examination, arguing that this is a clinically meaningful and important endpoint. Furthermore, neurological examination scales and related functional outcomes are generally accepted as the standard metric in therapeutic trials in other neuromuscular diseases, and their use facilitates comparison of the magnitudes of treatment effects between different diseases. </P>
<P>Our meta-analysis showed no statistically significant overall benefit of ARIs on neurological examination findings in diabetic polyneuropathy. A subgroup analysis of studies using tolrestat suggested benefit, although the number of treated participants was small, and the benefit did not persist when only placebo-controlled trials were included. We cannot entirely exclude the possibility that tolrestat may have benefit. However, larger trials of tolrestat were conducted and apparently did not demonstrate benefit. These data were not published and we could not obtain them. Subsequent development of tolrestat was halted because of concerns about liver toxicity. Various other subgroup analyses, such as those excluding studies involving ponalrestat (which proved not to enter peripheral nerve), poorer quality studies, or studies lasting less than one year, showed no benefit of ARIs on neurological examination findings.<BR/> <BR/>Among our secondary outcome measures, only one (neuropathic symptoms measured as a dichotomous outcome), based on six studies, reached statistical significance. However, two of these studies were non-blinded, and one was not placebo-controlled, which are likely to introduce an important bias when evaluating symptoms. When these studies were removed from the analysis, the overall relative risk still suggested benefit, but the 95% confidence interval approached one. This rather tenuous suggestion of benefit was contradicted by the lack of benefit in studies evaluating symptoms with continuous scales, and the 12 studies that simply stated that there was no benefit, without reporting data. Taken together, we think the evidence that ARIs may benefit neuropathic symptoms is unconvincing. Also noteworthy among our secondary outcome measures was the overall lack of clear improvement in electrophysiological measures, particularly motor nerve conduction velocity. Although several individual studies found that ARIs produced modest improvements in conduction velocity, the pooled results showed no benefit. Some ARIs were associated with significant adverse effects, which appeared to be compound specific. Severe hypersensitivity reactions (sorbinil), hepatic toxicity (tolrestat) and renal toxicity (zenarestat) resulted in the withdrawal of these compounds from further development. Other ARIs have not been impacted by significant adverse effect issues. </P>
<P>Some limitations of our review process must be noted. Many of the studies were conducted more than a decade ago, making it particularly difficult to clarify details of methodology. We received replies only from about half the authors we attempted to contact, and often learned that study protocols or data were no longer available. In addition to concerns about variable methodological quality and outcome measurement in the included studies noted above, there may be an important non-publication bias in ARI studies. This is suggested by the number of studies reported only in abstract or other incomplete forms, such that data for meta-analysis are either insufficient or absent. A further issue is that most of the ARI trials have been industry sponsored, and data may exist which are proprietary and thus unavailable to us. </P>
<P>Unlike many neuromuscular disorders, in which conclusions about the value of treatments are limited by a lack of RCTs, for ARIs in diabetic polyneuropathy there is a large body of RCT data to assess. Although the available RCTs are imperfect, we conclude that the accumulated evidence has not demonstrated that ARIs are effective in human diabetic neuropathy, despite attractive theoretical arguments for ARIs and promising experimental data in animals. If any further clinical trials of ARIs are undertaken, we feel it is essential that (1) any compounds tested should be proven to have substantial advantages over previously tested compounds in biological properties or preclinical results, and (2) any trial should be of at least one year duration, use clear methods of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding, have good follow-up of subjects, and employ measures based on clinical outcomes such as change in neurological examination findings, symptoms, or functional disability. <BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no overall evidence that aldose reductase inhibitors can slow or halt the natural progression of diabetic polyneuropathy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>If further clinical trials of aldose reductase inhibitors are undertaken, they should only involve compounds with substantial biological or preclinical advantages over the agents that have been tested to date. Any future trials should last at least one year, use rigorous methodology, and employ clinical endpoints as outcome measures. </P>
