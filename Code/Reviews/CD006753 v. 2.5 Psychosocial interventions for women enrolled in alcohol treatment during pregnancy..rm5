<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-17 15:17:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pregnancy can be seen as a window of opportunity where women may seek treatment for their addictions out of concern for their unborn child. Worldwide estimates of alcohol usage report that a large proportion of women continue to drink during their pregnancy. Light alcohol consumption has not been associated with adverse effects on a woman's baby, while excessive consumption of alcohol has been shown to cause a number of birth defects as well as foetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the most widely recognized cause of severe mental and developmental delay in the baby. Therefore pregnancy is an important point in time to treat women for their alcohol dependence. This review sought to find all trials which compared any psychosocial intervention to other treatment or no treatment for pregnant or postpartum women in alcohol treatment. No articles were found which fit our inclusion criteria; most trials assessed psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnant or reproductive age women, not pregnant or post-partum women in alcohol treatment. We defined alcohol treatment as when the authors stated the women were in alcohol treatment or any validated psychosocial intervention for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Control trials need to be performed on this population of women to determine the most effective therapy for pregnant women seeking treatment for their alcohol dependence.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition </HEADING>
<P>Only ten countries were found to have recommendations on alcohol use in pregnancy, all provide the guidance that women avoid from alcohol while pregnant. Three of these countries; Australia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom; also provide broader guidelines in the case that a woman decides to drink while pregnant. They state that if a woman decides to drink she should have no more seven standard drinks a week and not binge drink (<LINK REF="REF-ICAP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICAP 2007</LINK>I). Recommendations of complete abstinence are contrary to the fact that the use of alcohol during pregnancy is a common practice (<LINK REF="REF-Doggett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doggett 2006</LINK>). In the US, 11.8% of pregnant women reported recent use of alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-NSDUH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSDUH 2007</LINK>). 75% of pregnant women in Australia reported alcohol use in the last twelve months (<LINK REF="REF-NSDUH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSDUH 2007</LINK>). In the UK, 61% of mothers continued to drink alcohol while they were pregnant. The majority (71%) of those who continued to drink consumed less than 1 unit of alcohol per week and only 3% had drunk more than 7 units a week (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2006</LINK>). However, these figures are related to 'regular' use of alcohol and therefore are not necessarily at levels where there is evidence of associated harm. Some countries including Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom provide broader recommendations on alcohol use during pregnancy and state that if a woman decides to drink she should have no more one to two drinks a week and not binge drink (<LINK REF="REF-ICAP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICAP 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women choose to drink alcohol during pregnancy were advised to drink no more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week. Even though there is no safe level of alcohol consumption in pregnancy, there is no conclusive evidence that low level of alcohol consumption has any adverse effects to the unborn child (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). However, excessive alcohol use during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of miscarriage, a reduction in foetal growth and impaired neurodevelopment (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Along with these detrimental effects to both the mother's and the baby's health there are innumerable costs to the economy. Alcohol misuse is estimated to cost the economy in the region of £20 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Strategy-Unit-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strategy Unit 2003</LINK>). In developed countries, alcohol is the third leading cause of ill health after smoking and raised blood pressure. Current estimates are that for one pound spent on effective substance use treatment, five pounds is saved in health and social care costs (<LINK REF="REF-Raistrick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raistrick 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with a wide range of adverse effects both on the mother's health and her baby's. Alcohol is associated with a continuum of birth damage, which can be very serious (<LINK REF="REF-Barrison-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrison 1985</LINK>). These effects can include a combination of developmental delay, growth retardation, neurological abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphology referred to as the Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Adolescents and adults with FAS have varying degrees of psychosocial and behavioural problems (<LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 1998</LINK>). Less severe effects of alcohol use during pregnancy include mild to moderate mental and physical growth retardation, referred to as Foetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 1979</LINK>). Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has a vast impact on society and is the most commonly recognised cause of mental retardation, with as many as 5% of all congenital anomalies being attributed to prenatal alcohol exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Pietrantoni-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrantoni 1991</LINK>). Children can also be at risk of reduced developmental goal attainment as a result of either a direct effect of alcohol use or from the associated lifestyle factors connected to alcohol use (<LINK REF="REF-Belcher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belcher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frank-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2002</LINK>). Increased child abuse and neglect have been documented in some populations, as a result of alcohol use during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nair-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 1997</LINK>), along with child deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Jaudes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaudes 1997</LINK>). Other major factors which are compromised by alcohol use during pregnancy include the mother-infant attachment and responsiveness, along with post-natal depression and possible domestic violence within the household. Mothers also tend to be less likely to attend health facilities for education, medical treatment and social support (<LINK REF="REF-Doggett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doggett 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The current review examines all randomised controlled trials which determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in pregnant women who are enrolled in alcohol treatment programmes when compared to other psychosocial interventions, placebo, non-intervention, pharmacological treatment and pharmacological treatment in association with psychosocial treatment on improving birth and neonatal outcomes as well as maternal and neonatal alcohol abstinence and on treatment retention and alcohol reduction.</P>
<P>Specific interventions need to be put in place to assist pregnant women who have alcohol problems. Interventions should be aimed at harmful alcohol use, pregnancy care, health surveillance and promotion, counselling, social support, education, facilitation of mother-infant interaction and promotion of parenting (<LINK REF="REF-Doggett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doggett 2006</LINK>). Alcohol treatment may take many different forms, a physician may refer a patient to specialized services either out-patient, inpatient, group (Alcoholics Anonymous), family service agencies, hospitals or less often provide specialized alcohol treatment themselves, but they should always remain a consist source of care for primary or obstetric care (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1992</LINK>). The purpose of this is to facilitate earlier and more intensive pregnancy care, improve pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, reduce alcohol use, aid the mother-infant interaction and improve the home environment. This should then improve longer-term outcomes such as reducing child neglect, reducing mother-infant separation, improving neurodevelopmental outcomes, increasing successful schooling performance and decreasing problems in adolescence and young adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Olds-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olds 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Specific interventions should ultimately be able to link the patient into the appropriate alcohol services, provide pregnancy care including monitoring and treating infections, provide nutritional advice and support, recognise pregnancy complications such as preterm labour, facilitate the appropriate delivery care, monitor the mother's and the baby's health and facilitate their interaction with one another. The goal of intervening should also be to monitor the families' compliance with standards of parenting care and also to ensure the infant's welfare.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Pregnant women in alcohol treatment are an important population to determine the most effective intervention in order to reduce the number of infant born with foetal alcohol syndrome. A systematic review is necessary in this area as, to our knowledge, there are none to date.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-21 09:22:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found no articles which assessed the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in pregnant women in alcohol treatment. Our search included a comprehensive search of electronic databases and hand searching of references.</P>
<P>The main reason for exclusion in this review was that none of the articles focused on pregnant women in alcohol treatment. Many articles assessed the reduction of alcohol in at-risk drinkers. In America a women who continues to drink any alcohol during their pregnancy may be defined as an at risk drinker (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 2003</LINK>). This definition is different than women with alcohol dependence which is diagnosed by a multiple of cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms including alcohol seeking behaviour, compulsion to drink despite negative consequences and alcohol withdrawal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Barbor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbor 1992</LINK>) and does not mean require that the pregnant woman is drinking at the level of alcohol misuse set by NICE of more than one or two drinks a week (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). The articles we assessed were mainly aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in women during prenatal care, not providing alcohol treatment for pregnant women who have problems with alcohol. Excessive use of alcohol in pregnancy has been shown to be associated with adverse effects on the foetus but the articles found in this search focused on moderate drinkers. Part of the exclusion criteria for two studies was being in or needing alcohol treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2007</LINK>) therefore excluding the population we were hoping to assess in this review. As stated in the introduction, it is excessive alcohol use that had been associated with the most severe adverse events in pregnancy and there is inconclusive evidence on the moderate use of alcohol during this time period (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2006</LINK>). We had hoped to find evidence on psychosocial treatments aimed at pregnant alcohol abusing women, those entering treatment for their alcohol use, but this was unfortunately not the case.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-04-21 09:23:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised control trials need to be performed on pregnant alcohol abusing women in treatment to help understand the best intervention for these women. In order to decrease the rate of FAS interventions for women with alcohol problems, those that must seek treatment is an important population to focus research. Trials comparing the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for pregnant women enrolled in alcohol treatment may take place in many areas. If appropriately trained a physician may provide these sessions or refer their patients to appropriately trained individuals or groups. Setting for interventions may be physician/counsellor's office, hospital, community centre, substance abuse treatment facility or any other safe, private setting. Motivational interviewing or contingency management sessions should be provided at least weekly in the special population of pregnant alcohol abusers. Frequency of treatment, length of time per session, group vs individual, treatment duration, type of psychosocial intervention are all comparisons which could be randomised. Treatment may also be compared to no treatment, placebo, or pharmacological intervention. As the most important reason for interventions in pregnancy is the prevention of FAS and poor birth outcomes, gestational age at delivery, weight and possible signs of FAS should be reported. Other important outcomes are treatment retention, frequency of attendance, reasons for non-attendance, alcohol abstinence measures, frequency and number of alcohol drinker per week / per occasion during follow-up. This information would be useful to determine the most effective psychosocial interventions for pregnant women in alcohol treatment.</P>
