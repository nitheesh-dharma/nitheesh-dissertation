<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-05 10:02:52 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Hydralazine has been used for the treatment of high blood pressure since the 1950's. It is believed that hydralazine reduces blood pressure, however there are concerns due to the potential for this drug to cause adverse effects. The aim of this review was to determine the extent to which hydralazine reduces blood pressure, the nature of hydralazine&#8217;s adverse effect profile, and to determine the clinical impact of its use for hypertension. Unfortunately, the search revealed no randomized controlled trials which compared hydralazine to placebo as monotherapy for primary hypertension, therefore we are unable to make firm conclusions regarding its effects on blood pressure, adverse effects, or clinical outcomes. Some of the adverse effects related to hydralazine and that have been reported in the literature include reflex tachycardia, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and a lupus-like syndrome.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-25 11:25:05 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator which has been used for the treatment of hypertension since the 1950's. Although it has largely been replaced by newer antihypertensive drugs with more acceptable tolerability profiles, hydralazine is still widely used in developing countries due to its lower cost. A review of its relative effectiveness compared to placebo on surrogate and clinical outcomes is justified.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-01-06 20:59:35 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Michael R Kandler">
<P>To quantify the effect of hydralazine compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarctions, strokes, withdrawals due to adverse effects and blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-10-04 16:54:48 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Douglas M Salzwedel">
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948-August 2011), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2009) and EMBASE (1980-August 2011). Bibliographic citations from retrieved studies were also reviewed. No language restrictions were applied.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-01-06 23:38:55 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected RCTs studying the effect of oral hydralazine compared to oral placebo in patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary hypertension or gestational hypertension.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-06 20:59:03 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Michael R Kandler">
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the risk of bias tool. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-07 14:57:00 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>The search strategy did not yield any randomized controlled trials comparing hydralazine to placebo for inclusion in this review. There is insufficient evidence to conclude on the effects of hydralazine versus placebo on mortality, morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse effects, serious adverse events, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Some of the adverse effects related to hydralazine that have been reported in the literature include reflex tachycardia, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and a lupus-like syndrome.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-07 17:29:17 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Michael R Kandler">
<P>Hydralazine may reduce blood pressure when compared to placebo in patients with primary hypertension, however this data is based on before and after studies, not RCTs. Furthermore, its effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-04 17:01:35 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Douglas M Salzwedel">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-25 11:25:05 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-06-25 11:25:05 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension is associated with structural changes in the heart and blood vessels which may lead to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (i.e. cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease). Hypertension is typically defined as having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#8805; 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#8805; 90 mm Hg (<LINK REF="REF-CHEP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHEP 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>). Worldwide, approximately one billion people are affected by hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>) and seven million deaths per year may be attributed to hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In addition, for every 20 mm Hg increase in SBP and 10 mm Hg increase in DBP (through the range from 115/75 to 185/115 mm Hg) in people aged 40 to 70 years, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity doubles (<LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>). This confirms the importance of finding safe and effective treatments for the prevention of the associated mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-01-06 23:44:25 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hydralazine (1-hydrazinophthalazine) is a phthalazine derivative with a hydrazine moiety at the 1-position of the ring (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>). It was one of the first orally active antihypertensive agents and has been used for the treatment of hypertension since 1950 (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Boyle-1981" TYPE="STUDY">O'Boyle 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hydralazine has been widely used in combination with other antihypertensives, particularly beta blockers and diuretics (<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 1977</LINK>). One of the main reasons for this combination relates to the pharmacological effects of hydralazine, such as fluid retention and reflex tachycardia (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 1990</LINK>). The logic behind the inclusion of a diuretic is the elimination of fluid retention, while the beta blocker would control the tachycardia.</P>
<P>In addition to these side effects, hydralazine also causes some serious immunological reactions such as drug-induced lupus syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Alarcon_x002d_Segovia-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alarcon-Segovia 1967</LINK>). Other adverse effects include serum sickness, haemolytic anaemia, vasculitis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>). The specific mechanism of these autoimmune reactions is largely unknown.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-04-30 18:27:13 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Michael R Kandler">
<P>Blood pressure reduction is achieved through the direct relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle. The molecular mechanism by which hydralazine relaxes smooth muscle is not well understood, but may involve a fall in intracellular calcium concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-12-02 18:55:49 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the introduction of hydralazine for hypertension, a number of newer antihypertensives have become available on the market. These newer agents are regarded as being more efficacious and having a better side effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-Widgren-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widgren 1986</LINK>); however, hydralazine still remains an inexpensive alternative for the treatment of hypertension.</P>
<P>The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of hydralazine compared to placebo in lowering blood pressure, morbidity and mortality.</P>

<P>For the original 2009 review, the initial screen of titles and abstracts of all identified studies was conducted independently by two reviewers (MK, GM) and those articles which clearly did not meet the predefined inclusion criteria were excluded. Full text articles of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and translated to English where required. Studies which fulfilled the inclusion criteria were examined in detail by 4 reviewers (GM, MK, AT, SS). Reasons for excluding any study were documented. Trials with more than one publication were counted only once. Any differences that arose on whether a trial should be included or excluded were resolved through discussion with 2 independent reviewers (AT, SS), when necessary. For the 2011 update of this review, the initial screen of titles and abstracts of all identified studies was conducted by one reviewer (DS) and those articles which clearly did not meet the predefined inclusion criteria were excluded. Full text articles of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and translated to English where required.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-06-23 13:38:28 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Study characteristics and the outcome measures of interest were collected independently by the two reviewers using a pre-formed standardized data extraction sheet. Data was then cross-checked and any differences in interpretation of the data was resolved following discussion with the third independent reviewer. The data extracted from each study included the following: patient characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, and co-morbid conditions; methods including means of random allocation of participants to trial interventions, allocation concealment, blinding of patients, health care providers, and outcomes assessors, losses to follow-up and how they were handled, and duration of trial follow-up; interventions including dose and duration of hydralazine used; outcome measures as described above. All data, regardless of compliance or completion of follow up, was collected in order to allow for analysis by intention to treat.</P>
<P>The position of the patient during blood pressure measurement may affect the blood pressure lowering effect. However, in order not to lose valuable data, if only one position was reported, data from that position were extracted. When blood pressure measurement data were available in more than one position, data were extracted in accordance with the following order of preference: 1)sitting; 2) standing; and 3) supine.<BR/>In the case of missing information in the included studies, investigators were contacted (by email, letter and/or fax) to obtain the missing information. In the case of missing values for standard deviation of the change in blood pressure or heart rate, the standard deviation was imputed based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same dose. The following hierarchy (listed from high to low preference) was used to impute standard deviation values:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pooled standard deviation calculated either from the statistic corresponding to an exact p-value reported or from the 95% confidence interval of the mean difference between treatment group and placebo.</LI>

<P>For evaluation of the primary outcomes (e.g. mortality, serious adverse events, cerebrovascular events, and cardiac events), the total number of patients with at least one event within each trial was to be recorded as a percent. Proportions were to be calculated for these dichotomous outcomes, and comparisons between groups were to be presented as relative risk ratios (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals). This was, however, not done as there were no randomized trials that compared oral hydralazine against placebo.</P>
<P>Data for blood pressure reduction was to be combined using a generic inverse variancemethod. If the trial did not report the within study variance for decrease in blood pressure, the standard deviation was to be imputed from the average standard deviation from the other trials. This was, however, not done as there were no randomized trials that compared oral hydralazine against placebo and the identified cross-over trials were excluded as they were not randomized.</P>

<P>The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews have not published a review which compares hydralazine to placebo for treatment of primary hypertension. The original June 2009 searches identified 944 citations in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and IPA. Novartis, the original manufacturer of oral hydralazine, provided an additional 100 citations. Following a review of their titles and abstracts, 1010 citations that clearly did not meet our inclusion criteria were excluded while the remaining 34 citations were retrieved in full-text for further review. An additional 7 citations were retrieved in full-text for further review based on the references lists of relevant papers identified.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, none of the 41 retrieved articles met our study's inclusion criteria. Six studies were duplicate publications. Seventeen studies did not randomize patients to either an oral hydralazine group or an oral placebo group at any point during the trial. Two studies did not evaluate patients with primary hypertension. Seven studies evaluated hydralazine as an "add-on" drug to other antihypertensives for blood pressure control. Eight studies were not randomized controlled trials. One study did not publish results of patients who received only oral hydralazine versus patients who received only oral placebo.</P>
<P>An updated search in August 2011 (including pre-2005 searches of MEDLINE and pre-2007 searches of EMBASE) retrieved 2033 citations, of which 17 were retrieved in full-text for further review. Strategies used for the 2011 update are in Appendices 1-3.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-07 17:37:05 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>To the best of our knowledge, there are no parallel-group randomized controlled trials comparing hydralazine with placebo, nor are there any randomized cross-over trials of hydralazine compared to placebo. As a result, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the effect of hydralazine versus placebo on mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</P>
<P>While not included in this review, there are 6 non-randomized cross-over trials, which compared hydralazine monotherapy with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1986</LINK>, , <LINK REF="STD-Junor-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Junor 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-1975" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Persson-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 1976</LINK>, , <LINK REF="STD-Saavedra-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Saavedra 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Siitonen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Siitonen 1980</LINK>). These trials reported blood pressure readings during a placebo period and compared this information to blood pressure readings during a hydralazine period. All studies had small sample sizes (4 to 30 patients). The reported reduction in systolic blood pressure ranged from approximately 5 to 20 mmHg and the reduction in diastolic blood pressure ranged fromapproximately 5 to 15 mmHg, after 3 to 6 weeks of hydralazine.</P>
<P>Hydralazine has been used as an antihypertensive since the 1950's, and it was used commonly for blood pressure control in the 1970's and 1980's. Even though its use has largely been replaced by newer antihypertensive drugs with more acceptable tolerability profiles, it is still widely used in developing countries due to its lower cost, and in specific circumstances, such as pregnancy or heart failure. Although there is insufficient information to make conclusions about adverse effects from this review, it is important to note that adverse effects of hydralazine are not uncommon and can be serious. These include reflex tachycardia, immune mediated hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and a lupus-like syndrome (up to 10% after 3 years of treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, in addition to the fact that this review did not find any evidence of clinical outcomes benefit for the use of hydralazine in patients with primary hypertension, healthcare practitioners should also be aware that there are potential serious side effects associated with the use of hydralazine.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-07 14:59:22 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>Given the lack of evidence comparing hydralazine versus placebo for primary (essential) hypertension, hydralazine should not be recommended as monotherapy. Clinicians who wish to recommend hydralazine for their patients should understand that while hydralazine may reduce blood pressure (based on non-randomized cross-over trials), to the best of our knowledge, there are no known clinical studies which have associated the use of hydralazine with a reduction in all cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In addition, despite poor reporting of treatment-emergent adverse effects, clinicians must weigh the risks of potential serious side effects associated with the use of hydralazine, such as reflex tachycardia, hemolytic anemia, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, as well as lupus-like syndrome against the potential benefits of blood pressure reduction with no proven beneficial effect on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-07 15:00:30 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>Despite hydralazine&#8217;s widespread use as an antihypertensive agent for patients with essential hypertension, the prescribing of this agent has been based on comparative trials with other antihypertensives and not from randomized placebo-controlled trials. Due to the high incidence of adverse effects associated with hydralazine coupled with the availability of antihypertensive agents with more favourable adverse effect profiles and proven clinical efficacy, conduction of large clinical trials comparing hydralazine with other antihypertensive agents, in patients with essential hypertension, is not recommended.</P>
