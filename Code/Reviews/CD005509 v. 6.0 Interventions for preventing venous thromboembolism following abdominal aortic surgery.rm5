<TITLE>The use of anticoagulants to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-03 14:00:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a preventable complication of surgery. The blood clot can break away and travel to the lungs to cause respiratory distress and death (pulmonary embolism). Deep vein thrombosis is believed to occur less often following aortic surgery than in general surgical operations because heparin used during most vascular operations may protect against intra-operative DVT. Vascular patients are usually older, with more co-morbidity (presence of other diseases or conditions), and are subject to prolonged immobility, which increase the likelihood of developing DVT. Bleeding (haemorrhagic) complications could however occur if further anticoagulants are used for DVT prophylaxis during recovery.</P>
<P>There were no data from randomised controlled trials to indicate that postoperative anticoagulation, with or without the use of mechanical devices, can safely reduce the incidence of DVT after abdominal aortic surgery. Only two randomised controlled trials that compared anticoagulants with control were found. Ninety-eight patients completed one study where one group was randomised to receive aggressive mechanical and pharmacological DVT prophylaxis while the other group did not receive any intervention. This study reported an equal DVT incidence of 2% in both groups. The trialists did not examine for calf DVT and considered it insignificant. An earlier study reported a high incidence of DVT (24% in the control group versus 8% in the heparin group) that did not reach statistical significance. All the confirmed DVT cases were in calf veins and only one case extended above the calf. The study used a regimen of calcium heparin 2500 U pre-operatively followed by 5000 U 12 hourly for seven days and was terminated early after recruiting only 49 participants because of eight cases of major bleeding. The other trial did not report any clinically-significant bleeding problems. Minor bleeding events including wound bruising and bleeding were reported in both included studies.</P>

<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the most common, preventable complications of surgery. Although the relationship between surgery and DVT is well established in general surgical operations and most other subspecialties, the same cannot be said about arterial surgery.

<P>Intra-operative heparin is believed to provide protection during the period when DVT is most likely to develop. The practice of using intra-operative heparin could increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications if further heparin is used during the recovery period.

However, vascular patients are usually older, with more co-morbidity and are subject to prolonged immobility, all of which increase the likelihood of developing venous thromboembolism.

<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the most common, preventable complications of surgery. The blood clot can break away and travel to the lungs to cause respiratory distress and death (pulmonary embolism). Although the relationship between surgery and DVT is well established in general surgical operations and most other subspecialties, the same cannot be said about arterial surgery. This is particularly true in aortic surgery where DVT is believed to be less common, and where its management is rather controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1989</LINK>), with a reported incidence from 2% to 18% (<LINK REF="STD-Eagleton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eagleton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Olin 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>One difference between general and vascular surgery is the use of intra-operative heparin which is considered an essential step during most vascular operations. Intra-operative heparin is believed to provide protection during the period when deep vein thrombosis is most likely to develop i.e. during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Jennings-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennings 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolaides-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolaides 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satiani-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satiani 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the other hand, the practice of using intra-operative heparin could increase the risk of bleeding (haemorrhagic) complications if further anticoagulants are used for DVT prophylaxis during the recovery period (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>). This can significantly limit the use of such prophylactic measures especially with the low perceived risk of venous thromboembolism following abdominal aortic surgery.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Three authors (MBH, MT and IJ) independently selected potentially eligible articles for inclusion in the review. A study was considered eligible if it was a prospective trial with at least two concurrent comparison groups in which patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery were allocated to a regimen with anticoagulant drugs (as defined above). In order to assure clinical relevance of article selection, eligibility for inclusion was checked by a fourth author (HA).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of trials</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of each trial using a validated scale developed by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) ) which includes appropriateness of randomisation and double blinding, a description of dropouts and withdrawals. This scale consists of three items which contribute to a maximum score of five points (two points each for randomisation and double blinding, and one point for withdrawals and dropouts). However, it does not assess either concealment of allocation, or proportion and handling of dropouts and withdrawals. Three or more points are required for a trial to be judged as being of high quality.</P>
<P>We also assessed the quality score according to the criteria suggested in The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). We gave each trial an allocation score of A (clearly concealed), B (unclear if concealed) or C (clearly not concealed) and a summary score of A (low risk of bias), B (moderate risk of bias) or C (high risk of bias), according to the criteria indicated by The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). We included trials scoring A and excluded those scoring C. Two authors (MBH, MT) independently assessed trials and a third author (HA) resolved any disagreement. For each trial, we extracted the number of patients originally allocated to each treatment from the data and we performed an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Three authors (MBH, MT and IJ) independently abstracted the data. Any discrepancies were resolved by the fourth author (HA). We extracted the following data:</P>

<LI>surgical procedure performed;</LI>
<LI>prophylactic method used (including drugs and dosages);</LI>

</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>We performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines for reviews outlined in the Cochrane PVD Group's module (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html">http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html</A>). Odds ratio (OR) was used as the measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome. Where there were sufficient data, a summary statistic for each outcome was calculated using a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity in the data was noted and cautiously explored using previously identified characteristics of the studies, particularly assessments of quality. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to examine the stability of the results in relation to a number of factors including study quality, and type and duration of prophylaxis. We intended to perform subgroup analysis if there were sufficient trials to warrant it and also to consider some categories of participants separately. We will consider this, if future updates include trials with additional information.</P>
<P>All of the analyses were based on intention-to-treat data from the individual clinical trials. Treatment effects were defined as the differences of the mean changes in the incidence of DVT and PE across treatment groups. If only the number of patients was provided, it was converted to a percentage using the total number of patients as a denominator.</P>

<P>Summary details of included studies are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.<BR/>
<BR/>Twenty prospective studies considered DVT prophylaxis in arterial surgery (including aortic operations). The incidence of DVT in aortic surgery was specifically addressed by ten of these studies, only three of which were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speziale-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Speziale 1988</LINK> ). Two studies compared anticoagulants with control (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>) and thus could be considered for this review. The third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Speziale-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Speziale 1988</LINK>), compared two anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UFH)). Mechanical DVT prophylaxis was only used as an adjunct to anticoagulants and never used alone in any of these trials.</P>
<P>Most of the other studies were non-randomised and included cases of abdominal aortic surgery as a subgroup in the assessment of DVT in vascular surgery in general. However, three studies that were randomised did not meet the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Farkas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Farkas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harjola-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Harjola 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spebar-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spebar 1981</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Farkas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Farkas 1993</LINK> study compared heparin with LMWH rather than with control; while <LINK REF="STD-Harjola-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Harjola 1980</LINK> compared control with antiplatelet agents. <LINK REF="STD-Spebar-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spebar 1981</LINK> included only nine aortic cases out of a total of 46 participants which was considered too small a number to make valid conclusions.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, even the two included randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>) had limitations. The former study (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>) was terminated early before recruiting sufficient numbers needed for significant conclusions; while the <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>study did not score high in methodological quality. The latter was the only completed study that could be considered but it had a Jadad score of two and a Cochrane score for concealment of allocation of B (moderate risk of bias). Furthermore, in this study mechanical prophylaxis was used in conjunction with anticoagulation to achieve maximum DVT prophylaxis.</P>
<P>The trial by Killewich (<LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>) used serial Duplex ultrasound scans to diagnose DVT but the trialists did not scan for calf DVT whereas <LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK> used serial fibrinogen uptake scan, confirmed by venography and counted calf-DVT cases as significant.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Only two relevant studies were identified, with a total of 147 patients and 10 deep vein thrombosis events. Unfortunately, both of these studies have methodological flaws.</P>
<P>Although the study by Belch (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>) was well planned and achieved the highest Jadad score (5) and a Cochrane concealment of allocation score of 'A', it was discontinued at an early stage before reaching its target number of 150; only 49 participants were enrolled. The study by Killewich completed its recruitment to include 98 patients but scored only two on the Jadad scale and a 'B' on the Cochrane score for concealment of allocation (moderate risk of bias) (<LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>). Thus we do not have the quality nor quantity of data to be able to say anything useful about the safety or efficacy of DVT in aortic surgery. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of DVT in abdominal aortic surgery</HEADING>
<P>Of the 100 participants included in the <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK> study, 98 completed the trial. Patients were divided equally in two groups. One group received aggressive mechanical and pharmacological DVT prophylaxis while the other group did not receive any intervention. This study reported an equal DVT incidence of 2% in both groups with no major bleeding or mortality. However, the trialists did not examine for calf DVT and considered it insignificant. Interestingly, the only person in this study who developed DVT progressed into a non-fatal pulmonary embolism. This patient required prolonged intensive therapy unit (ITU) support after developing pneumonia.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK> reported a high incidence of DVT (24% in the control group versus 8% in the heparin group). However, this difference did not reach statistical significance, as the study was terminated after recruiting only 50 participants out of a planned 150. Obviously the numbers could have changed if the study was completed as planned. Interestingly, all the confirmed DVT cases were in calf veins and only one case extended above the calf which would make the incidence of "significant " DVT 2%, if the definition used by Killewich is applied.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of PE in abdominal aortic surgery</HEADING>
<P>It is worth noting that in all the studies that evaluated post-operative DVT in aortic surgery, the incidence of PE was very low (&lt; 1%) and the confirmed mortality related to it was even lower.</P>
<P>In the included studies (n=147) there was only one incident of proven non-fatal PE (<LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>). This progressed from a DVT in a patient in the control group who had a prolonged and complicated post-operative recovery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Major and fatal bleeding events</HEADING>
<P>Major bleeding events were reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>) with a very high incidence of major bleeding (18%) using a regimen of calcium heparin 2500 units pre-operatively followed by 5000 units 12 hourly for seven days. The trialists reported eight cases of major bleeding (including two fatalities and four major retroperitoneal haemorrhages). For no obvious reason this study recorded a very high incidence of major bleeding following heparin prophylaxis in aortic patients, as a result of which the study was terminated early before achieving the target numbers needed for generalisation of the results.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-03 14:00:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found only two randomised controlled trials that compared anticoagulants with control (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK>), reporting an incidence of DVT of 24% and 2% respectively. Interestingly, neither of these studies recommended anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, but for different reasons. <LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK> considered it too risky to use heparin while <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK> did not find any advantage in using heparin prophylaxis.</P>
<P>The only completed study that fulfilled all the criteria was <LINK REF="STD-Killewich-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killewich 1997</LINK> with 98 participants, half of whom were given aggressive DVT prophylaxis (mechanical and pharmacological) and the other half had no prophylaxis at all. This trial reported a very low incidence of DVT of 2% in both control and intervention group using colour flow duplex scan at one day and four weeks post operatively (below-knee DVT not addressed). Only one patient in each group developed DVT but the control case propagated into a non-fatal PE. The authors attributed this to a higher co-morbidity, and longer immobilization period in that particular patient. Consequently, the authors recommended only selective prophylaxis in high-risk groups but not routine anticoagulation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1979</LINK> reported the highest incidence of DVT in a randomised trial (24%). However, this study did not support the use of anticoagulants in vascular patients because of the high rate of clinically-significant haemorrhagic complications reported with the use of anticoagulants. Unfortunately this trial was terminated at an early stage because of significant bleeding complications in the group, with one gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and four cases of retroperitoneal haemorrhage resulting in two fatalities. Consequently, the results of this trial did not reach statistical significance. At the point when the study was terminated, 24% of the control group had developed DVT. As a result, the authors recommended prophylaxis in aortic surgery but with the avoidance of the (too risky) anticoagulants.<BR/>
<BR/>The significance of DVT comes from its ability to propagate and embolise to the lungs causing respiratory distress and even death. The fear of such complication after aortic surgery was highlighted in 1979 by Korwin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Korwin-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korwin 1979</LINK>), a retrospective study which reported (without specifying the diagnostic method) a 10.3% incidence of PE after aortic surgery (with 29% mortality) and recommended the use of vena-caval filters for aortic patients. However, such a high rate was not confirmed by any subsequent study. Excluding the Korwin study, pulmonary embolism was reported in four aortic cases only; one was a clinically-suspected PE mortality but as post mortem examination was not performed, this was not confirmed (<LINK REF="STD-Hollyoak-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hollyoak 2001</LINK>). In fact, there was no confirmed mortality due to PE in aortic surgery patients regardless of the prophylactic method used. The other three cases of PE were non fatal, one of them confirmed by V/Q scan, another received heparin prophylaxis, and the last was a patient with a complicated prolonged post-operative recovery.</P>
<P>Although the excluded studies lack the statistical power, we could still identify a general trend. In addition to important points of agreement and controversy that can be very useful to those in clinical practice and can affect future research. It is worth making some notes about their general trends in order to plan a much needed large scale study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>All the non-randomised prospective studies in aortic surgery we found did not adopt any anticoagulant regimen and reported an incidence that ranged between 0% to 20.5% averaging 9.2% (this is reduced to 2.6% if calf DVT is excluded).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The two excluded RCTs that compared heparin with LMWH (<LINK REF="STD-Farkas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Farkas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speziale-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Speziale 1988</LINK>) reported a DVT incidence of 7.5% and 7.6% respectively which is close to the no prophylaxis studies. There was no incidence of significant major bleeding in either of these studies.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>A review by Philbrick and Becker (<LINK REF="REF-Philbrick-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philbrick 1988</LINK>) supported the call for the significance of calf DVT as they calculated the risk of pulmonary embolism in calf DVT to be 10%. However, the authors of this review calculated PE risk in all-cause DVT which may not apply to surgical or vascular patients. In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Philbrick-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philbrick 1988</LINK> clearly stated that data concerning untreated patients were particularly scarce. Their conclusion in surgical group was based on two moderately strong (but old) studies (<LINK REF="REF-Doouss-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doouss 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kakkar-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkar 1969</LINK>). Neither of these studies documented their criteria to diagnose pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, the reported rate of proximal propagation varied significantly as <LINK REF="REF-Kakkar-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkar 1969</LINK> (n=39) reported a propagation rate of 23% while <LINK REF="REF-Doouss-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doouss 1976</LINK> (n=124) reported proximal propagation in only 5.6% of calf DVTs.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The argument against the significance of below-knee DVT was supported by the study of Lotke et al (<LINK REF="REF-Lotke-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotke 1984</LINK>) which used venography, plethysmography, fibrinogen scans, and ventilation perfusion lung scans for confirmation in 176 patients undergoing knee replacement. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed in only two patients (1.5%) out of the 105 patients with below-knee DVT (72%). Furthermore, the authors reported six sub-clinical PE cases that had no evidence of DVT at all, concluding that below-knee DVT though very common, has a very low risk of producing clinically-significant pulmonary embolism.</LI>
</UL>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In this review there was insufficient available evidence to justify the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis in aortic operations. In spite of retrieving a number of studies, most of them proved to be non-randomised or included a small number of participants. </P>
<P>There seem to be many points of controversy that need to be clarified before addressing the main question of DVT prophylaxis in aortic surgery. Firstly, the variation in screening tools used and their relative sensitivities There was a trend towards using Duplex scan in the most recent studies. Secondly, the significance of calf DVT. Excluding the effect of those factors would make the average incidence of DVT decrease to 6% in aortic operations. </P>
<P>In addition, some patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm do poorly post operatively and often require long stays in hospital. These patients may need to be considered as a separate group where other factors may come into play. </P>
<P>Despite controversy about defining and treating DVT in aortic surgery, there appeared to be one favourable point of agreement between all the studies, namely the small incidence of reported pulmonary embolism, as well as the rare mortality related to it (only one non-confirmed case in a non-randomised study). Although this finding suggests a genuine protective effect of intra-operative heparin, it may also reflect a failure of our investigative techniques to define precisely the extent of this phenomenon. </P>
<P>Until all those questions are answered, personal judgement may still be the main decisive factor in the management of DVT in aortic surgery. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We stress the need for a large controlled trial that clearly addresses all controversial issues, and possibly deciding beforehand the best screening tool, the significance of below-knee DVT, the incidence and relevance of sub-clinical PE, the ideal prophylactic measures, and the safety of anticoagulants in aortic surgery. </P>
