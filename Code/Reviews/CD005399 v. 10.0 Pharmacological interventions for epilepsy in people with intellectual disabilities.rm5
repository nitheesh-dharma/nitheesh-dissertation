<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common condition. Approximately 3% of the general population are diagnosed with epilepsy at some point in their life (<A HREF="Rugg-Gunn 2012">Rugg-Gunn 2012</A>). However, epilepsy is significantly more common in people with intellectual disabilities where estimates range from 14% to 44% (<A HREF="Bowley 2000">Bowley 2000</A>). People with intellectual disability and epilepsy often do not respond as well to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as the general population and behavioural disturbances are frequent. We review the use of AEDs in this population.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 2 September 2014. The included studies assessed the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. In total we included 14 studies and data from 1116 participants in the present review update. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, seven studies had insufficient information regarding how the trial was funded and one study was free from other bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This updated review confirms that in the majority of cases where intellectually disabled populations participated in trials of AEDs, moderate reductions in seizure frequency and occasional seizure freedom were obtained. The present update found that participants in the AED groups were more likely to report a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with the control groups. The results also suggested that participants in the AED group were more likely to become seizure-free and report a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with participants in the placebo group, however these results were not significant. Additionally, the results of the present update suggest that more participants in the AED groups withdrew from treatment and reported adverse effects compared with the placebo group, however these results were also not significant. Where adverse events were reported they appeared to be similar to those seen in people without intellectual disability and thus they were not specific to this population.</P>
<P>In summary, this review broadly supports the use of AEDs to reduce seizure frequency in patients with refractory epilepsy and intellectual disability. Side effects seem to be the same as in people with epilepsy without intellectual disabilities and behavioural adverse events leading to withdrawal from the treatment are rare.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence provided by this review is low to moderate. There is a large amount of variation across the studies in that different studies used different AEDs and reported different outcomes. Due to the inconsistencies between studies, not all studies could be included in the meta-analyses. Therefore the statistical analysis in the present update is limited.</P>
<P>Overall there appear to be very few high quality studies assessing pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. We hope that further research will be conducted in this area to provide a more thorough understanding.</P>

<P>The prevalence of epilepsy among people with intellectual disabilities is much higher than in the general population.

<P>For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (2 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) (2 September 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 3 September 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 3 September 2014).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-01 22:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 14 RCTs (1116 participants) in the present review. Data were heterogenous and a descriptive analysis is presented. In the majority of cases where antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were trialled in this population, we found moderate reductions in seizure frequency in that there was a significantly higher rate of responders (reduction of 50% or more) in the treatment group compared with the placebo group, with some studies reporting a higher incidence of seizure freedom in the treatment group. In general, AEDs that are proven to be effective in the general epilepsy population are also effective for refractory epilepsy in people with intellectual disability. It is not possible to comment on the relative efficacy of medications, making clinical decisions difficult.</P>
<P>In trial settings patients continued on treatment in the majority of cases. Placebo groups often experienced fewer adverse events. Where adverse events were experienced they appeared similar to those in the general population. The methods by which adverse events were recorded and reported appeared to be inconsistent, resulting in very large variation between studies. This is problematic as clinically relevant interpretation of these findings is limited.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence provided in the present review is low to moderate. Additionally the majority of studies lacked or used non-reliable measures of behavioural exacerbation. However, where measured, little obvious impact on behaviour was seen in terms of behaviour disorder.</P>

<P>This review broadly supports the use of AEDs to reduce seizure frequency in people with refractory epilepsy and intellectual disability.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:37:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder with approximately 3% of people being diagnosed at some point in their life (<LINK REF="REF-Rugg_x002d_Gunn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rugg-Gunn 2012</LINK>). The development of epilepsy in a person with intellectual disability is significantly more common, with an estimated overall prevalence rate of 14% to 44% and prevalence increases with the severity of the disability (<LINK REF="REF-Bowley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowley 2000</LINK>). A community-based study of epilepsy in intellectually disabled people showed a prevalence of 16%, significantly higher than in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2003</LINK>). In those with additional disabilities, such as cerebral palsy or postnatal brain injury, the prevalence of epilepsy can be as high as 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Goulden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulden 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1989</LINK>). The management of epilepsy in people with an intellectual disability provides additional challenges due to a number of factors, including the aetiology and severity of the epilepsy, a limited evidence base for interventions and difficulties in investigation and communication.</P>
<P>People with an intellectual disability who also have epilepsy exhibit different types and frequency of seizures; they have a higher frequency of certain epilepsy syndromes, in particular the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Mariani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariani 1993</LINK>). Furthermore, the underlying cause of the intellectual disability may have an impact on seizure type and outcome, for example tuberous sclerosis is associated with a particular seizure disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Webb-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1991</LINK>), as is Down syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Stafstrom-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stafstrom 1993</LINK>). Authors suggest that generalised seizures are the most commonly encountered seizure type in people with intellectual disabilities. According to two population-based cohort studies, 68% and 83% of the study population had generalised seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Deb-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deb 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsgren-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsgren 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rates of behavioural disturbance and psychiatric disorder have been shown to be significantly higher in people with epilepsy compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 1984</LINK>), and in people with an intellectual disability (<LINK REF="REF-Bouras-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deb-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deb 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eaton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansell 1993</LINK>). Currently, there is no consensus on whether people with both epilepsy and intellectual disability have higher rates of psychological or psychiatric morbidity compared with their peers with either epilepsy or an intellectual disability alone. A recent prospective controlled study has suggested that there is an increase in psychopathology in people with intellectual disability who have active epilepsy as compared with their peers with no seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Turky-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turky 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Espie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espie 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Espie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espie 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Gillies-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 1989</LINK> reported that people with both epilepsy and intellectual disability have poorer life skills, together with behavioural disturbances such as aggression and self injury.</P>
<P>There are a number of causes of behavioural disturbances in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability; antiepileptic medication is one of those causes. According to <LINK REF="REF-Besag-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besag 2001</LINK>, much of the published literature (unreferenced in this article) regarding behavioural disturbance associated with new antiepileptic drugs consists of unblinded studies or anecdotal case reports in people without an intellectual disability. Some of this anecdotal evidence suggests that adverse behavioural disturbances as a result of antiepileptic drug treatment are more likely to occur in people (adults and children) with an intellectual disability and epilepsy than in people with epilepsy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Beran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beran 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dam 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dulac-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dulac 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ettinger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ettinger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khurana-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khurana 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mikati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1995</LINK>). Conversely, beneficial behavioural effects in response to antiepileptic drugs have also been reported in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability (<LINK REF="REF-Gay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullens 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:37:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review will focus only on pharmacological interventions for epilepsy in people with intellectual disability. Pharmacological interventions in epilepsy aim to reduce or stop seizures. Antiepileptic medication is the standard treatment modality for epilepsy. Medication is given daily. Ideally the target is for monotherapy to control seizures but when cases do not respond to monotherapy then polytherapy is often used.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:37:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have numerous mechanisms of action; some AEDs may be more effective for certain seizure types whereas others are broad spectrum and can be used to treat a range of seizure types. These therapies aim to target neuronal receptors in order to either reduce neuronal excitation or increase inhibition, thus decreasing the likelihood of seizure discharges and therefore reducing seizure frequency.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:37:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seizure activity has a profound impact on both life expectancy and quality of life in people with an intellectual disability. A clinical decision regarding the introduction of antiepileptic medication in people with epilepsy and an intellectual disability involves an assessment of the impact of seizures on an individual, the effect that antiepileptic medication might have on an individual's seizures and an assessment of medication adverse effects.</P>
<P>In spite of the high prevalence of epilepsy in people with intellectual disability, interventional studies for the treatment of epilepsy in this group are relatively rare. In view of the fact that seizures in intellectually disabled people are often complex and refractory to treatment, and that antiepileptic medication can have a profound effect upon behaviour in this patient group, it is evident that good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed in this population.</P>
<P>The aim of our study was to assess the data available from RCTs of AED interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability and to identify the reasons for success or failure of the intervention in these studies. We assessed both beneficial and harmful outcomes.</P>

<P>We carried out updated searches to include all studies published from the date of the previous search (September 2012) to 2 September 2014. We identified 68 studies in total. After initial screening, we excluded 60 studies as they were irrelevant. We carried out full-text review on the remaining eight studies.

<BR/>This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial studying the effect of flunarizine add-on therapy in refractory childhood epilepsy. Inclusion criteria included being aged 18 years or less, having clearly and reliably documented epileptic seizures, a seizure incidence for absences and myoclonic attacks of not less than one per day and for all other seizure types of not less than four per month. Antiepileptic drug regimen was optimised as far as possible by adjustment of serum levels. No evidence of non-compliance and informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria included any serious illness other than epilepsy, the regular taking of drugs other than antiepileptic drugs, pregnancy or risk of conception in females of reproductive age. Twenty patients (10 male, 10 female) aged six to 18 years (mean age 12 years seven months) were entered into the study; however, seven were withdrawn (three male, four female). The reasons for withdrawal included: one non-compliance, two withdrawal of consent (not caused by deterioration of seizures or flunarizine adverse events), one drowsiness (probably drug-related), one due to intercurrent illness unrelated to therapy, one patient missed several review appointments, and one missed the final examination because of non-medical problems. All data therefore related to 13 patients (two patients were aged below 12 years). Twelve patients had 'mental retardation'; one mild, one moderate and 10 with severe 'retardation'. Epilepsy types included: symptomatic generalised epilepsy (10), cryptogenic generalised epilepsy (two), symptomatic partial epilepsy (one), myoclonic absences (one) and temporal lobe epilepsy (one). The dosage regime of flunarizine was 5 mg per day (for patients less than 10 years of age) or 10 mg per day (for patients older than 10 years of age). Evaluation of the activity of flunarizine was based on the total number of seizures observed during the treatment phase (four months for each cross-over leg). No adverse effects were seen in those patients completing the trial.</P>

<BR/>This was an unblinded, parallel, add-on RCT study comparing the efficacy and safety of gabapentin and lamotrigine in adults with learning disabilities. Inclusion criteria included: aged 12 years and over, of either sex and with localisation-related epilepsy that was not satisfactorily controlled by existing antiepileptic drugs. Participants had to be taking one, two or three standard antiepileptic drugs (not including gabapentin or lamotrigine) but still not achieving satisfactory control; and have a minimum of four seizures in each 28-day period and no seizure-free 28-day period in the preceding three months. Patients had to have a degree of learning disability and meet any level of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria for mental retardation.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria included: individuals who had had primary generalised seizures, symptomatic generalised epilepsy or a history of non-epileptic seizures; concurrent therapy with antacids or a recent participation in any clinical trial; pregnant women and women of childbearing age not using adequate contraception; and a known hypersensitivity to gabapentin or lamotrigine or significant renal or hepatic dysfunction. Eighty-three patients were randomised (53 male, 30 female), age range 15 to 59 years; the mean age for the gabapentin-treated group was 38 years. Thirty-four patients who were treated with gabapentin completed the study and 35 patients treated with lamotrigine completed the study, indicating that five gabapentin-treated patients and nine lamotrigine-treated patients either withdrew or dropped out. Results were analysed by intention-to-treat. The reasons for withdrawal or dropout in the gabapentin-treated group included: adverse events (n = 3), other (n = 1) and protocol violation (n = 1). In the lamotrigine-treated group the reasons included: carer withdrawal of consent (n = 1), adverse events (n = 4) and other (n = 4). All patients had a degree of intellectual disability and had to meet any level of the DSM-IV criteria for mental retardation. The seizure types present in the gabapentin group included: simple partial (9%), complex partial (49%), secondary generalised (34%), absence (3%), tonic (0%) and other (5%) and in the lamotrigine group they included simple partial (13%), complex partial (43%), secondary generalised (37%), absence (2%), tonic (2%) and other (3%). The dose of gabapentin was increased during the 14-week titration period at the investigators' discretion, to a maximum of 3600 mg. The mean dose during the 10-week evaluation period was 1749 mg per day (minimum = 400 mg and maximum = 3600 mg). The primary efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in seizure frequency between the baseline period and the last eight weeks of the treatment period, assessed using the R-ratio= (T - B)/(T + B) where T and B were the seizure frequencies per 28 days during treatment and baseline respectively. Secondary outcome measures included the number of responders (seizure frequency reduced by 50% or more) and an assessment of mood, behaviour and dependency. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (62% with gabapentin and 50% with lamotrigine). Approximately 10% reported serious adverse events on gabapentin and 11% on lamotrigine.</P>

<BR/>This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial evaluating the effects of cinromide in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Inclusion criteria included: only patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; patients aged two to 18 years; patients must have had seizures for at least six months and could be receiving no more than three concomitant antiepileptic drugs; parents/guardians had to demonstrate their ability to administer medications as instructed and to maintain satisfactory seizure counts according to the study protocol. Exclusion criteria consisted of: patients with a history of tonic-clonic status epilepticus within the previous six months; an anoxic episode requiring resuscitation during the previous year; a progressive central nervous system (CNS) lesion or progressive hepatic; cardiovascular, haematopoetic, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, ophthalmologic or endocrine disease; a predisposing condition which might interfere with absorption, distribution or excretion of drugs; severe adverse effects from pre-study medications; changes to medication regimen within the previous four weeks; if they had been maintained on a ketogenic diet within the previous two weeks or treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticosteroids within the previous four weeks; previous exposure to cinromide; severe learning disability or other impairment that safety and efficacy evaluations would have been unreliable or difficult to perform. Seventy-three patients were randomised but sufficient data for analysis were available for only 56 patients (26 treated with cinromide and 30 on placebo). No information was provided regarding withdrawals or dropouts. The age range for the 56 evaluable patients was two to 18 years; the mean for the cinromide group was 7.38 (SD 3.65) and the mean for the placebo group was 7.93 (SD 4.87). Thirty-four patients were male and 22 female. The level of intellectual disability was stated and patients with severe retardation were excluded from the study. Epilepsy was defined according to a modification of the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures. Seizure types included: absence seizures (39), myoclonic seizures (36), tonic seizures (25), atonic seizures (30) and tonic clonic seizures (20). Cinromide was initiated at doses of 20 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day and further increases (to a total daily maximum of 83 mg/kg to 109 mg/kg) were prescribed at weekly visits according to a fixed dosing schedule. The objective was to achieve an optimal dose during the first six treatment weeks and to maintain this dose during the last 12 treatment weeks. Concomitant AEDs could be changed during the treatment period if plasma drug concentrations exceeded specified limits above or below baseline means. The primary statistical analysis of seizure frequency compared the changes from the baseline period (six weeks) to the treatment period (12 weeks for most patients) in the cinromide and placebo groups. Global rating scale evaluations at weeks 12, 18 and 24 were also compared. No information was given on adverse events. This study was terminated early when it became clear that cinromide was not effective.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial evaluating the efficacy of lamotrigine in children and adolescents with refractory generalised epilepsy. Inclusion criteria were all children older than two years and adolescents with refractory or intractable generalised epilepsy with more than two seizures per month. Exclusion criteria were the presence of liver, renal or progressive neurologic disease or the diagnosis of focal disease. Thirty consecutive patients (15 male, 15 female) were entered into the study; the age range was 2.5 to 22 years, median age 9.9 years. Patients entered into an open-phase study, with a duration of two to 12 months, during which time the optimal lamotrigine dose was found for each child. Those who were categorised as responders (more than a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, severity or both; or improvements in behaviour or motor skills, or both) were then randomised into the double-blind phase. Seventeen patients were randomised to receive either lamotrigine or placebo. Two patients were withdrawn and data from 15 patients were used in the analyses. Of the randomised patients, all had mental retardation (IQ less than 70). Seizure types included tonic-clonic (nine), tonic/atonic (15), myoclonic (16), atypical absences (14) and other seizure types (two). The dosing regime was individualised and determined during the open-phase period. Patients were taking one to three other antiepileptic drugs. The primary outcome measure was the percentage reduction in mean monthly seizure frequency. Secondary outcome measures included severity of seizures, functional status of patient and frequency of adverse events. During the cross-over phase no adverse events were seen in the lamotrigine group; however, in the placebo group 10 had fatigue and four had more intense seizures.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gigli-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gigli 1988</LINK> (Italian article)<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study evaluating the effect of flunarizine in an intellectually disabled population with epilepsy. Inclusion criteria were not stated. Twenty-six patients were randomised to one of two groups: group I would receive flunarizine in the first arm and a placebo in the second whereas group II would receive the placebo in the first arm and flunarizine in the second. The mean age of group I (10 males, five females) was 11.7 years and of group II (one male, 10 females) was 18.3 years (the groups differed in respect of the proportion of patients with secondary generalised epilepsy and partial epilepsy). Intellectual disability was described in 25 patients as slight (three), moderate (seven) and severe (15). Seizure types included: six patients with secondary generalised epilepsy and nine patients with partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalisation (Group I); and seven patients with secondary generalised epilepsy and four with partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalisation (Group II). There was a baseline period of three months followed by a three-month treatment period, a three-month washout period and a three-month treatment period. The dosing regime was not described, however the dose of flunarizine was 10 mg/day; patients were maintained on the medication they were receiving prior to the start of the study. A primary efficacy variable was not stated but alterations in seizure frequency were recorded together with behavioural observations. In group I additional data were obtained in patients with the ability to respond on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): electroencephalography (EEG) together with an attention test (Toulouse modified). No adverse effects or withdrawals were reported. For the update in 2014, this paper was unavailable. We contacted the study authors but access to the full-text paper was unavailable.</P>

<BR/>This was randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of antiepileptic drug rufinamide in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The eligible patients were between four and 30 years of age (median 12), and had multiple types of seizures (including tonic-atonic and atypical absences) with a minimum of 90 seizures in the month before baseline and a recent history of a slow spike and wave pattern on EEG. Patients who were receiving more than three AEDs, pregnant or not using adequate contraception, had correctable aetiology of their seizures, had history of generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus within 30 days of baseline or had a history of any clinically significant non-neurological medical condition were excluded. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were randomised, receiving either rufinamide (n = 74) or placebo (n = 64). The two treatment groups had a compatible distribution of concomitant AEDs with valproic acid, lamotrigine and topiramate being the most frequently used. This study consisted of a 28-day baseline period followed by a 84-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group treatment period. This phase consisted of a 14-day titration period followed by a 70-day maintenance period. The target dosage was approximately 45 mg/kg of rufinamide per day. The primary efficacy was defined as reduction in total seizure frequency, tonic-atonic ("drop attack") seizure frequency and seizure severity rating. The secondary efficacy measures were response to treatment (% of patients with at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the double-blind phase), % change in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to baseline (for each seizure subtype other than tonic-atonic) and parental global evaluation (alertness, interaction with environment, daily activity performance, responsiveness to verbal request and seizure severity). Ten patients in the rufinamide group discontinued therapy (six because of adverse effects, three for unsatisfactory therapeutic effect and one for withdrawal of consent). Five patients in the placebo group did not complete the study (two for protocol violations, one for unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, one due to an administrative problem and one following withdrawal of consent).</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled, cross-over study evaluating the pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy of a conventional carbamazepine preparation (three daily doses) and a slow-release carbamazepine preparation (two daily doses) in intellectually disabled patients. Inclusion criteria were: only people previously treated with carbamazepine and whose carbamazepine concentrations had been on a therapeutic level for at least two months, and in spite of treatment, were suffering four seizures per month or more. All patients were intellectually disabled. Twenty-one patients (nine males, 11 females) were randomised but one was withdrawn due to appendicitis. The mean age of the 20 evaluable patients was 24.9 years (range six to 38 years). Seizure types/syndromes included: partial seizures (four), secondary generalised (eight), primary generalised (two) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (six). There was a baseline period of two months followed by two 10-week treatment periods. During the two study periods, the daily dose of carbamazepine was the same as during the baseline period. Conventional carbamazepine was given three times daily and the slow-release carbamazepine twice daily. Placebo tablets were used to make the daily number of tablets taken identical; the double-dummy technique was used. Primary efficacy variables were not stated, however, in the aims section the authors stated that the aims were: (a) to carry out a 24-hour pharmacokinetic trial comparing slow-release carbamazepine and conventional carbamazepine when given at different dosing frequencies, and (b) to look at what effect a reduction in dosing frequency of carbamazepine had on seizure control, that is the difference between slow-release and conventional carbamazepine. No information was given regarding adverse events.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of topiramate in patients with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. Patients were included if they were aged 12 years and above; weighed at least 45 kg; had a diagnosis of epilepsy with a documented six-month history of at least four seizures per month; and an intellectual disability, defined as significantly below average general intellectual functioning and an IQ of less than 70. Patients had to be on treatment with one to three other antiepileptic drugs and to have an identified carer. Patients were excluded if they had absence seizures only, or non-epileptic seizures; a history of psychosis or psychiatric problems in the last year; nephrolithiasis or renal impairment; previous treatment with topiramate; or treatment in the last three months with acetazolamide, zonisamide, triamterene, more than 2 g/day of vitamin C or chronic use of antacids or calcium supplements; or women who were pregnant, lactating or without adequate contraception. Seventy-four patients were randomised in equal numbers to the topiramate and placebo groups. Seventeen patients withdrew and an intention-to-treat analysis was performed both for the efficacy data (n = 72) and the safety data (n = 74). The actual numbers completing the study were 28 in the topiramate group and 29 in the placebo group. The age of the patients was 12 years and above, with 39 males and 34 females. All patients had an intellectual disability, defined as a significant below-average general intellectual functioning and an IQ of 70 or less. Seizures were classified in accordance with the International Classification of Seizures. Seizure types included generalised tonic-clonic (n = 36), partial (n = 54), partial with generalisation (n = 34) and other types (n = 33). The drug dose regime consisted of an 18-week titration phase to achieve the optimum dose of study drug, to a maximum of 400 mg/day topiramate (for adults) or 9 mg/kg/day (children) and a 12-week maintenance period where the dose of study medication and concomitant medications remained constant. Patients were taking up to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs. The primary efficacy variables were the mean change in total seizure frequency and the mean change in seizure severity during the treatment phase. Adverse events were reported by 92% of patients in the topiramate group and 84% in the placebo group. Sixteen per cent of the topiramate group reported serious adverse events, possibly drug-related in four cases and 11% in the placebo group. The number of patients reporting at least one adverse event leading to a permanent stop in study medication was 18.9% (n = 7) in the topiramate group and 16.2% (n = 6) in the placebo group.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study examining the effect of lamotrigine in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Inclusion criteria included patients having more than one type of predominantly generalised seizure for at least one year, under 11 years of age at the onset of epilepsy, seizures at least every other day, intellectual disability based on IQ or developmental assessments and recent EEGs showing an abnormal background and a pattern of slow spike-and-wave complexes. Exclusion criteria included if patients had a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, were receiving more than three antiepileptic drugs, weighed less than 15 kg or were taking valproate. A total of 169 patients were randomised, 79 to lamotrigine (68% male) and 90 to placebo (50% male). For safety data analyses 169 patients were evaluable and for efficacy data 167 patients were evaluable; two patients were excluded due to lack of data. Seven patients in the lamotrigine group were withdrawn early, four due to protocol violations and three due to adverse events. Fourteen patients in the placebo group did not complete the study; three due to protocol violations, seven due to adverse events and two due to deterioration of seizure control. These 21 patients were included in the analyses using an 'as treated analysis' rather than a true intention-to-treat analysis. Age range was three to 25 years (mean = 9.6 years). All patients had intellectual impairment: 92% (n = 73) had moderate to severe intellectual disability in the lamotrigine group and 91% (n = 82) in the placebo group. Patients were assigned to one of four dosing regimens according to concomitant valproate use and body weight. The 16-week treatment period comprised a six-week titration period, two weeks in which the dose was fixed and an additional eight weeks during which the fixed dose could be increased during week eight or 12 to no more than the maximal allowable daily dose. Primary efficacy variables included: (a) percentage change from baseline in the frequency of major motor seizures, and (b) median changes from baseline in the frequency of drop attacks, tonic clonic seizures and atypical absences. The primary safety variable was the frequency of reported adverse events. The adverse event most frequently responsible for withdrawal was clinical deterioration of seizure control (one patient in the lamotrigine group and six in the placebo group).</P>

<BR/>This was a multi-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial examining the effect of clobazam in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It was conducted at 51 sites in the United States, India, Europe and Australia between August 2007 and December 2009. Inclusion criteria included: aged two to 60 years old, weigh 12.5 kg or over, onset of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome before the age of 11, one or more generalised seizures (including drop seizures) for six months or longer and a previous EEG report showing generalised, slow spike-and-wave patterns (&lt; 2.5 Hz). A total of 238 patients were randomised to one of four groups: 59 participants in the placebo group, 58 participants in the low-dose group (clobazam 0.25 mg/kg/day; maximum 10 mg/day), 62 participants in the medium-dose group (clobazam 0.5 mg/kg/day; maximum 20 mg/day) and 59 participants in the high-dose group (clobazam 1.0 mg/kg/day; maximum 40 mg/day). The study included a four-week baseline period, a three-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period, followed by either continuation in an open-label study or a two to three-week taper period. A total of 177 participants completed the study: 41/59 participants in the placebo group, 50/58 in the low-dose group, 45/62 in the medium-dose group and 41/59 in the high-dose group. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out on all participants who did not have one or more daily seizure measurement during the maintenance period, which was 217 participants. The percentage of patients who reported experiencing one or more adverse effects was 67.8% for placebo, and 72.4%, 88.7% and 76.3% for the low-, medium- and high-dosage groups, respectively. Adverse effects that had more than a 10% difference in reports from participants in the placebo group and any clobazam groups were somnolence, pyrexia, lethargy, drooling and constipation. Sedation was reported in 4.5% (8/177) clobazam-treated patients (one in the low-, two in the medium- and five in the high-dosage group). Of the adverse effects, somnolence and drooling increased with increasing clobazam dosages. Twenty-nine participants (one in the placebo group, and four in the low-, nine in the medium- and 15 in the high-dosage group) had their dosage reduced during the study because of an adverse effect. A dose-related trend was observed for overall adverse effects, which led to discontinuation from the study. In total 27 participants (two in the placebo group, and four in the low-, eight in the medium- and 13 in the high-dosage group) discontinued because of adverse effects. Sixteen participants reported serious adverse effects (two in the placebo group, and three in the low-, six in the medium- and five in the high-dosage group). Serious adverse effects included lobar pneumonia and pneumonia.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on, parallel study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of felbamate in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Inclusion criteria included: males and females with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had a history of multiple types of seizures and a minimum of 90 atonic or atypical absence seizures per month during an eight-week pre-study screening phase; were taking no more than two antiepileptic drugs; had no evidence of progressive central nervous system lesions on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography; weighed at least 11.3 kg and had a slow spike-wave complex on EEG. Exclusion criteria were: females who were pregnant or not using adequate contraception; a history of identifiable progressive neurologic disorders; anoxic episodes within the past year; poor compliance with past antiepileptic therapy; recent drug or alcohol abuse; a major medical illness or previous suicide attempts; recently received corticotropin; following a ketogenic diet; or inadequate supervision. Seventy-three patients were randomised, 37 to the felbamate treatment group and 36 to the placebo group. All patients were included in the statistical analyses for efficacy and safety. Two patients were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events, one from each group. The age range was four to 36 years; 51 were male and 22 female. The authors give no specific details on the level of intellectual disability in the randomised population, however the introduction indicates that Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is "characterised by mental retardation". Patients had multiple types of seizures as characterised by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Seizures were classified according to the ILAE 1981 classification. Felbamate was titrated during the first 14 days of the treatment phase to a maximum of 45 mg/kg/day or 3600 mg/day, whichever was less, followed by a 56-day maintenance period. Felbamate was given in addition to the patients' current antiepileptic drugs, but patients could not be on more than two antiepileptic drugs before study initiation. The primary efficacy variables were the per cent change in average seizure frequency between baseline and the treatment phase for the two groups, parents'/guardians' global evaluations of the patients' quality of life and the total number of atonic seizures. Efficacy was also assessed by two secondary variables: parental counts of total seizures and parental counts of generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The evaluation of safety included monitoring adverse events, vital signs and body weight, general physical and neurologic examinations, measurements of plasma concentrations of felbamate and standard antiepileptic drugs and clinical laboratory evaluations. Adverse events were similar in the two groups although anorexia, vomiting and somnolence occurred more frequently in the felbamate group and diarrhoea occurred more frequently in the placebo group. Severe effects were reported by eight patients in the felbamate group and three in the placebo group. One patient in the felbamate group withdrew due to somnolence and ataxia and one patient in the placebo group withdrew due to pancreatitis.</P>

<BR/>This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of topiramate in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients had to be aged between one and 30 years, weigh at least 11.5 kg, have an EEG showing a slow spike-and-wave pattern, seizure types including tonic-atonic and either a history of or active atypical absences. Other types could include tonic-clonic, myoclonic and partial onset seizures. Patients had to have at least 60 seizures during the month prior to entering the baseline phase while being maintained on one or two standard antiepileptic drugs. Patients were excluded if they had a history of recent cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal or haematologic illness or malignancy; seizures due to progressive disease, documented status within three months of baseline; drug or alcohol abuse; a psychiatric or mood disorder requiring medication or electroconvulsant therapy, within six months of baseline; poor compliance with therapy; anoxic episodes requiring resuscitation within one year before the study or nephrolithiasis; treatment with, or use of, an experimental drug or device within 60 days of baseline, use of acetazolamide or zonisamide within 60 days of baseline; treatment with a ketogenic diet or adrenocorticotropic hormone within six months before the study; use of benzodiazepines on more than an occasional basis; presence of clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities; and history of inability to take medication or maintain a seizure calendar, independently or with assistance. Ninety-eight patients were randomised to the study, 48 patients to receive topiramate and 50 to receive placebo. One patient was considered to be a premature withdrawal and seizure counts were estimated from data provided at the final visit. Age ranges for the topiramate group were two to 29 years (mean 11.2 years) and were two to 42 years (mean 11.2 years) for the placebo group. Fifty-three patients were male and 45 were female. The authors give no specific details on the level of intellectual disability in the randomised population, however they state that Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is "characterised by mental retardation". Seizures were classified according to the <LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1989</LINK> classification. Seizure types included tonic-atonic, atypical absences, tonic-clonic, myoclonic and partial seizures. The most common seizure types recorded during the baseline period were; atonic (90 patients), atypical absence (70), tonic (51), myoclonic (46), tonic-clonic (38), complex partial (16), absence (nine), partial evolving to secondary generalised (four), clonic (two) and unspecified (six). The dosing schedule involved a titration period divided into three one-week intervals. In the first week the drug dosage was approximately 1 mg/kg/day administered twice daily in equal doses. Dosage was then increased to approximately 3 mg/kg/day during the second week and to the target dose of 6 mg/kg/day during the third week. Patients were then followed for an eight-week maintenance period on 6 mg/kg/day or their maximum tolerated dose. At study entry all patients were taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs. The primary determinant of efficacy was based on a statistically significant between-group difference with respect to either a reduction in average monthly seizure rate for all seizure types combined or each component of a compound variable consisting of a per cent reduction in drop attacks (tonic and atonic) and the parental global evaluation of seizure severity. Secondary efficacy variables were a reduction in the average monthly rate of major seizures (drop attacks and tonic-clonic) and the percentage of patients considered to be treatment responders, defined as those with a 50% or more, 75% or more or 100% reduction from baseline for drop attacks, major seizures and all seizures. Twenty-three per cent of topiramate-treated patients had severe adverse events compared with 10% of the placebo-treated patients. Three patients in the placebo group and nine in the topiramate-treated group experienced at least one adverse event that required either a dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of treatment. However, no patient discontinued the study due to an adverse event.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial evaluating the efficacy of felbamate as add-on therapy to valproic acid in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients were included if they had a clinical diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and were able to tolerate valproic acid monotherapy, had discontinued all benzodiazepines for at least four weeks and carbamazepine or phenytoin for at least two weeks prior to study entry. Patients were excluded based on the following criteria: history of generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus within six months prior to entrance; the presence of serious medical or psychiatric disorders requiring medication; clinical imaging or electrographic evidence for a partial seizure disorder or structural abnormality; presence of a metabolic disorder; presence of a known, treatable seizure aetiology; alcohol or drug abuse or progressive neurological disorders; a history of poor compliance with antiepileptic drug therapy; if routine laboratory screening yielded any results of a white blood cell count of less than 3000/mm and less than 50% granulocytes, a platelet count of less than 100,000/mm, a haemoglobin count of less than 11 or an SGOT (serum glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase), SGPT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase) or alkaline phosphatase level greater than twice the upper limit of normal. Fourteen patients were randomised to the study; there was one withdrawal (reason not stated) and therefore, 13 patients were used in the data analysis. The age range was 4.2 to 15.7 years and there were seven males and seven females. The authors do not indicate any specific levels of learning disability except that all patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The authors also do not state which classification system was used to diagnose seizures; however, seizure types included generalised tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic or myoclonic seizures. Patients needed to be on sodium valproate, the concomitant drug, as monotherapy (at steady state) prior to adding in the felbamate or placebo. Felbamate/placebo titration began on day one at 15 mg/kg/day in four daily doses, and was then increased by 15 mg/kg/day every three days up to a dose of 45 mg/kg/day on day seven, with a maximum dose of 3600 mg/day. Observations started on day 10 and lasted seven weeks. On days 59 to 71, cross-over to the alternate regime and washout occurred at the same rate as for the initial titration. Observations for the second cross-over period lasted from days 72 to 121. The only concomitant therapy was valproic acid. A primary efficacy variable was not stated, however the outcomes measured were: the percentage change in total seizure frequency after felbamate/placebo add-on to valproic acid, compared with baseline (valproic acid monotherapy); and seizures, both clinical and electrographic, counted from video-EEG tapes. Patients' parents reported no adverse events from felbamate; however, there was a significant decrease in the mean white blood counts, which was related to the felbamate levels and mean platelet counts associated with increased valproic acid levels.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Yamatogi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yamatogi 1997</LINK> (Japanese article)<BR/>This was a randomised, single-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel trial evaluating the effect of clobazam in intractable childhood epilepsies. Patients were included if they had intractable symptomatic/cryptogenic generalised childhood epilepsy, experienced one or more seizures per week, were aged 17 years or less and the number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs was three or less. Patients were excluded if they were taking benzodiazepines at the time of recruitment. Eighty patients were randomised, 38 to clobazam and 42 to the comparator drug clonazepam. Sixty-six patients (34 clobazam, 32 clonazepam) were analysed for efficacy data and 76 (36 clobazam, 40 clonazepam) were analysed for safety data. The age range of the patients was 10 months to 17 years, with 39 males and 27 females. Ninety-two per cent (61/66) of the patients were classed as intellectually disabled. Seizure types included simple partial (two), complex partial (five), secondary generalised (three), atypical absence (eight), myoclonic (15), tonic (29), tonic spasm (33), generalised tonic clonic (14), atonic (seven) and other (three). Fifty per cent of patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients were started on clobazam at 0.2 mg/kg/day and increased stepwise 0.2 mg/kg/day over two to four weeks, up to 0.8 mg/kg/day. All patients except for two were taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs. The primary efficacy variable was the number of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Seizure frequency at the end of the treatment phase (12 weeks) was compared with the frequency at the end of the baseline period of four weeks. A total of 41.7% of patients treated with clobazam experienced an adverse event compared with 57.5% of patients treated with clonazepam. Fourteen patients were withdrawn from the study, only two due to drug adverse events.</P>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 1993</LINK> found an 11% decrease in seizure frequency in the felbamate-treated group as compared with a 1% increase in the placebo-treated group (P value = 0.32).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK> reported that the median reduction from baseline for all major seizures in the lamotrigine-treated group was 32% and in the placebo-treated group was 9% (P value = 0.002) during a 16-week treatment period. The results were similar when drop attacks and tonic-clonic attacks were examined separately.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> reported a mean percentage reduction in seizure frequency of 50.6% in the gabapentin group and 50.8% reduction in the lamotrigine group.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Kaski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kaski 1991</LINK> looked at the effects of conventional carbamazepine as compared with slow-release carbamazepine and found the mean total number of seizures during the treatment phases was nearly equal: 42.7 (range 4 to 107) during conventional carbamazepine and 44.0 (range 9 to 133) during slow-release carbamazepine treatment. Each cross-over leg was a period of 10 weeks each.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1999</LINK> looked at the effects of felbamate plus valproic acid compared with placebo plus valproic acid.

There was no significant difference between parental seizure counts and the EEG seizure count recordings.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1991</LINK> showed there was a lower total seizure incidence during the flunarizine period in comparison to the placebo period in five out of 13 patients. The difference between the flunarizine period and the placebo period was not statistically significant. The median total number of seizures during the flunarizine period was 74 (range 13 to 6000) and during the placebo period was 78 (range 22 to 6000).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gigli-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gigli 1988</LINK> demonstrated no significant differences in seizure frequency between the flunarizine and placebo groups (although no p values were given).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> found the percentage of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in seizure frequency on gabapentin was 50% and on lamotrigine was 48.6%, showing no significant difference.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK> indicated a higher 50% responder rate in the rufinamide group compared with placebo for total seizures (P value = 0.0045) and tonic-atonic seizures (P value = 0.002).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK> found that 33% of lamotrigine-treated patients and 16% of placebo-treated patients had a reduction of at least 50% in the frequency of all types of major seizures (P value = 0.01). Significantly more lamotrigine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients had a reduction of at least 50% in the frequency of drop attacks and tonic-clonic seizures (P value = 0.04 and P value = 0.007).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK> found that nine patients (60%) showed a greater than 50% seizure reduction during the lamotrigine phase; one patient showed a greater than 75% decrease in seizure frequency and one patient was seizure-free. No patients showed any improvement during the placebo phase.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> showed that the percentage of patients with a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in major seizures (drop attacks and tonic-clonic seizures) during the double-blind phase was significantly greater in the topiramate group compared with placebo (33% versus 8%, P value = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference between the treatment group and the placebo group with respect to all seizures in the 50% or greater responder group. Eight topiramate-treated (17%) versus two (4%) placebo-treated patients had a 75% or greater reduction in major seizure rates and one patient in the topiramate group was free of major seizures during the double-blind phase. During the double-blind phase, 28% (13/46) of the topiramate-treated patients achieved a 50% or greater reduction in drop attacks compared with 14% (7/49) of the placebo-treated patients. A 75% or greater reduction in the frequency of drop attacks was achieved in 17% (8/46) of the topiramate group and 6% (3/49) of the placebo group. One patient (2%) from the topiramate group had no drop attacks during the double-blind phase. However, Kerr 2005 found there was no statistical difference between the topiramate and placebo-treated groups in the number of responders: 29.7% and 25.7%, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2011</LINK> reported percentages of participants who had a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in average weekly drop seizures: 31.6% of participants in the placebo group compared with 43.3%, 58.3% (P value = 0.0159) and 77.6% (P value &lt; 0.0001) for low, medium and high clobazam dosage groups, respectively. Yamatogi 1997 found that 61.8% of clobazam-treated patients and 21.9% of clonazepam-treated patients had a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency.</P>
<P>We included four studies in a meta-analysis of responder rates for overall seizure frequency (50% or greater reduction in overall seizure frequency) (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK>). We identified no statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 17%). The results of the analysis showed that significantly more people in the AED groups had a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with people in the placebo groups (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.60 to 4.14). As there were zero events in one trial, we also calculated the risk difference (RD 0.16, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. However, it is unclear why <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> reported this result out of 46 people in the intervention group as it was previously stated that an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out and therefore it would be expected that the results would be out of 48 participants.</P>
<P>We combined data from two studies in a meta-analysis of responder rates for drop seizure frequency (50% or greater reduction in drop seizure frequency) (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK>). As <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2011</LINK> included multiple-dose arms, we pooled the intervention groups in a meta-analysis. We identified significant statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 80%) therefore we adopted a random-effects model. The results of the analysis showed a trend in favour of the AED groups in that more people in the intervention groups reported a 50% or greater reduction in drop seizure frequency, however, this result was not significant (RR 6.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 133.89). However, there was a very large, imprecise effect in <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> due to zero events in the placebo group, therefore we calculated the risk difference and this indicated that participants in the treatment group showed a significant decrease in the frequency of drop seizures (RD 0.30, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crumrine-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crumrine 1989</LINK> reported that global evaluation data, which included seizure severity ratings, failed to show any differences between the cinromide and placebo-treated patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> reported that the key carer rating scale showed significant improvement in seizure severity in the gabapentin-treated patients and also in the lamotrigine comparator-treated patients.

<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK>, the rufinamide group had a greater improvement in seizure severity compared with the placebo group (P value = 0.0041).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> found that patients treated with topiramate were nearly twice as likely to show an improvement in seizure severity based on parental global evaluation (P value = 0.037), however <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK> showed that there was no significant difference between the topiramate and placebo groups in the mean seizure severity scores for the different seizures as assessed by the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3).</P>

<P>Three studies reported behavioural outcomes:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> reported data using the Crichton Royal Behaviour Rating Scale, which showed significant improvement, compared with baseline, in co-operation and restlessness in the gabapentin-treated patients. Significant differences between the gabapentin and lamotrigine groups were seen in communication, co-operation and restlessness on the Crichton Royal Behaviour Rating Scale. The total score also improved significantly (P value = 0.01) in the gabapentin group but not in lamotrigine-treated patients. The Whelan and Speake Rating Scale measuring challenging behaviour showed that gabapentin was similar to lamotrigine, with both drugs reducing the level of challenging behaviour as a total score over the duration of the trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK> showed that there was no significant difference between the topiramate and placebo-treated groups in the mean total EOS (Epilepsy Outcome Scale) scores, mean total ABC (Aberrant Behaviour Checklist) or mean total ELDQOL (Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life) scores. There was, however, a trend toward significance for improvement of the mean ELDQOL behaviour subscale score for patients treated with topiramate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK> noted in their study a clear difference in behaviour and alertness between the lamotrigine-treated patients and the placebo-treated patients, even without concomitant seizure reduction. No new data are available for this update.</P>

The adverse event most often resulting in withdrawal from the study was vomiting.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 1993</LINK> reported that adverse events were similar in patients treated with felbamate or placebo.

<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1991</LINK> reported no significant adverse events in the 13 patients completing the trial; however, seven patients were withdrawn during the trial, one due to drowsiness, probably related to the drug. The authors do not state whether the patients were taking the drug or placebo when the withdrawals occurred.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> found that the incidence of all adverse events was 62% (24) in the gabapentin group and 50% (22) in the lamotrigine group. Drug-related adverse events were 33% (13) in the gabapentin group and 25% (11) in the lamotrigine group. Ten per cent of patients (four) in the gabapentin group and 11% (five) in the lamotrigine group experienced serious adverse events and 8% of patients (three) and 9% (four) were withdrawn due to adverse events in the gabapentin and lamotrigine groups, respectively. One patient on gabapentin was withdrawn due to vomiting (considered to be probably drug-related); three patients on lamotrigine were withdrawn due to rash and peripheral oedema. One patient treated with gabapentin died due to myocardial infarction but this was not considered to be study drug-related.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK> found that there were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of adverse events except for colds or viral illnesses, which were more common in the lamotrigine group (p = 0.05) compared with the placebo group. Only adverse events reported by four or more patients in either treatment group were listed. Three patients in the lamotrigine group and seven in the placebo group withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The adverse event most frequently responsible for withdrawal was clinical deterioration of seizure control (one in the lamotrigine group, six in the placebo group). Seven patients in the lamotrigine group (9%) and six in the placebo group (7%) reported a rash that led to the withdrawal of two lamotrigine-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient, all of whom were also receiving valproate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK> found that no adverse effects were reported during the lamotrigine phase in the double-blind period. When receiving placebo during the double-blind phase 10 patients complained of fatigue and four had more severe seizures. No withdrawals were reported due to adverse events.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> showed that 23% of topiramate-treated patients had severe adverse events, compared with 10% of the placebo-treated patients. Three patients in the placebo group and nine in the topiramate-treated group experienced at least one adverse event that required either a dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of treatment. These adverse events included nervousness, personality disorder, nausea, arthrosis, rash and urinary incontinence in the placebo group and gait abnormality, fatigue, pallor, aggression, personality disorder, somnolence and agitation in the topiramate group. However, no patient discontinued the study due to an adverse event.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK> found that 92% in the topiramate group reported adverse events and 84% in the placebo group. Adverse events were recorded if they were reported in 5% or more of all patients. Serious adverse events were reported by 16% (six) in the topiramate group, possibly drug-related in four cases. Eleven per cent (four) in the placebo group reported serious adverse events, considered to be drug-related in one individual. The number of patients reporting at least one adverse event leading to a permanent stop in study medication was 18.9% (seven) in the topiramate group and 16.2% (six) in the placebo group. One patient died in the active group following hospitalisation with increasing drowsiness and confusion. This was reported as likely to be associated with the drug by the investigator.</P>

Adverse effects that were more common in clobazam groups than placebo groups (10% or more difference) were somnolence, pyrexia, lethargy, drooling and constipation. They reported that somnolence and drooling increased in frequency with clobazam dosage. Yamatogi 1997 reported drowsiness, dizziness and vomiting in 41.7% of patients in the clobazam group and in 57.5% in the clonazepam group. Fourteen patients were withdrawn from the study, only two due to drug adverse events of clonazepam.</P>

The Epilepsy Outcome Scale (EOS, a measure of quality of life specific to epilepsy and intellectual disability) showed no significant difference (P value = 0.856) between the topiramate-treated group and the placebo-treated group in the mean total EOS score or in any of the subscales. The ELDQOL (Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life) scale also showed no significant difference in the total mean score, however a trend towards significance for improvement of the mean ELDQOL behaviour subscale score was found for topiramate-treated patients (P value = 0.08).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-02 11:07:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this study was to assess the data available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antiepileptic drug interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. This review includes a total of 14 RCTs, which comprised data from 1116 participants.</P>
<P>In terms of retention on treatment, only one study reported the time at which dropouts occurred. The majority of studies, however, did report the number of dropouts. The frequency of dropouts varied considerably across the included studies with dropouts in the intervention groups ranging from 0% to 24.3%.</P>
<P>Three studies assessed the efficacy of lamotrigine: two studies used a placebo group as a comparator (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK>), and one study compared lamotrigine against gabapentin (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK> concluded that the use of lamotrigine as an adjunctive intervention to existing drug regimes is both well tolerated and produces a positive clinical response in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> concluded that the use of lamotrigine in this population is an effective antiepileptic medication comparable to gabapentin. One study found that topiramate used as an adjunctive intervention is well tolerated and can have a significant positive clinical response in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability (<LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK>). Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK> found a similar trend for adjunctive topiramate intervention in seizure reduction, however this result did not reach significance. Two studies found that clobazam was an effective adjunctive intervention for people with epilepsy and intellectual disability compared with a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2011</LINK>), and compared with clonazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Yamatogi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yamatogi 1997</LINK>). Although one study suggested that flunarizine, used as an adjunctive therapy, showed a tendency to produce lower seizure incidence, neither study assessing the effectiveness of flunarizine as an adjunctive intervention found any significant beneficial effect in reducing seizure frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gigli-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gigli 1988</LINK>). One study found no significant effect of cinromide compared with a placebo in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability (<LINK REF="STD-Crumrine-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crumrine 1989</LINK>). The results from one study showed that rufinamide, used as an adjunctive intervention, was well tolerated and efficacious in people with epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK>). One study compared the efficacy of carbamazepine against slow-release carbamazepine and concluded that reducing the fluctuation in serum concentrations may also reduce seizure frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Kaski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kaski 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 1993</LINK> concluded that felbamate can be beneficial to patients with epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1999</LINK> found that felbamate combined with valproic acid may be synergistic in reducing seizure frequency, although they did acknowledge that the reduction in seizure is in part due to the increased doses of valproic acid.</P>
<P>With respect to the effect of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the population of people with learning disability, overall the studies indicate relatively good efficacy. Seizure freedom was achieved in some patients. We combined incidence data for seizure frequency in AED groups compared with placebo groups from two studies and the results suggested a trend in favour of the AED intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 1993</LINK>). However, this result was not significant. We combined data for responder rates for overall seizure frequency (&#8805; 50% reduction in overall seizure frequency) from four studies in a meta-analysis and the results suggested that AEDs produced significantly higher rates of responders than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK>). We combined data for responder rates for drop seizures (&#8805; 50% reduction in drop seizure frequency) from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK>). However, although there was a trend in favour of AEDs over placebo, this result was not significant. Six out of ten studies recording seizure reduction in comparison to baseline showed a benefit of the drug compared with placebo; <LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2011</LINK> showed a significant decrease in seizures in the treatment group compared with placebo; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1991</LINK> showed a decrease but this was not statistically significant. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK> also showed a significant reduction in the frequency of tonic-clonic seizures between the rufinamide and placebo-treated groups. Of the remaining three studies, <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> showed equivalence between the active drug and comparator, <LINK REF="STD-Yamatogi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yamatogi 1997</LINK> showed a significantly higher seizure reduction in the clobazam-treated group compared with the comparator (clonazepam), whilst <LINK REF="STD-Crumrine-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crumrine 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK> showed no significant difference between drug (cinromide and topiramate, respectively) and placebo groups.</P>
<P>Of the four cross-over studies comparing the active drug to placebo, three showed positive improvements; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1998</LINK> found lamotrigine to be significantly more effective than placebo, <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1999</LINK> also showed total seizure frequency and drop attacks to be significantly reduced in the felbamate group compared with placebo and <LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1991</LINK> showed that there was a lower total seizure incidence during the flunarizine period in comparison to placebo in five out of 13 patients but that this difference was not statistically significant. However, <LINK REF="STD-Gigli-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gigli 1988</LINK> demonstrated no significant differences in seizure frequency between flunarizine and placebo groups (although no p values were reported). The cross-over study carried out by <LINK REF="STD-Kaski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kaski 1991</LINK> was an active comparator study and showed equivalence in seizure frequency between carbamazepine and slow-release carbamazepine during the early phase of the study but during the last two weeks the seizure frequency was significantly lower during the comparator treatment phase.</P>
<P>The effect of AEDs on seizure severity showed that of the five studies reporting this outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Crumrine-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crumrine 1989</LINK> failed to show a difference between the treatment and placebo group and <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK> showed that there was no significant difference between the drug and placebo groups. However, both <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> showed significant improvement in seizure severity in the treatment groups. Following the recent review, we identified that the study by <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK> showed an improvement in seizure severity and a higher 50% responder rate for total and tonic-atonic seizures in the rufinamide-treated arm compared with placebo.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> reported significant improvements in behavioural outcomes for both the active drug and comparator drug, however the validity of the rating scales used cannot be verified in the literature. <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK>, using validated rating scales, showed that there was no significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups.</P>
<P>Quality of life measures were only recorded in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2005</LINK>) and showed no significant differences between the drug and placebo-treated groups.</P>
<P>The incidence of adverse events reported in participants taking rufinamide was 81.1%. This was similar to the rate of adverse events reported in the placebo group in the same study. Three studies reported the rate of adverse events in felbamate groups. One study reported a similar rate of adverse events in both the felbamate and placebo groups. One of three studies involving felbamate indicated a possible increase in serious adverse events in the treatment group compared with placebo, although the total number of adverse events was comparable between the groups. In two studies, no adverse events were reported in participants taking felbamate, however the laboratory outcomes of one study indicated that it may be associated with a decrease in the white blood cell count. The incidence of adverse events in the gabapentin group was reported by one study and indicated a rate of 33% of drug-related adverse events, 10% of which were considered serious, compared with an incidence of 25% in the lamotrigine group, 11% of which were considered serious. A separate study involving lamotrigine reported greater withdrawals due to adverse events in the placebo group compared with patients taking lamotrigine. Both studies involving topiramate recorded adverse events although the rates were variable, ranging from 23% to 92% for the topiramate groups and from 10% to 84% for the placebo groups. Both studies indicate a slightly higher incidence of adverse events in the treatment groups. The higher rates were reported within the same study, which may reflect the criteria they used for reporting adverse events. Both studies involving clobazam reported adverse events. One study reported rates ranging from 72.4% to 88.7% in the treatment group and 67.8% in the placebo group. A separate study reported the incidence rate of adverse events in the clobazam group to be 41.7%, compared with 57.5% in the clonazepam group. Therefore, the rates of adverse events in the clobazam group were elevated compared with placebo but lower compared with clonazepam. No adverse events were recorded in the studies involving flunarizine, cinromide or carbamazepine. Included studies adopted various methods to record adverse events, which may explain some variability between the rates of adverse events across the studies. Without the use of a standardised means to record adverse events, there is poor consistency between studies in categorising and recording adverse events.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:42:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the present review we identified only 14 RCTs from our literature search, which illustrates how under-investigated this patient population is with regards to pharmacological interventions for epilepsy. The reasons for this paucity may be multifactorial, including the difficulty in obtaining informed consent, co-medication and adherence to the study protocol. This is a difficult area of research but the production of these 14 studies does demonstrate that relevant evaluative research is feasible.</P>
<P>The main focus of this review was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of pharmacological interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. To assess this with the limited number of studies, we pooled and compared all pharmacological interventions with placebo groups. Whilst this provides some evidence of the benefits of pharmacological interventions compared to placebo groups, it fails to address the relative effectiveness of each AED separately and therefore offers no information regarding which pharmacological intervention is most beneficial within this population.</P>
<P>As a result of the variable designs, small sample sizes and high dropout rates in some studies, analysis and therefore the reliability of the results is limited and few clinically relevant conclusions can be drawn from this review.</P>

<P>Despite not being able to draw robust conclusions from the present review, the results suggest that pharmacological interventions are effective in reducing seizure frequency in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. As discussed, refractory epilepsy is common in people with intellectual disability. This is consistent with other Cochrane reviews, which have found that lamotrigine (<LINK REF="REF-Ramaratnam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramaratnam 2001</LINK>), clobazam (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2008</LINK>), gabapentin (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Bachari-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Bachari 2013</LINK>), and topiramate (<LINK REF="REF-Pulman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulman 2014</LINK>) are effective interventions for refractory epilepsy. However, each of the previous reviews also identified a paucity of high quality RCTs and therefore meta-analysis was not possible.</P>
<P>Contrary to the findings of the present review, a previous Cochrane review identified three RCTs assessing the effectiveness of felbamate in refractory epilepsy, two of which found no significant benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2014</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:42:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the initial version of this review we identified one additional study relevant to this topic but the previous conclusions remain the same. Professionals in the field of epilepsy see numerous people with epilepsy and intellectual disability in need of treatment change. This review shows that in the majority of cases where antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were trialled in this population, moderate reduction in seizure frequency and occasional seizure freedom were obtained. It seems reasonable to say, in general, that AEDs with proven effectiveness in the general epilepsy population are also effective in refractory epilepsy in people with intellectual disability.</P>
<P>It is not possible to comment on the relative efficacy of medications, making clinical choice decisions difficult.</P>
<P>Clinical decisions are often guided by concern over adverse events. This is particularly pertinent for people with complex co-morbidity who are often in supported care environments. It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from this review due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity. However, from the limited evidence provided by this review, it appears that the adverse events experienced by people with epilepsy and intellectual disability are similar to those reported within the general population.</P>
<P>One key area of concern is that of behavioural exacerbation. The majority of studies are unhelpful due to their lack of or unreliable measures in this area. However, where measured, little obvious impact on behaviour was seen in terms of behaviour disorder.</P>
<P>In summary, the review offers tentative support for the use of AEDs to reduce seizure frequency in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Additionally, the evidence presented in this review suggests that the adverse events are similar to those known to affect the general population. In this review we pooled all AEDs together, therefore it is difficult to differentiate the effectiveness of each AED individually.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-20 08:42:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Key areas for research have been identified by this review.</P>
<P>There is a lack of data on many interventions. Neither the efficacy of newer AEDs such as levetiracetam, pregabalin, tiagabine and zonisamide, or older AEDs such as sodium valproate, have been investigated in this population in terms of seizure reduction or safety.</P>
<P>The issue of behavioural and cognitive safety is of concern to patients, carers and professionals, but has been inadequately investigated for the majority of AEDs. Investigators often used unreliable or no measures for assessment. Specific studies to investigate behavioural and cognitive safety are needed for this population.</P>
<P>Access to research is also an issue. The vast majority of studies recruit small numbers and this is compounded by the paucity of studies in general. The research community and its funders need to redress this imbalance positively through recognition of recruitment and access difficulties in this population.</P>
