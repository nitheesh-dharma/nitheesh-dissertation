<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Substantive amendment.</P>
<P>Since the previous version of this review, the results of a large North American trial of cephalexin versus placebo have been published (Stutman 2002). The authors have made further data available, allowing us to evaluate the effect of prophylaxis on conventional lung function tests, number of people receiving additional antibiotics, days of additional treatment and adverse effects. This further data also allows pooling of data on the following outcome measures: number of people admitted to hospital, duration of admission, isolates <I>S. aureus</I>, and isolates of <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. Our earlier findings of a beneficial effect on the number of children with one or more isolates of <I>S. aureus</I>, are confirmed. There is no significant difference in the number of isolates of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> between groups, though there is a trend towards fewer children with one or more isolates of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection, with prophylaxis, in years two and three and a similar trend towards more children with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> from years four to six.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We have received individual patient data on 109 children at two-year follow up who were enrolled in the Wales and West Midlands neonatal screening study (reported by Chatfield 1991). The published report did not include analysis by allocation to the prophylaxis or intermittent treatment group. We have now gone back to the original data and undertaken this analysis. This has allowed pooling of data on the following outcome measures: nutrition, isolates of common pathogens, isolates of <I>P. aeruginosa,</I> number of children admitted to hospital, and duration of admission. Our earlier findings of a beneficial effect of prophylaxis on the frequency of isolation of <I>S. aureus</I> from upper respiratory secretions are confirmed. Pooled data demonstrate no effect on nutrition. There is a non-significant trend towards a lower prevalence of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection with prophylaxis.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-05 09:00:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and adverse effects of giving regular antibiotics to people with cystic fibrosis to prevent infection with a germ called <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis blocks the airways with mucus and causes frequent airway infections. These can lead to death from breathing failure. People with cystic fibrosis are sometimes given regular antibiotics to prevent infections from a germ called <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>. However, antibiotics can also have adverse effects such as oral thrush or diarrhoea. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 29 September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review includes four studies with 401 children; there were no adult studies. The children were put into groups at random and received either an oral antibiotic continuously as a prevention for at least one year or no antibiotic treatment to prevent infection with <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>. All children could be given additional antibiotics if their doctor thought they needed them, based on symptoms and germs grown in their respiratory secretions. Studies lasted for a maximum of six years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found some evidence that giving regular antibiotics to young children (continued up to six years of age) leads to fewer infections with <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>. For other outcomes in the review, there was no difference between giving regular antibiotics or not. Since none of the studies lasted longer than six years, we can't draw any conclusions about long-term use. Also, since all studies were in children, we can not comment on the use of these drugs in adults. Future research should look at patterns of antibiotic resistance and survival.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All the studies were of variable quality and the quality of the evidence for different outcomes ranged from low to moderate. We judged that the two older studies had a higher risk of bias overall compared to the two newer studies. In particular this was because those taking part in the studies (or their parents or caregivers) would be able to guess which treatment they were receiving, and also one study did not state if anyone had dropped out and if so what the reasons were. Only the newest study seemed to be free of bias, although even here we were not certain if the study results were affected by the way the data were analysed. Further research might change the estimate of the size of the treatment effect and would certainly affect our confidence in the estimated effect.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:41:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> causes pulmonary infection in young children with cystic fibrosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed hoping to prevent such infection and lung damage. Antibiotics have adverse effects and long-term use might lead to infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-20 14:12:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To assess continuous oral antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> versus no prophylaxis in people with cystic fibrosis, we tested these hypotheses. Prophylaxis:<BR/>1. improves clinical status, lung function and survival;<BR/>2. causes adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, skin rash, candidiasis);<BR/>3. leads to fewer isolates of common pathogens from respiratory secretions;<BR/>4. leads to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and colonisation of the respiratory tract with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-04-11 09:30:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Companies manufacturing anti-staphylococcal antibiotics were contacted.</P>
<P>Most recent search of the Group's Register: 29 September 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-11-20 14:12:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomised trials of continuous oral prophylactic antibiotics (given for at least one year) compared to intermittent antibiotics given 'as required', in people with cystic fibrosis of any disease severity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The authors assessed studies for eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-11 09:31:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We included four studies, with a total of 401 randomised participants aged zero to seven years on enrolment; one study is ongoing. The two older included studies generally had a higher risk of bias across all domains, but in particular due to a lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data, than the two more recent studies. We only regarded the most recent study as being generally free of bias, although even here we were not certain of the effect of the per protocol analysis on the study results. Evidence was downgraded based on GRADE assessments and outcome results ranged from moderate to low quality. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes); for imprecision (number of people needing additional antibiotics); and for inconsistency (weight z score).</P>
<P>Fewer children receiving anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis had one or more isolates of <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between groups in infant or conventional lung function (moderate quality evidence). We found no significant effect on nutrition (low quality evidence), hospital admissions, additional courses of antibiotics (low quality evidence) or adverse effects (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the number of isolates of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> between groups (low quality evidence), though there was a trend towards a lower cumulative isolation rate of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in the prophylaxis group at two and three years and towards a higher rate from four to six years. As the studies reviewed lasted six years or less, conclusions cannot be drawn about the long-term effects of prophylaxis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis leads to fewer children having isolates of <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, when commenced early in infancy and continued up to six years of age. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Further research may establish whether the trend towards more children with CF with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, after four to six years of prophylaxis, is a chance finding and whether choice of antibiotic or duration of treatment might influence this.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-11 09:35:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-04 11:32:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-04-04 11:31:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterised by abnormal mucociliary clearance, primarily affecting the respiratory tract and the gut. Poor clearance of respiratory secretions and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infection lead to chronic inflammation and structural airway damage. Most deaths from CF are due to end-stage respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kerem-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerem 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bacterial infection due to <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<I>S aureus</I>) may be found in CF infants as early as three months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1995</LINK>) and can be accompanied by evidence of inflammation and abnormal lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Pillarisetti-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillarisetti 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-04-04 11:32:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Most CF centres treat people with CF with antibiotics when they are symptomatic, guided by the results of recent specimens of respiratory secretions. Many will also collect sputum or 'cough swab' specimens routinely and prescribe antibiotics if a pathogen, such as <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>(<I>P aeruginosa</I>), is found even if the person is asymptomatic. It is the practice in some CF centres to give continuous anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis to people with CF from diagnosis through early childhood.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-04 11:32:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The aim of prophylactic antibiotic use in this population is to reduce infection with <I>S aureus </I>and inflammation in the developing lung and to slow the onset of bronchiectasis. However, prophylactic antibiotics may be associated with earlier age at acquisition of <I>P aeruginosa </I>as well as adverse effects such as diarrhoea or oral candidiasis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-29 03:44:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is significant debate globally regarding the role of anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis in young children with CF, with guidelines varying widely by country based on differing views of the risks versus benefits. This is an update of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>To assess the effect on the outcome in young children with CF, of continuous oral antibiotic prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of <I>S aureus</I>. The following hypotheses were tested to investigate whether antibiotic prophylaxis:</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-04 11:38:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In the current version of the review, we assessed the risk of bias to each included study relative to six domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias) as recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If the generation of allocation sequence or concealment of that sequence was deemed to be adequate, then we judged the study to have a low risk of bias. If these were deemed to be inadequate, then we judged the study to have a potential risk of bias. If these were unclear, then the risk of bias for the study was also unclear. For blinding, the risk of bias was judged to increase as the number of people blinded to the intervention decreased. We also deemed there to be a risk of bias if there were any withdrawals or drop outs from the study which were not accounted for and explained, or if there were an unequal number of drop outs from a particular intervention group. We planned to examine the protocol for each included study where possible to establish whether results from any outcomes measured were selectively reported. Where protocols were not available, we compared the 'Methods' sections of the published papers to the 'Results' sections and also used clinical experience to judge whether they would expect outcomes to be measured as 'standard'. If we identified any outcomes that had been clearly measured but not reported, we judged there to be a high risk of bias; if all outcomes measured were clearly reported, we judged there to be a low risk of bias; if it was not clear if outcomes may have been measured and not reported, we judged there to be an unclear risk of bias. Finally, we assessed the studies for any other potential sources of bias, again judging there to be a high risk of bias if any sources were identified, a low risk of bias if it was clear that there were no other sources of bias and an unclear risk of bias if we were not able to judge this without any doubts.</P>

<P>We calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect across all studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we presented the the odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Dichotomous outcomes include: acquisition of <I>S aureus</I>, survival, hospitalisation, requirement for additional antibiotics, acquisition of additional pathogens (including resistant <I>S aureus</I>), and presence of any adverse events. For continuous outcome data, we calculated the mean difference between treatment groups with corresponding 95% CIs. Continuous outcomes include: lung function tests, growth, number of days in hospital, number of days of additional antibiotics and quality of life. For one study, adverse events were presented as the number of days with a range of adverse events and we analysed these as continuous data. For longitudinal data, we undertook analysis at six months and thereafter at yearly intervals from diagnosis.</P>

We determined the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach; and downgraded evidence in the presence of a high risk of bias in at least one study, indirectness of the evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results and a high probability of publication bias.

<P>The four included studies enrolled a total of 401 children and provided data from a total of 305 children (144 boys) who completed treatment per protocol (randomised to receive either prophylactic antibiotics or no prophylaxis). The number of participants enrolled in each study ranged from 28 (<LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>) to 209 (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). Dropout rates were generally low, except in the Stutman study where 90 out of 209 participants withdrew (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). In one study of neonatal screening (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>), many clinicians declined to randomise infants presenting with meconium ileus (27 infants).</P>
<P>All studies recruited paediatric participants, but the ages at enrolment differed. Two studies were linked to newborn screening programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). The youngest participants were in the Weaver study; the mean age at enrolment was seven weeks in the prophylaxis group and five weeks in the 'as required' group (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). In the Chatfield study, the mean age was 122 days in the prophylaxis group and 260 in the 'as required' group (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>). Participants in the Stutman study were older; 15.6 months in the antibiotic group and 14.1 months in the placebo group at enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>).

Two studies used flucloxacillin in both the prophylactic and the 'as required' treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>); Weaver further stated that the dose given prophylactically was 125 mg twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). Schlesinger used a cycle of antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, cefadroxil and dicloxacillin), with changes being made every three months, versus the same drugs being used intermittently (<LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>). Stutman compared continuous daily cephalexin (80 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day in three equally divided doses) to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In each of these studies additional antibiotics could be prescribed to children in both arms of the study. In the Stutman study, children who received an additional antibiotic stopped their prophylaxis temporarily and, if additional treatment was required for more than six weeks, the participant was withdrawn (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>).</P>

Of 209 children recruited, 90 children withdrew; 119 completed the study, of which 68 were in the prophylaxis group and 51 in the placebo group. When children were withdrawn, this was most commonly at the parents' request, due to "the rigors of the study". They also analysed data on those completing at least one year of the study, although this does not constitute a formal intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Lung function</HEADING>
<P>Stutman used conventional tests of lung function, measured at the end of follow-up (six years) in 119 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). They found no significant difference between prophylaxis and placebo for FEV&#8321; (% predicted) or FVC (% predicted) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infant lung function was measured by Beardsmore in the Weaver study, which looked at infants enrolled in the newborn period (<LINK REF="REF-Beardsmore-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beardsmore 1994</LINK>). They aimed to measure lung function shortly after diagnosis (achieved in 19 infants receiving prophylaxis and 18 on 'as required' treatment) and again at one year (achieved in 18 infants receiving prophylaxis and 17 on 'as required' treatment). Specialised tests of lung function (not in routine clinical practice) were used, namely: thoracic gas volume (TGV); airway conductance (Gaw); maximum flow at functional residual capacity (Vmax FRC). The study authors reported no significant difference in infant lung function between the two regimens at either age. The results were expressed as scores (the number of standard errors by which the participant's value differed from a predicted value). For the mean values of scores, please refer to the additional table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Number of people with one or more isolates of <I>S aureus</I> (sensitive strains)</HEADING>
<P>The Weaver study reported the number of children in whom an organism was found and the number of months when there were positive isolates (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). However, the methods section does not specify how often routine samples were taken. For the sake of clarity and comparability, the data presented in '<LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>' show the number of children with at least one isolate of <I>S aureus</I>. Pooled data from the Chatfield, Stutman and Weaver studies were used and are presented by years in the study from one to six years (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). These data show significantly fewer children with one or more isolates of <I>S aureus</I> (at any time from the start of the study) in the group receiving prophylaxis for every year of follow up: at one year (n = 315), OR 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.48); at two years (n = 260), OR 0.21 (95% 0.13 to 0.35); at three years (n = 127), OR 0.22 (95% 0.13 to 0.38); at four years (n = 127), OR 0.10 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.25); at five years (n = 98), OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.26); and at six years (n = 43), OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.46) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). At the three-year time point we note the substantial level of heterogeneity (I² = 70%) which might be linked to the age at diagnosis; the Chatfield study was linked to a neonatal screening programme and the Stutman study enrolled infants and young children diagnosed up to two years of age.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Growth</HEADING>
<P>Four studies measured children's growth (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). Schlesinger reported the weight for age SD score (z score) after 12 months and found a statistically significant difference in favour of the children receiving prophylaxis; the statistical test used and the level of significance were not stated (<LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>). The results from the Schlesinger study could not be presented graphically as the SDs were not given. Stutman and colleagues gave mean weight and height in each group, at the end of six years follow up (no significant difference) (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). However, SD scores were not given.</P>
<P>Weaver recorded weight for age and length for age SD scores at six months, one year and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). Chatfield recorded the same SD scores at one, two and three years (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>). The results for the one- and two-year assessment have therefore been combined. The combined data from the two studies did not find a statistically significant difference in either the weight for age or the length for age SD scores, in favour of either regimen, at either the one- or two-year time points (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The SD scores at six months and three years, for the individual studies, are also presented in '<LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>'. Again, there was no significant difference in favour of either regimen. Length is difficult to measure accurately in this age group.</P>
<P>We note the substantial heterogeneity present when data from the Chatfield and Weaver studies for weight for age z score are combined at both one year (I² = 64%) and two years (I² = 81%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). We have considered possible reasons for this heterogeneity and are unable to explain it, although we judge the Weaver study to be more methodologically robust.</P>

These data have therefore not been presented in graphical form. Additional antibiotic treatment was not reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). There was no significant difference between groups for either the number of children receiving additional antibiotics (n = 119) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) or for the mean number of days received per child (n = 119) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). </P>

<P>This was not reported by Schlesinger (<LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>). When the results of the Chatfield, Stutman and Weaver studies were combined, there were no significant differences between groups for this outcome (n = 315) (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). However, the results suggest that this outcome may depend on the duration of treatment. As shown in the graph, after two and three years of treatment there was a trend towards fewer isolates of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in the treatment group, but at years four, five and six the trend was towards fewer isolates of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-05 09:27:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We present data on 305 participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) from four studies, three of which compared a prophylactic antibiotic regimen to an 'as required' regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>) and one which compared a continuous antibiotic regimen to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regards to the review's first primary outcome, lung function, the Stutman study was the only one to measure conventional spirometry and found no difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV&#8321;) % predicted or forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted between the active and placebo arms after six years of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). Similarly, the Beardsmore report from the Weaver study, using infant pulmonary function tests, found antibiotic prophylaxis has no significant effect on infant lung function over a one-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Beardsmore-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beardsmore 1994</LINK>). In terms of the second primary outcome, isolation of <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<I>S aureus</I>) from respiratory cultures, data from all four included studies indicate that fewer children in the group receiving continuous anti-staphylococcal prophylaxis had one or more isolates of <I>S aureus </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of the review's secondary outcome measures, data are presented for a number of clinical outcome measures: nutrition; Shwachman score; and Chrispin-Norman chest radiograph score. Nutritional data are available from three eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). One study suggested an improvement in weight for age standard deviation score in the prophylaxis group after one year of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>). This study could not be combined with the other two studies reporting standard deviation scores (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). The pooled data from the studies of Chatfield and Weaver show no significant difference in weight for age or height for age standard deviation scores between regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). The Chatfield study provides data up to three years, again with no significant difference seen. This may be because this study looked at young children who are still showing rapid 'catch up' growth (<LINK REF="REF-Morison-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morison 1997</LINK>), whereas the participants studied by Schlesinger may have already achieved this 'catch up' in weight. Alternatively, this negative result may be because there is no therapeutic effect. The data from the Chatfield study showed no significant difference in Shwachman or Chrispin-Norman scores between the two regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one death was reported in one of the eligible studies, so no conclusions can be drawn about the likely effects of prophylaxis on survival. Mortality is likely to be very low in the young children studied and during such a short follow-up period.</P>
<P>The requirement for additional antibiotics and hospital admission may be thought of as indirect measures of clinical status, although both these measures will be influenced by local treatment protocols and clinicians' preferences. The use of additional antibiotics is also a potential confounding factor. Admissions to hospital may also have a negative effect on the quality of life of the child and their family. The pooled data show no significant difference in additional antibiotics or hospital admissions between groups.</P>
<P>We found no significant difference in the isolation rate of other common organisms (such as <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> and <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>) between the prophylaxis and 'as required' groups. Although there was no significant difference between groups in the number of children having one or more isolates of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>), there was a trend towards fewer affected children in years two and three of the study and a similar trend to more children having at least one isolate of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in years four to six. The data from the years four to six all come from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>), as none of the other studies had more than three years of follow up. These trends may be a chance finding. However, if the trend to more children having <I>P aeruginosa </I>with a longer duration of prophylaxis is a genuine finding, then this is a cause for concern. There are two possible explanations: firstly, a period of prophylaxis of more than three years' duration predisposes to pseudomonas infection; or secondly, the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (cephalexin) rather than a narrow spectrum anti-staphylococcal antibiotic (flucloxacillin) promotes pseudomonas infection.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-01 12:39:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Reporting of the presence of organisms in the respiratory secretions is difficult to standardise, since prevalence is dependent on the frequency with which samples are taken. The eligible studies involved young children and so nose and throat swabs were used, rather than sputum samples. Armstrong showed that oropharyngeal specimens predict lower respiratory infection poorly (positive predictive value 41%) (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The eligible studies had a maximum follow-up period of six years and all the participants studied were under seven years of age. It is therefore important not to extrapolate these results to longer periods of prophylaxis or to older individuals. </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-04 13:24:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In common with other Cochrane authors (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1999</LINK>), we have found it difficult to establish whether the randomisation method used in many studies allows true concealment of allocation and therefore prevents bias. It is to be hoped that medical journals will increasingly follow the recommendations of the CONSORT statement on reporting the results of randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). One of the eligible studies included in this review by Schlesinger did not report withdrawals, making it impossible to determine whether intention-to-treat or per protocol analysis had been used (<LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 1984</LINK>). The two citations of the Weaver study contained discrepancies in the number of participants in prophylaxis and 'as required' groups (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>). This suggests that data on lung function have been presented on some (but not all) of the participants who withdrew from the study. The Chatfield study has a number of methodological weaknesses (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>). There was a lack of proper randomisation of infants with meconium ileus, leading to their exclusion from our analysis. Neonatal screening was undertaken only on alternate weeks leading to a heterogeneous population, containing screened and unscreened infants, being randomised to prophylaxis or intermittent treatment. Data were not available on every child in the study at each time point of follow-up. This has led to data on different numbers of children being reported at different time points, e.g. data for weight and length standard deviation score at one, two and three years (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). This is a potential source of bias. The Stutman study was methodologically superior in having a clear description of concealment of allocation, allocation sequence generation, and double-blinded placebo-controlled design (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). However, even in this study, a formal intention-to-treat analysis was not possible due to a lack of outcome data on those children who were withdrawn.</P>
<P>Overall the number of studies is small, and those studies which have been undertaken are of poor quality, with small numbers of participants. The effect on <I>S aureus</I> is likely to be genuine, as it is seen in all three studies with data, when taken individually and when they are combined in the meta-analysis. It is also consistent at all time points up to six years. However, the lack of a beneficial effect of prophylaxis on any outcome measure other than <I>S aureus</I> may be genuine or due to insufficient statistical power, bias or the 'lumping' together of different regimens. The data on <I>Paeruginosa</I> must be interpreted with caution, as there was no statistically significant difference between regimens. Data for this outcome measure for years four to six came from the Stutman study alone, where attrition may have led to bias (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). The Stutman study was the only study to report on adverse effects and uncommon adverse effects may be missed in randomised trials because of the small numbers involved (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>). Based on GRADE criteria, the overall strength of the evidence is moderate to low. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes); for imprecision (number of people needing additional antibiotics); and for inconsistency (weight z score).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-11 09:35:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-04-11 09:35:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Our review includes four studies of anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis in children with CF, with data from 305 participants. The quality of studies is concerning, with important deficiencies in each. Significantly fewer children with CF will have one or more isolates of <I>S aureus</I> in upper respiratory secretions when anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis is prescribed for the first six years of life. However, the importance of this finding is uncertain, as this review has not shown that this is associated with an improvement in clinical outcome measures. The currently available evidence does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the effect of prophylaxis on acquisition of <I>P aeruginosa</I>. There is no significant difference in the rate of common adverse effects.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence in this review to say whether the use of anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis in older children or adults is beneficial or harmful. Hence, clinicians should exercise caution, if prophylactic anti-staphylococcal antibiotics are used in older individuals or for longer periods.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-05 09:31:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The four studies included in this review had important methodologic limitations, including small sample size and high risk of bias. Thus, important questions regarding the benefits and risks of staphylococcal prophylaxis remain unanswered, including long-term clinical benefit and risk of earlier acquisition of <I>P aeruginosa</I>. A prospective, multicentre randomized clinical trial comparing continuous flucloxacillin and "as required" antibiotic therapy in infants identified by newborn screening is underway in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-CF-START-2016" TYPE="STUDY">CF START 2016</LINK>) (for further details see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). Additional or future clinical trials, particularly with a placebo arm, would greatly strengthen the evidence base for or against anti-staphylococcal prophylaxis in people with CF.</P>

Although this was not an a priori hypothesis of this review, data from the Chatfield study are available for Shwachman and Chrispin-Norman scores at three years (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>). The Shwachman score is a clinical score which includes symptoms, clinical examination findings, nutrition and radiology (<LINK REF="REF-Shwachman-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shwachman 1958</LINK>).

<P>1. Downgraded once due to incomplete outcome data: outcomes were measured only in the children completing treatment per protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>).<BR/>2. Downgraded once due to applicability: nose and throat swabs were used to assess for infection, rather than sputum samples, which have been shown to poorly predict lower respiratory infection (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>).<BR/>3. Downgraded once due to risk of bias: studies contributing evidence were not blinded or had incomplete outcome data (or both) (<LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stutman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 1994</LINK>).<BR/>4. Downgraded once due to imprecision: only a small number of children did not require additional antibiotics; this small number has results in a wide confidence interval around the relative effect.<BR/>5.
