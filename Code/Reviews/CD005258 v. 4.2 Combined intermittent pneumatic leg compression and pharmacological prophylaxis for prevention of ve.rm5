<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are collectively known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), and occur when a blood clot develops inside the leg veins (DVT) and travels to the lungs (PE). They are possible complications of hospitalisation resulting from surgery or trauma. These complications extend hospital stay and are associated with long-term disability and death. Patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery or surgery for colorectal cancer are at high risk of venous thromboembolism. Sluggish venous blood flow, increased blood clotting and blood vessel wall injury are contributing factors. Treating more than one of these causes may improve prevention. Mechanical intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) reduces sluggish blood flow (venous stasis) while medications such as aspirin and anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin) reduce blood clotting. These medications are known as pharmacological prophylaxis (drugs used to prevent blood clots). However, these medications can also increase the risk of bleeding. This review is an update of a review first published in 2008.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 22 trials with a total of 9137 participants to include in this review (current until May 2016). The mean age of participants, where reported, was 65.2 years. Most participants had either a high-risk procedure or condition. The predisposing conditions were orthopedic surgery in 12 studies and urology, cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, trauma, general surgery, gynaecology or other types of participants in the remaining studies.</P>
<P>Compared to IPC alone, IPC plus medication did not show differences in the incidence (rate of new cases) of PE (12 studies with a total of 3017 participants). The incidence of DVT was reduced for IPC combined with medication when compared with IPC alone (11 studies with a total of 2934 participants). The addition of a medication to IPC, however, increased the risk for any bleeding compared to IPC alone, from 0.66% to 4.0%. Major bleeding followed a similar pattern, with an increase from 0.1% to 1.5%.Further analysis looking at different subgroups of participants (orthopedic and non-orthopedic participants) did not show any overall difference in DVT while it was not possible to assess differences between subgroups for PE.</P>
<P>Compared with medication alone, combined IPC and medication reduced the incidence of PE (10 studies with 3544 participants). DVT incidence was not different between the medication and the combined IPC and medication group (11 studies with 2866 participants). No differences were observed in rates of bleeding (three studies with 244 participants). Further analysis looking at different subgroups of participants did not show any overall difference in incidence of PE and DVT between orthopedic and non-orthopedic participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The findings of this review show moderate quality evidence and agree with current guideline recommendations supporting the use of combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis, compared with IPC or pharmacological prophylaxis alone, to reduce the incidence of DVT and PE in hospitalized patients. Moderate quality evidence suggests the addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC, increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed for IPC when added to pharmacological prophylaxis (very low quality evidence), as expected for a physical method for preventing blood clots. The quality of the evidence was downgraded from high to moderate or very low for risk of bias and imprecision and indirectness between the studies.</P>

<P>It is generally assumed by practitioners and guideline authors that combined modalities (methods of treatment) are more effective than single modalities in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or both.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>We included a total of 22 trials (9137 participants) of which 15 were randomized trials (7762 participants). The overall risk of bias was mostly unclear or high due to selection and performance bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and this was downgraded from high to moderate or very low due to the risk of bias, imprecision or indirectness.</P>
<P>The rate of PE in the studies comparing IPC alone with combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis was low, underpowering the analyses. The incidence of symptomatic PE was 0.79% with IPC, but ranged between 0.1 to 1% with combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.34; 12 studies, 3017 participants, moderate quality evidence). The incidence of DVT was 4.10% in the IPC group and 2.19% in the combined group showing a reduced incidence of DVT in favour of the combined group (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.82; 11 studies, 2934 participants, moderate quality evidence). The addition of an anticoagulant to IPC, however, increased the risk of any bleeding compared to IPC alone; 0.66% (7/1053) in the IPC group and 4.0% (44/1102) in the combined group (OR 5.04, 95% CI 2.36 to 10.77; 7 studies, 2155 participants, moderate quality evidence). Major bleeding followed a similar pattern; 0.1% (1/1053) in the IPC group to 1.5% (17/1102) in the combined group (OR 6.81, 95% CI 1.99 to 23.28; 7 studies, 2155 participants, moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>We detected no difference between the type of surgery subgroups such as orthopedic and non-orthopedic participants for DVT incidence (P = 0.16). Tests for differences between type of surgery subgroups were not possible for PE incidence.</P>
<P>Compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, the use of combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis modalities reduced the incidence of symptomatic PE from 2.92% to 1.20% (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.64; 10 studies, 3544 participants, moderate quality evidence). The incidence of DVT was 6.2% in the pharmacological prophylaxis group and 2.9% in the combined group showing no difference between the combined and pharmacological prophylaxis groups (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.03; 11 studies, 2866 participants, moderate quality evidence). Increased bleeding side effects were not observed for IPC when it was added to anticoagulation (bleeding: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.14, very low quality evidence; major bleeding: OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.18, very low quality evidence, 3 studies, 244 participants).</P>
<P>No difference was detected between the type of surgery subgroups for PE incidence (P = 0.68) or for DVT incidence (P = 0.10).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-31 08:25:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Moderate quality evidence suggests that combining IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis, compared with IPC or pharmacological prophylaxis alone, decreases the incidence of DVT when compared to compression, and incidence of PE when compared to anticoagulation. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is no difference between combined and single modalities in the incidence of PE when compared with compression alone and DVT when compared with anticoagulation alone. The quality of evidence for PE or DVT was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision or risk of bias in study methodology, highlighting the need for further research. Moderate quality evidence suggests the addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC, increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed for IPC when added to pharmacological prophylaxis (very low quality evidence), as expected for a physical method of thromboprophylaxis. The quality of evidence for bleeding was downgraded to moderate due to indirectness or very low due to risk of bias in study methodology, indirectness and imprecision highlighting the need for further research. Nevertheless, the results of the current review agree with current guideline recommendations, which support the use of combined modalities in hospitalised patients (limited to those with trauma or undergoing surgery) at risk of developing VTE. More studies on the role of combined modalities in VTE prevention are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), i.e. the development of thrombi inside the deep veins of the legs (in most instances), is a potentially fatal disease as it can be complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE), resulting from the movement of thrombi from the leg veins to the pulmonary artery or its branches. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT, PE or both, is still high despite the use of contemporary prophylactic measures. VTE risk is increased by the presence of certain risk factors, including, age, malignancy, immobilisation and the type of surgery. High-risk patients include those undergoing total hip or knee replacement, or surgery for colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2001</LINK>). Experts in the field have indicated that this and similar observations are the result of failed and also omitted prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhaber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhaber 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piazza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piazza 2007</LINK>). The most recent guidelines recommend combined pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis in high-risk groups, in an effort to maximize thromboprophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolaides-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolaides 2013</LINK>). It is likely that mechanical methods increase the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis and reduce death and morbidity rates without increasing bleeding risk.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) involves wrapping the legs with inflatable sleeves, using commercially available devices. As a result of sleeve inflation, external pressure is exerted on the legs and its veins, resulting in an increase in blood flow and this reduction of blood stasis decreases the incidence of VTE. Pharmacological prophylaxis on the other hand is achieved by mostly small doses of anticoagulants given orally or subcutaneously; these also significantly reduce the incidence of VTE. Combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis in the form of dual modalities concurrently used for prevention of VTE may improve the efficacy of each method used alone.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-21 18:42:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mechanical methods reduce VTE mainly by reducing venous stasis, while anticoagulants inhibit elements of the thrombosis cascade. Because single prophylactic modalities reduce but not completely eliminate VTE, combined modalities are expected to reduce further the frequency of VTE because of their different mechanisms of action.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Venous thromboembolism is the single most common, preventable cause of postoperative death. Better use of preventive resources is expected to reduce VTE events and mortality. Use of combined modalities is suggested by current guidelines in high risk patients, however the evidence supporting these recommendations requires better attention (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolaides-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolaides 2013</LINK>). We performed this review to assess the breadth and strength of the best available evidence by pooling data from multiple studies to overcome limitations of small and underpowered studies. This review is an update of a review first published in 2008.</P>

In addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) <A HREF="http://www.metaxis.com/CRSWeb/Index.asp">www.metaxis.com/CRSWeb/Index.asp</A> (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4)). See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of the search strategy used to search the CRS. The Specialised Register is maintained by the CIS and is constructed from weekly electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and through handsearching relevant journals. The full list of the databases, journals and conference proceedings which have been searched, as well as the search strategies used are described in the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html">Specialised Register</A> section of the Cochrane Vascular module in the Cochrane Library (<A HREF="http://www.cochranelibrary.com/">www.cochranelibrary.com</A>).</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Two review authors (SK and IN) independently selected studies for inclusion on the basis of use of combined mechanical IPC and pharmacological modalities. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>SKK and two co-authors (GG and IN) independently extracted the data. We used a data extraction form to record the type of patient or surgical procedure, total number of participants in the study (including those randomized, excluded and also withdrawn), the interventions used, the number of participants who reached an endpoint (DVT or PE) and the methodology used to establish this. A third author (JC) arbitrated any disagreements.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of all included studies using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. . SKK and two co-authors (GG and IN) independently performed the assessment according to <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. The following domains were assessed: selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective reporting) and other bias. We classified the domains as low risk, high risk, or unclear risk according to <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=988902011121051235&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>We performed separate analysis for the interventions of IPC versus combined modalities, and pharmacological prophylaxis versus combined modalities for the outcomes of PE and DVT. We used odds ratios (OR) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessment of dichotomous outcomes of all trials and RCTs only, respectively.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-06-08 10:37:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>We excluded studies with non-standard designs, such as cross-over trials and cluster-randomized trials. The individual patient was the unit of analysis.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-05-19 13:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>In case of missing participants due to drop-out, we used intention-to-treat analysis. Where necessary, we contacted study authors to request that they provided any missing information. </P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-19 09:19:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity with the I<SUP>2 </SUP>test. I<SUP>2</SUP> levels exceeding 50% were considered as substantial heterogeneity to justify the use of random-effects analysis.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-23 10:09:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed publication bias with funnel plots when 10 or more studies were included in a comparison and contributed to the effect estimate; as described by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. Where the number of studies in each comparison was not greater than 10 the plots lack the power to distinguish chance from real asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P> We used fixed-effect models for each meta-analysis to pool data, unless there was evidence of heterogeneity in which case we used a random-effects model to calculate the RR or ORs and 95% CIs (see <LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>)..</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-08-30 08:50:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed subgroup analysis of the primary outcomes for surgery type (e.g. orthopedic surgery, etc), type of DVT (symptomatic) and type of IPC (foot IPC and other than foot IPC).</P>
</SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS>
<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-07-19 09:20:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis of the primary outcomes by excluding studies with a high-risk for bias, based on the 'Risk of bias' tool, and by excluding CCTs, in order to test the robustness of the evidence. Where significant heterogeneity was present, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine what effect this had on the results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We created 'Summary of findings' tables for the comparisons of IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus IPC alone (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus pharmacological prophylaxis alone (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). We used GRADEpro GDT software (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=988902011121051235&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015">GRADEpro GDT 2015</A>) to present the main findings of the review. We included the primary outcomes DVT and PE and incidence of bleeding and major bleeding in the 'Summary of findings' tables. We calculated assumed control intervention risks from the mean number of events in the control groups of the selected studies for each outcome. The system developed by the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE working group) was used for grading the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low and very low, based on within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effects estimates, and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-31 08:17:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Our review showed that combined modalities are more effective than single modalities in reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) when compared to compression and incidence of pulmonary (PE) when compared to anticoagulation. Our review showed no difference between combined and single modalities in the incidence of PE when compared with compression alone and DVT when compared with anticoagulation alone. For PE this was likely caused by the low number of events and can be attributed to a type II error, i.e. an incorrect retention of the null hypothesis. The latter also applies to the studies that investigated the combination of compression plus anticoagulant with compression plus aspirin. However the quality of evidence for the research that supports these conclusions was judged to be moderate as a result of bias being present in several domains. The addition of an anticoagulant to IPC, however, increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed for IPC when added to anticoagulation, as indeed expected for a physical method of thromboprophylaxis. These findings highlight the need to tailor the use of additional pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in patients at low risk for bleeding or those where bleeding does not have catastrophic consequences. This issue deserves further study since the criteria for major bleeding were not uniform across the studies, with some of them reporting on blood loss during the procedures or through the drains nor providing rates for postoperative bleeding.</P>
<P>The mechanism responsible for the improved effectiveness of combined modalities may be attributed to the fact that DVT is a multifactorial process. Virchow in 1856 suggested that venous stasis, coagulopathy and endothelial injury are all causes of VTE (<LINK REF="REF-Virchow-1856" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virchow 1856</LINK>). By treating the different causes of VTE it is expected to improve efficacy in DVT prevention. Rosendaal more recently extended Virchow's theory by proposing a model of risk factors, which considered the importance of the additive role and interaction of multiple risk factors (multiple hit model) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosendaal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosendaal 1999</LINK>). Based on the additive role of mechanical and pharmacological modalities, the results of this review suggest that venous stasis and hypercoagulopathy are truly independent risk factors. IPC reduces venous stasis by producing active flow enhancement (<LINK REF="REF-Kakkos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkos 2005</LINK>), and also increases tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) plasma levels (<LINK REF="REF-Chouhan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouhan 1999</LINK>). Unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin inhibit factor X. These totally different mechanisms of action are most likely responsible for the synergy between these two modality types.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis confirmed the efficacy of adding compression to anticoagulation in DVT prevention in orthopedic participants, known to suffer from venous stasis, and also the efficacy of adding anticoagulation to compression in DVT prevention in non-orthopedic participants, known to have frequently hypercoagulation due to the presence of sepsis, malignancy or other reasons. However the studies were underpowered regarding the other comparisons and also for the outcome of PE, with the exception of the comparison combined modalities versus anticoagulation in non-orthopedic participants. Interestingly, some comparisons became significant after removing studies deemed to be high risk for bias, as presented in the results section of this review. Similarly, comparisons for symptomatic DVT were also underpowered and further studies may be required. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis of the comparison IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus pharmacological prophylaxis, restricted to IPCs other than foot IPCs was significantly in favor of the combined modalities, unlike the analysis of all IPCs combined, perhaps because the potentially less effective foot IPCs were not included.</P>
<P>Pulmonary embolism risk-reduction rates were mostly consistent across the studies with no heterogeneity, perhaps because symptomatic PE is a clinically significant complication. In contrast, some heterogeneity was noted in the results on DVT reduction, particularly in non-orthopedic participants. This might have been related to the fact that methodological quality of the assessed studies was low, with allocation concealment usually being unclear and performance bias usually being high. An alternative explanation is that the heterogeneity of the included participants who underwent various surgical procedures resulted in a variable risk of DVT. Indeed subgroup analysis by patient characteristic provided results with better heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The results of our review endorse the recommendations of the venous thromboembolism prevention guidelines that high-risk patients should receive multimodal prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolaides-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolaides 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>The studies included in this review were carried out in a wide range of patient groups undergoing orthopedic but also urological, cardiothoracic, general surgery neurosurgery, gynecology procedures and trauma patients. Most of the participants had a high-risk procedure or condition and, therefore, the results of this review are not necessarily applicable to different patient groups, where a much lower risk may reduce the absolute risk reduction with combined modalities.</P>
<P>In an effort to investigate the applicability of combined modalities in orthopedic and non-orthopedic participants, subgroup analysis was performed, confirming the efficacy of adding compression to anticoagulation in orthopedic patients, and the efficacy of adding anticoagulation to compression in non-orthopedic patients, results that indicate a need for further research in particular patient populations. Since studies on combined modalities are mostly performed in patients at a high risk for VTE, the absolute benefit that would be observed is expected to be much lower in moderate-risk patients, calling for cost-effectiveness calculations and studies.</P>
<P>Additionally, it should be noted that the various IPC types may not have the same effectiveness and should not be used interchangeably, for example foot pumps versus calf or calf and thigh leggings, taking into account the results of <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>.</P>
<P>A potential confounding factor in the present review is the concurrent use of elastic stockings, very often used together with IPC.</P>
<P>Also, it should be mentioned that medical (non-surgical) patients were not included in the present review because such studies were not identified by the literature searches.</P>
<P>Reporting of bleeding outcomes (major and minor bleeding) was not uniform across the studies, with some studies reporting on blood loss during the procedures or through the drains or providing rates for postoperative bleeding. Definitions used were also not uniform. This issue deserves further study.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>This review included some 9137 participants who were studied in 22 trials (15 RCTs). This provided a body of evidence to investigate our hypothesis that combined modalities are more effective than their single counterparts. However, risk for performance bias was high in most studies and risk for selection and detection bias was mostly unclear. Nevertheless, the results of the present meta-analysis update are generally consistent with a low amount of heterogeneity in almost all comparisons.</P>
<P>Using GRADE assessment, the quality of evidence for DVT and PE prevention with combined modalities is considered as being moderate. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. Regarding PE for the comparison of combined modalities with IPC alone, the quality of the evidence is downgraded due to very few events with only 4/12 studies contributing to the effect estimate leading to imprecision probably because of a type II error. For the comparison of combined modalities with anticoagulation, the quality of the evidence for PE is downgraded due to detection bias as a sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high or unclear risk of detection bias no longer show a reduction in the incidence of PE. Possible explanations for these two observations regarding PE include the elimination of low quality research leading to more accurate albeit negative results and also reduction of the number of studies and events (i.e. reduced the overall power to detect a difference). Since PE is a form of VTE, like DVT, we think that the second explanation is more rational than the first one. For DVT for both comparisons (combined modalities compared with IPC or anticoagulation) the quality of the evidence is downgraded to moderate due to risk of bias.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for bleeding and major bleeding for the comparison combined modalities versus IPC is moderate. The quality of the evidence was downgraded for indirectness as definitions of bleeding and the reporting of bleeding outcomes was not uniform across studies.<BR/>The quality of the evidence for bleeding and major bleeding for the comparison combined modalities versus pharmacological prophylaxis is very low. The quality of the evidence is downgraded for risk of bias due to blinding, indirectness (because the definition of bleeding and reporting of bleeding outcomes was not uniform across studies) and imprecision (due to the small number of participants and few events).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>The review authors have made an enormous effort to identify potential trials for inclusion in the present review. Publication bias still could have limited the validity of our results.</P>
<P>This review set out to assess RCTs and CCTs. Many of the CCTs are old and the reporting of the study methodology is often poor. In addition, patient care and standard practice has changed considerably since then. When assessing the incidence of DVT and PE in RCTs only the overall direction and size of the effects were not affected. This was likely caused by the fact that many CCTs did not contribute to the analysis due to small number of reported events. However, when sufficient RCTs become available to perform meaningful analyses of the planned subgroups we will consider including RCTs only.</P>
<P>The review assessed symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT and symptomatic PE as outcomes. In future updates, data permitting, we will add proximal DVT and clinically important VTE (proximal DVT and symptomatic PE) as additional important outcomes.</P>
<P>In order to be as inclusive as possible and because not all studies reported on the type of IPC devices used, we included all IPC devices. This resulted in including some devices that may no longer be used in some parts of the world.</P>
<P>We performed no formal assessment of side effects of IPC. However, from the included studies we note these were rarely encountered and recorded by the studies. We will look into this in more detail in future updates.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-31 08:24:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-31 08:24:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Moderate quality evidence suggests that combining IPC with pharmacological prophylaxis, compared with IPC or pharmacological prophylaxis alone, decreases the incidence of DVT when compared to compression, and incidence of PE when compared to anticoagulation. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is no difference between combined and single modalities in the incidence of PE when compared with compression alone and DVT when compared with anticoagulation alone. The quality of evidence for incidence of PE and DVTwas downgraded to moderate due to risk of bias in study methodology and imprecision, highlighting the need for further research. Moderate quality evidence suggests the addition of an pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC, increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed for IPC when added to pharmacological prophylaxis (very low quality evidence), as expected for a physical method of thromboprophylaxis. The quality of evidence for bleeding was downgraded to moderate or very low due to risk of bias in study methodology and indirectness, highlighting the need for further research.The results of the current review agree with current guideline recommendations for hospitalised patients at risk of developing VTE. More studies on the role of combined modalities in VTE prevention are urgently needed, taking also into account the increased bleeding rates after anticoagulation is added to IPC.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:10:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Most patients who received combined modalities in the studies reviewed were at high risk of developing VTE. Although the relative VTE reduction was large in this patient group, the same cannot be extrapolated for patients at moderate risk. Future studies should address this question and also take into account cost-effectiveness issues; looking at benefits in terms of reduced hospital stay, rehabilitation, mortality and long-term complications, for example post-thrombotic syndrome, which add to the burden of disability in the community in the long term. Since the total number of RCTs evaluated in the current review was relatively small, particularly in certain subgroups, future research using RCTs in other patient groups (such as patients with stroke or medical ICU patients) and confirmatory RCTs are warranted. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness for combined modalities has been demonstrated in certain high risk groups by the NICE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). Cost-effectiveness analysis should be performed in order to define the impact of this policy on health economics in both high-risk and moderate-risk patients.</P>
<P>More studies on the role of combined modalities (as opposed to pharmacological prophylaxis alone) in the prevention of pulmonary embolism are urgently needed.</P>
<P>Future research should also aim to use standardised bleeding criteria such as those defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further research should compare the efficacy of improved single modalities, including more effective schedule changes, with their combinations (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kakkos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2008</LINK>). Only one study in the present review used edoxaban, one of the new direct oral anticoagulants (<LINK REF="STD-Sakai-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Sakai 2016</LINK>). Further research on the effect of combined use of recently introduced, improved prophylactic modalities is justified.</P>

<P>The outcomes incidence of bleeding, incidence of major bleeding, and fatal bleeding are important adverse events of pharmacological prophylaxis and have therefore been added to the review.</P>
<P>The outcome fatal PE has been added to the review for completeness.</P>
<P>The method of evaluating study quality has changed since the protocol was published; we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=988902011121051235&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). We have also added 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
<P>Because risk stratification of study participants was not provided nor based on modern or any methodology, all types of participants were included and not only those considered as being at high risk of developing VTE; however many studies included in this review included high risk patients such as those undergoing orthopedic surgery.</P>

These are also the two largest studies in the analysis. When pooled they show a similar direction of effect (increased bleeding for combined modalities) as the overall effect for the seven studies in this comparison indicating that any potential risk of risk of performance or detection bias does not affect the results therefore not downgraded for risk of bias<BR/>Wide confidence interval but upper and lower limits of corresponding risk and 95% confidence interval of effect both show the same message i.e. an increased risk of bleeding for combined modalities therefore not downgraded for imprecision</P>
