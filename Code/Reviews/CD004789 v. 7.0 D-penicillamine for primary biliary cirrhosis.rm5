<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>D-penicillamine did not reduce the risk of mortality of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis but increased the occurrences of adverse events</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon, chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. D-penicillamine, a cupruretic drug, has been tested in randomised clinical trials and is used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. After combining results from seven trials, D-penicillamine did not appear to improve survival of patients. D-penicillamine was associated with a four-time increase of adverse events. There were no significant differences between D-penicillamine and placebo/no intervention with respect to clinical changes, liver histology, and liver biochemistry. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>D-penicillamine is used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis due to its hepatic copper decreasing and immunomodulatory potentials. The results from randomised clinical trials have been inconsistent. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To systematically review the beneficial and harmful effects of D-penicillamine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We identified trials through electronic searches of <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(September 2003), <I>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </I>on<I> The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 3, 2003)<I>, MEDLINE </I>(January 1966 to September 2003)<I>, EMBASE </I>(January 1980 to September 2003)<I>, The Chinese Biomedical CD Database </I>(January 1979 to August 2003)<I>, </I>and<I> LILACS </I>(1982 to 2003); through manual searches of bibliographies; and by contacting authors of the trials and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised clinical trials comparing D-penicillamine with placebo/no intervention or other control intervention irrespective of language, year of publication, and publication status. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data, validated by a third reviewer. The primary outcomes were 1) mortality and 2) a combination of those who died or underwent liver transplantation. We analysed dichotomous outcomes as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by a fixed effect model and a random effects model. We investigated sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analyses and tested the robustness of our findings by sensitivity analyses. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included seven trials randomising 706 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. D-penicillamine compared with placebo/no intervention tended to increase mortality (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.64, fixed; RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.50, random). However, there was substantial heterogeneity. No significant differences were detected regarding the risks of mortality or liver transplantation, pruritus, liver complications, progression of liver histological stage, or the levels of liver biochemical variables (except alanine aminotransferase). D-penicillamine versus placebo/no intervention significantly increased the risk of adverse events (RR 3.11, 95% CI 2.33 to 4.16, fixed; RR 4.18, 95% CI 1.38 to 12.69, random).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>D-penicillamine did not appear to reduce the risk of mortality, but significantly increased the occurrences of adverse events in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. We do not support the use of D-penicillamine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. <BR/>
</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:01:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic progressive liver disease of unknown etiology. Ninety per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are females, and the majority are diagnosed after the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-James-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1981</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is classically defined on the basis of the triad: antimitochondrial antibodies, found in over 95 per cent patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fregeau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fregeau 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacerda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacerda 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Invernizzi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Invernizzi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turchany-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turchany 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattalia-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattalia 1998</LINK>); abnormal liver function tests that are typically cholestatic (raised activity of alkaline phosphatases are the most frequently seen abnormality); and characteristic liver histological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheuer-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheuer 1967</LINK>) without extrahepatic biliary obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1996</LINK>). Patients may either be diagnosed during a symptomatic phase (with common symptoms as pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, liver enlargement, signs of portal hypertension, sicca complex, and scleroderma-like lesions) when survival is decreased or during an asymptomatic phase when the prognosis is relatively favourable (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balasubramaniam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasubramaniam 1990</LINK>). However, 40 to 100 per cent of the asymptomatic patients will subsequently develop symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nyberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metcalf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalf 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prince-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the etiology remains unknown, primary biliary cirrhosis is in many respects analogous to the graft-versus-host syndrome in which the immune system is sensitised to foreign proteins. Most primary biliary cirrhosis patients have increased expression of class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) histocompatibility on bile duct cells (<LINK REF="REF-Ballardini-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballardini 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Oord-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Oord 1986</LINK>). The bile duct epithelium in these patients is infiltrated with cytotoxic T-cells (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 1986</LINK>). Lacrimal and pancreatic glands, for example, with a high concentration of HLA class II antigens on their epithelium, may be involved in the disease process (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are administered many drugs. Ursodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid, is the most extensively used drug (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). However, a meta-analysis and a systematic Cochrane review were unable to demonstrate any significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on mortality or liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2002</LINK>). Over the years, a number of other drugs have been evaluated for primary biliary cirrhosis. Attempts to treat primary biliary cirrhosis using immune-modulating and other agents such as azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heathcote 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1985</LINK>), prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1992</LINK>), chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1986</LINK>), cyclosporine (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 1990</LINK>), colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vuoristo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vuoristo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1996</LINK>), or methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1995</LINK>) have resulted in clinical effects that have not led to widespread acceptance of these drugs in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>D-penicillamine is a cupruretic drug known for its efficacy in treating Wilson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sternlieb-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sternlieb 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deiss-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deiss 1971</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is also associated with increased hepatic levels of copper. Therefore, the major rationale for evaluating D-penicillamine in primary biliary cirrhosis was its ability to induce cupruresis. In addition, D-penicillamine has other pharmacologic actions of potential benefit, including antifibrogenic effect, ability to decrease circulating immune complexes, and inhibitory effect on lymphocyte function (<LINK REF="REF-Nimni-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nimni 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipsky-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsky 1980</LINK>). There are about 2,500,000 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in the world (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>). At least 2.8 per cent of these patients are probably being treated with D-penicillamine according to UK experience (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). This means that about 70,000 primary biliary cirrhosis patients around the world may receive D-penicillamine as treatment. This figure may even be larger as we think that physicians in UK are conservative - at least when compared to other European physicians regarding interventions for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conflicting reports concerning the effects of D-penicillamine in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis have been published. Earlier reports showed that D-penicillamine was a promising drug, improving survival in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and having relatively few side-effects (<LINK REF="STD-Triger-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Triger 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK>). Several later studies showed that D-penicillamine did decrease hepatic levels of copper, but it did not have a beneficial effect on symptoms related to primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatic biochemistries, histologic progression, or survival. In addition, D-penicillamine was associated with up to a 46 per cent incidence of major toxicity, most commonly proteinuria, allergic drug reaction, and rarely bone marrow depression (<LINK REF="STD-Matloff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neuberger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dickson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bodenheimer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bodenheimer 1985</LINK>). We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the beneficial and harmful effects of D-penicillamine in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>

<BR/>All outcomes were extracted from each included trial.</P>
<P>We analysed mortality and/or liver transplantation at maximum follow-up. We analysed other outcomes, which were repeatedly observed on patients (like liver biochemistry, clinical symptoms, etc.) at maximum follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>We intended to include parallel group and cross-over trials. For cross-over trials, we only intended to include data from the first period. We used the statistical package (RevMan Analyses 1.0.2) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. We presented dichotomous data as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous outcome measures by weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. All analyses for primary outcomes were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, which means that participants in the trials should have been analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received or adhered to the allocated intervention.</P>
<P>We examined intervention effects by using both a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) with the significant level set at P-value &#8804; 0.05. If the results of the two analyses led to the same conclusion, we presented only the results of the fixed effect analysis. In case of discrepancies of the two models, we reported the results of both models. We explored the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi-squared test with significance set at P-value &#8804; 0.10 and measured the quantities of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2</SUP>. However, due to possible few anticipated trials and the relative large number of outcomes going to be assessed, we interpreted significant results with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis<BR/>
</B>We performed subgroup analyses, in which trials were grouped according to the methodological quality of the included trials, dosage of D-penicillamine, and duration of treatment and follow-up. The high methodological quality was confined to adequate generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. The difference between the estimates of two subgroups was estimated according to <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Regarding the primary outcome measure, ie, mortality, we included patients with incomplete or missing data in the sensitivity analyses by imputing them (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Available case analysis: data on only those whose results are known, using as denominator the total number of patients who completed the trial;</LI>
<LI>Assuming poor outcome: dropouts from both the D-penicillamine and control groups had the primary outcomes;</LI>
<LI>Assuming good outcome: none of the dropouts from the D-penicillamine and control groups had the primary outcomes;</LI>
<LI>Extreme case favouring D-penicillamine: none of the dropouts from the D-penicillamine-group but the dropouts from the control group had the primary outcomes;</LI>
<LI>Extreme case favouring control: all dropouts from the D-penicillamine-group but none from the control group had the primary outcomes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For secondary outcomes, we adopted 'available case analysis'. Therefore, in the review, the number of patients in the denominator changed according to the secondary outcomes investigated.</P>
<P>
<B>Bias exploration</B>
<BR/>Funnel plot was used to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates are associated with study size. The performance of the available methods of detecting publication bias and other biases (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) vary with the magnitude of the treatment effect, the distribution of study size, and whether a one- or two-tailed test is used (<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>). Therefore, we used the most appropriate method, which has a good trade-off in the sensitivity and specificity, based on characteristics of the trials included in this review.</P>

<P>We identified a total of 178 references through electronic searches of <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (n = 26), <I>The Cochrane Central Register</I> <I>of Controlled Trials </I>on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (n = 28), <I>MEDLINE</I> (n = 29), <I>EMBASE</I> (n = 51), <I>The Chinese Biomedical CD Database</I> (n = 43), and <I>LILACS</I> (n = 1). We excluded 143 duplicates and clearly irrelevant references by reading abstracts. Accordingly, 35 references were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, we excluded three because they were non-randomised clinical studies or observational studies. The remaining 32 references referred to seven randomised clinical trials involving 706 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria ('Characteristics of included studies' table). The year of publication of these trials ranged from year 1981 to 1985. The <LINK REF="STD-Bassendine-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bassendine 1982</LINK> trial was published as an abstract only, while the other six trials were published as full papers.</P>
<P>The mean age of the patients was about 51 years. The majority of the patients were females (female/male: 495/53) in the trials reporting gender distribution. The <LINK REF="STD-Bassendine-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bassendine 1982</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK> trial did not report the baseline histological status of primary biliary cirrhosis. Data from the other five trials showed that more patients had stage III or IV than stage I or II (stage III or IV /stage I or II: 443/168).</P>
<P>Of the seven trials, six trials compared D-penicillamine with placebo/no intervention. One trial compared 750 mg/day D-penicillamine with 250 mg/day D-penicillamine (<LINK REF="STD-Bodenheimer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bodenheimer 1985</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Bassendine-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bassendine 1982</LINK> trial had three groups of comparisons: D-penicillamine 1g/day, 250 mg/day, and no intervention group. We extracted data from the group of 1g/day versus no intervention, which was the most commonly used dosage. All of the remaining five trials employed placebo as control intervention. The D-penicillamine dosage of 1g/day was applied in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bassendine-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bassendine 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dickson 1985</LINK>), 1.2 g/day in the <LINK REF="STD-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neuberger 1985</LINK> trial, and 0.6 g/day in the <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1981</LINK> trial.

It should be noted that the description of the control in the trials reporting double blinding was not sufficient since all the trials claiming to be double blind only stated the use of identical in appearance placebo tablets, but did not address smell and taste. Follow-up was adequate in five trials, but considered inadequate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bodenheimer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bodenheimer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1981</LINK>).

<I>Mortality<BR/>
</I>
</B>Six trials (628 patients) provided data to estimate the risk of mortality of D-penicillamine versus placebo/no intervention (Comparison 01-01; Comparison 01-02). The mortality risk was 1.46 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.50) by the random effects model and 1.34 (95% 1.09 to 1.64) by the fixed effect model. The trials had significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77.5%).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data. The 'assuming poor outcome' showed a significant harmful effect of D-penicillamine on mortality. However, the 'assuming good outcome' analyses did not detect a significant difference of mortality between D-penicillamine and placebo/no intervention (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26). The 'extreme case favouring control' showed a significant harmful effect of D-penicillamine on mortality (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.43, fixed, RR 2.13, 95%CI 1.16 to 3.90, random). The 'extreme case favouring D-penicillamine' showed a significant beneficial effect of D-penicillamine (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86). We also performed 'available case analysis', in which we did not find a significant difference between D-penicillamine and placebo (RR 1.08, 95% 0.82 to 1.43).</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analyses according to different methodological quality, dosages of D-penicillamine, duration of treatment and follow-up, and histological stages (Comparison 01-05 to 11). The estimate of intervention effect were significantly different in the subgroup analyses of generation of allocation sequence (P = 0.03), allocation concealment (P = 0.04), blinding (P = 0.007), and follow-up (P = 0.008). The subgroup analyses stratifying the trials into three dosages of D-penicillamine (1.2 g/day, 1 g/day, or 0.6 g/day) did not show a clear increasing trend towards harmful effects of D-penicillamine along with increased dosage (Comparison 01-09), although the lowest dose had the lowest harm profile. The trial using dosage of 0.6 g/day showed a significant difference from the trials with 1 g/day (P = 0.04) and with 1.2 g/day (P = 0.005), while the comparison between 1 g/day and 1.2 g/day did not achieve significance. The risks of mortality in the trials with short-term treatment and follow-up (shorter than three years) had a significant difference with the trials with long-term treatment and follow-up (longer than three years) (P = 0.003).</P>

Accordingly, the relative risk of mortality or liver transplantation was 1.33 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.63) in the fixed effect model and 1.45 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.48) in the random effects model (Comparison 01-13,01-14).</P>

D-penicillamine did not retard the progression of liver histological stage (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.58) but D-penicillamine had a significant beneficial effect on inflammatory activity in the <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1981</LINK> trial (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.94, one trial).</P>

</B>All the seven trials reported adverse events in both groups. In the D-penicillamine group, 139 (43%) patients had adverse events (types of adverse events in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) versus 44 (15%) patients treated with placebo/no intervention (RR 4.18, 95% CI 1.38 to 12.69, random; RR 3.11, 95% CI 2.33 to 4.16, fixed, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93.2%) (Comparison 01-23, 24). In the sensitivity analysis after excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK> trial, which had the smallest sample size (24 patients)and the highest placebo response rate (85 per cent), the RR changed to 3.69 (95% CI 2.62 to 5.19) and I<SUP>2 </SUP>went down to 49.7%.

More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group tended to develop adverse events (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.89). The <LINK REF="STD-Bodenheimer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bodenheimer 1985</LINK> trial only reported the total number of deaths in the two groups, and more patients in the high-dose group had improvement of histological progression than in the low-dose group.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:02:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We found that D-penicillamine tended to have a detrimental effect on mortality of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The meta-analysis also showed that the use of D-penicillamine significantly increased the occurrences of adverse events.</P>
<P>Our systematic review on D-penicillamine versus placebo/no intervention analysed only six trials involving 628 patients. This is a low number of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>). None of the trials reported a sample size estimate. The loss during follow-up was relatively high in the D-penicillamine group. The methodological trial quality was generally low, which makes it hard to interpret this sample of trials. Generally, low methodological quality trials overestimate significantly intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). If the same overestimation is valid for the present sample of trials, the prospects for D-penicillamine for primary biliary cirrhosis look even worse, ie, the harmful effects could be even larger. On the other hand, we cannot preclude that such low-doses D-penicillamine may have beneficial effects because only a few trials have been performed with low-doses. In addition, most of the trials have shorter follow-up than the estimated median survival of 10 to 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is difficult to detect a significant difference on mortality.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity is an important aspect of a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity can occur because of an artefact of the summary measures used and of trial design features such as duration of follow-up, reliability of outcome measures, or methodological quality of the trial. It may also be due to real variations in the treatment effect, such as the underlying risk of the patients in the different trials, intervention timing or intensity, co-intervention, or the outcome measurement and timing. Although the ideal way to study causes of true variations is within trials rather than between, in most situations we had to do with a trial level investigation in the present meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding mortality, we found 'severe' heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>) across the trials and also discrepancy between the fixed effect analysis and the random effects analysis. In the fixed effect analysis, we detected a significant harmful effect of D-penicillamine, while in the random effects analysis, no significant difference was found. Due to the low number of trials, which did not allow us to perform a meaningful meta-regression, we performed subgroup analyses according to the methodological quality, dosage of D-penicillamine, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Bearing in mind the observational nature of the subgroup analyses, we found that only the unclear/inadequate follow-up tended to underestimate the beneficial effects of D-penicillamine. This finding is in contrast to previous studies (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>), probably because too low number of trials were included to perform any meaningful subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>We found that D-penicillamine had no significant effect on reducing the risk of mortality compared to placebo/no intervention. The pooled estimate from high quality trials also support this finding. The analyses of the four scenarios, which took the impact of missing data into consideration, showed that patients taking D-penicillamine were more likely to have higher risk of mortality compared to patients taking placebo or getting no intervention. The 'assuming poor outcome' showed the significantly harmful effect of D-penicillamine, while the 'assuming good outcome' did not catch any significant difference between D-penicillamine and placebo/no intervention.</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis showed that the risk of mortality seemed to increase by dosage. This observation, however, was not supported by the <LINK REF="STD-Bassendine-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bassendine 1982</LINK> trial, where the patients taking high dose of D-penicillamine had lower risk of mortality than patients on low dose. Since the ideal way to study causes of true variation is within trials rather than between, and the purpose and nature of this meta-analysis was not to study the dose-response, the relationship between the effect of D-penicillamine and dosage is not clear.</P>
<P>It is presumed that high-risk groups will have more to gain from an intervention and may therefore experience sufficient benefit to outweigh the harms. Whether the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis was related to the treatment effect of D-penicillamine is not confirmed in this review. There was lack of trials to be included and also the possible relationship was not indicated in many of the trials.</P>
<P>Only Neuberger et al reported the number of patients having clinical changes (<LINK REF="STD-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neuberger 1985</LINK>), which revealed that there were no significant differences on the state of pruritus, gastrointestinal bleeding, or ascites between D-penicillamine and placebo. Although the remaining trials did not report the exact data, they all claimed that no consistent clinical improvement in either the D-penicillamine or placebo group had been found (<LINK REF="STD-Dickson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dickson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from three trials enabled us to meta-analyse the effects of D-penicillamine on liver histology and we found that the rate of liver histological progression neither favoured D-penicillamine nor favoured placebo/no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK>). There is a significant beneficial effect of D-penicillamine regarding histological inflammatory activity (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1981</LINK>). However, the effect is only marginally significant and based on only one trial with a small sample size of patients.</P>
<P>The report by Matloff et al allowed us to extract data on liver biochemical variables, which resulted in no significant differences except for alanine aminotransferase (<LINK REF="STD-Matloff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 1982</LINK>). This finding was replicated in the <LINK REF="STD-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neuberger 1985</LINK> trial in which alanine aminotransferase was the only significant difference among the various liver biochemical variables. Epstein 1981and <LINK REF="STD-Bassendine-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bassendine 1982</LINK> found a beneficial effect of D-penicillamine in reducing the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and immunoglobulin. <LINK REF="STD-Dickson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dickson 1985</LINK> did not detect any significant effect, and <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK> found that D-penicillamine significantly decreased immunoglobulin M and G levels. Thus, the inconsistent findings across the trials weakened the conclusion of beneficial effect of D-penicillamine on liver biochemical variables at large.</P>
<P>Six out of seven trials reported on adverse events and showed that the risk of adverse events in the D-penicillamine group was, on average, four times higher than the placebo/no intervention group both in random effects and fixed effect models. Most of the adverse events were proteinuria, gastrointestinal upset, rash, cytopenia, etc.</P>
<P>In the meta-analyses of adverse events, we also found severe heterogeneity across the trials. Although the results from the fixed effect and random effects models indicated that the use of D-penicillamine highly increased the occurrences of adverse events, investigation for sources of heterogeneity was necessary. We found that I<SUP>2 </SUP>decreased to zero (no statistical heterogeneity) when changing the RR to the odds ratio (OR). However, the selection of a summary measure on the basis of minimising heterogeneity is a somewhat data derived approach since it generates spurious, over-optimistic findings. It is theoretically possible that important sources of heterogeneity could be missed if the strategy of using the summary with the smallest heterogeneity statistic is universally applied (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>). Considering that the selection of a summary measure being argued on the grounds of consistency of effect, ease of interpretation, and mathematical properties, we left RR as the summary measure in the analysis of adverse events.</P>
<P>For meta-analyses of RR, the proportional weights, given to trials estimating the same effect with the same sample size, increase with increasing event rates. The relationship becomes particularly strong when the event rates are above 50 per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001b</LINK>). In this respect, we scrutinized the event rates in the included trials and we noticed that the <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK> trial had the smallest sample size (24 patients), but surprisingly the highest placebo response rate, 85 per cent. It was offered the second most weight, 23 per cent in the analysis of RR, whereas the weight of 2 per cent was used in the analysis of OR. Hence, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Taal-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1983</LINK> trial, and it resulted in the RR of 3.69 (95% CI 2.62 to 5.19) with the acceptable moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 49.7%). Therefore, our conclusion, that the use of D-penicillamine was associated with the increase of adverse events, was consolidated.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>D-penicillamine did not significantly reduce the risk of mortality of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Furthermore, we found a significant increase of adverse events when comparing patients taking D-penicillamine with those on placebo/no intervention. Hence, we are against using D-penicillamine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We do not recommend further randomised clinical trials aiming at establishing the value of D-penicillamine in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, at least not with the dosages employed in previous trials. The possibility that low doses may offer beneficial effects cannot be excluded. Investigators ought to report their trials according to the CONSORT Statement (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
