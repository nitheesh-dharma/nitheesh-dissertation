<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-06 11:40:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After a woman gives birth, womb muscles contract, clamping down on the blood vessels and helping to limit bleeding when the placenta has detached. If the muscles do not contract strongly enough, very heavy bleeding (postpartum haemorrhage) can occur, which can be life threatening. These situations are common in resource-poor countries, and maternal mortality is about 100 times higher than in resource-rich countries. It is a very serious problem that requires effective treatments that might avoid the use of surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy). This is often the last treatment option and leaves the woman unable to have more children. In most settings, women are given a drug at the time of birth (before excessive bleeding occurs) to reduce the likelihood of excessive blood loss. However, despite this intervention, some women bleed excessively, and this review looked to see what interventions might be used to reduce the amount of blood lost by these women. Treatment options include drugs to increase muscles contractions (such as oxytocin, ergometrine and prostaglandins like misoprostol), drugs to help with blood clotting (haemostatic drugs such as tranexamic acid and recombinant activated factor VII), surgical techniques (such as tying off or blocking of the uterine artery) and radiological interventions (to assist in blocking the main artery to the womb by using gel foams).</P>
<P>The review identified 10 randomised controlled trials involving 4052 women. Seven of these trials looked at a drug called misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin and so works by increasing muscle contractions. Overall, the trials suggest that misoprostol does not work as well as oxytocin infusion, and it has more side effects. However, oxytocin needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and so in settings where refrigeration and infusions are not readily available, misoprostol can be used.</P>
<P>Other clinical trials looked into using other types of drugs or squeezing the main artery that supplies blood to the woman. The number of women included in these studies was too small for any useful conclusions regarding their effectiveness and safety.</P>

<P>Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review.</P>
<P>Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics. Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.41).  </P>
<P>Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics, and the other did not. Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75). Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting and shivering.</P>
<P>Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid, respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes.</P>
<P>One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes.</P>
<P>We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-06 11:24:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical trials included in the current review were not adequately powered to assess impact on the primary outcome measures. Compared with misoprostol, oxytocin infusion is more effective and causes fewer side effects when used as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary PPH. When used after prophylactic uterotonics, misoprostol and oxytocin infusion worked similarly. The review suggests that among women who received oxytocin for the treatment of primary PPH, adjunctive use of misoprostol confers no added benefit.</P>
<P>The role of tranexamic acid and compression methods requires further evaluation. Furthermore, future studies should focus on the best way to treat women who fail to respond to uterotonic therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-27 09:51:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nearly half a million women die annually across the world from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Approximately one-quarter of these deaths are caused by complications of the third stage of labour, that is, excessive bleeding within the first 24 hours after delivery, also known as primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (<LINK REF="REF-Abou-Zahr-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou Zahr 1991</LINK>). In the developing world, PPH remains the leading cause of maternal death, accounting for one-third of maternal deaths in Asia and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). In the United Kingdom (UK), the risk of death from obstetrical haemorrhage is about one in 100,000 deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Cantwell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantwell 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Physiology</HEADING>
<P>The uterus is composed of a unique interlacing network of muscle fibres known as 'myometrium'. The blood vessels that supply the placental bed pass through this latticework of uterine muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Baskett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 2000</LINK>). Myometrial contraction is the main driving force for both placental separation and haemostasis through constriction of these blood vessels. This blood-saving mechanism is known as the 'physiological sutures' or 'living ligatures' (<LINK REF="REF-Baskett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 2000</LINK>). The physiological increase in clotting factors during labour helps to control blood loss after separation of the placenta.</P>
<P>Active management of the third stage of labour has been standard practice in many parts of the world for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1989</LINK>). It is suggested that prophylactic administration of a uterotonic will help to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion after delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>). The role of early cord clamping and controlled cord traction in the reduction of bleeding is less clear; although it was once thought important to deliver the placenta quickly after uterotonic drug administration, to prevent it from being retained (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2013</LINK>), delayed cord clamping is now favoured.</P>
<P>Blood loss up to 500 mL at delivery is regarded as 'physiological&#8217;. It is part of the normal mechanism that brings the mother's blood parameters to their normal non-pregnant levels, and a healthy pregnant woman can cope with it with no difficulty (<LINK REF="REF-Gyte-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripley 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Traditionally, primary PPH is defined as bleeding from the genital tract of 500 mL or more in the first 24 hours following delivery of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Abou-Zahr-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou Zahr 1991</LINK>). Alternative cutoff levels of 600 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Beischer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beischer 1986</LINK>), 1000 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Burchell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burchell 1980</LINK>), 1500 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2002</LINK>), with a substantial fall in haematocrit or the need for blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991</LINK>), have also been used. Unfortunately, underestimation of blood loss following delivery is a common problem, as visually (clinically) assessed bleeding underestimates measured blood loss by an average of 100 to 150 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Pritchard-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritchard 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stafford-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stafford 2008</LINK>). Several methods have been proposed for measuring blood loss objectively, but they are used mainly for research purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2010</LINK>). In addition, women delivering by caesarean section lose more blood on average than women who have vaginal birth; therefore, 1000 mL is commonly used as a cutoff for significant blood loss after caesarean section. Overall, a trend towards increasing the rate of primary PPH has been seen in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Causes and risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Several factors influence PPH rates, including whether blood loss is measured, how the third stage of labour is managed (e.g. the provision of uterotonic, uterine massage, controlled cord traction), obstetrical interventions carried out at the time of delivery (e.g. episiotomy, mode of delivery) and characteristics of the study population (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 2008</LINK>). Lack of efficient uterine contraction (uterine atony) is the most common cause of primary PPH. Other aetiological factors include retained parts of the placenta and vaginal or cervical tears. Uterine rupture, clotting disorders and uterine inversion are extremely rare but often very dramatic causes of heavy bleeding. Several investigators have attempted to identify factors that may pre-dispose women to excessive blood loss after delivery. Examples of risk factors include first pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1985</LINK>), maternal obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Aisaka-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aisaka 1988</LINK>), a large baby (<LINK REF="REF-Stones-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stones 1993</LINK>), twin pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2012</LINK>), prolonged or augmented labour (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1987</LINK>), chorioamnionitis, pre-eclampsia, maternal anaemia and antepartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Wetta-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetta 2013</LINK>). High multiparity does not appear to be a risk factor in high- or low-income countries, even after control for maternal age (<LINK REF="REF-Drife-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drife 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stones-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stones 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsu 1993</LINK>). Despite the identification of potential risk factors, primary PPH often occurs unpredictably in low-risk women (<LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications</HEADING>
<P>The most important consequences of severe PPH include death, hypovolaemic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, renal failure, hepatic failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnar 2000</LINK>). In low-income countries, poor nutritional status, lack of easy access to treatment and inadequate intensive care and blood bank facilities are additional contributing factors that lead to high morbidity and mortality rates in these countries (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). As no definition of PPH has been universally accepted, the exact incidence of serious complications is difficult to ascertain (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management of primary PPH</HEADING>
<P>Treatment for primary PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach. After exclusion of lower genital tract tears, in most cases, bleeding is due to uterine atony. Uterotonics that increase the efficiency of uterine contraction, including ergometrine and oxytocin, were introduced as first-line therapy for atonic PPH in the 19th century. Women who continue to bleed require further assessment and interventions to control bleeding. These interventions may include additional uterotonics, haemostatic drugs, surgical interventions, radiological embolisation and/or compression devices (<LINK REF="REF-Abou-El-Senoun-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou El Senoun 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ergometrine</HEADING>
<P>John Stearns (<LINK REF="REF-Stearns-1822" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stearns 1822</LINK>) was the first to emphasise the use of ergots for PPH. Earlier, he wrote describing ergot's action: "It expedites lingering parturition ... The pains induced by it are peculiarly forcing ... In most cases you will be surprised with the suddenness of its operation" (<LINK REF="REF-Stearns-1808" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stearns 1808</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Moir-1932" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moir 1932</LINK> noticed that administration of aqueous ergot extract by mouth is associated with dramatic and vigorous uterine contractions, which were described as the 'John Stearns effect'. In 1935, Dudley and Moir were able to isolate the pure crystallised substance from the water-soluble extract of ergot that was responsible for the 'John Stearns effect', and they called it 'ergometrine' (<LINK REF="REF-Dudley-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudley 1935</LINK>). The isolation of a new water-soluble extract of ergot was announced almost simultaneously from three other centres: in America (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1935</LINK>), the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1935</LINK>) and Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1935</LINK>). It turned out to be the same substance. The Americans called their preparation ergonovine, and the Swiss used the name ergobasine. Although the use of oxytocin is usually free of adverse effects, the use of ergometrine may be associated with nausea, vomiting and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Oxytocin</HEADING>
<P>In 1953, Vincent Du Vigneaud (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Vigneaud-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Vigneaud 1953</LINK>) identified the structure of oxytocin and was able to synthesise the hormone. By the 1980s, several randomised controlled trials and their meta-analyses confirmed the effectiveness of active management of the third stage in reducing PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>). Oxytocin and ergometrine have traditionally formed essential components of first-line therapy in the management of primary PPH. Ergometrine (and the mixed drug combination of oxytocin and ergometrine) is contraindicated in women with a history of hypertension, heart disease, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia.</P>
<P>Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic oxytocin analogue that can be administered as a single dose either intravenously or intramuscularly; it produces a similar uterotonic effect as oxytocin. Intravenously administered carbetocin has a half-life of 40 minutes (four to 10 times longer than oxytocin). Uterine activity persists for 120 minutes and 60 minutes following intramuscular and intravenous injection, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1992</LINK>). In Europe, this drug is licenced only for prevention of uterine atony after caesarean section. Carbetocin is as effective, but more expensive, than oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2007</LINK>). It may have unpleasant side effects, including headaches, tremor, hypotension, flushing, nausea, abdominal pain, pruritus and a feeling of warmth (<LINK REF="REF-Rath-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rath 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>By the 1970s, the prostaglandin F2 alpha series was discovered by Sune Bergstrom, among others (<LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 1962</LINK>). The 15-methyl analogue of prostaglandin F2 alpha has been reported to have a high success rate if used alone (88%) or in combination with other uterotonic agents (95%) (<LINK REF="REF-Oleen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oleen 1990</LINK>). Prostaglandin administration could be associated with unpleasant side effects, including vomiting, diarrhoea, hypertension and fever (<LINK REF="REF-Oleen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oleen 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Misoprostol, a methyl ester synthetic analogue of natural prostaglandin E1, is a thermo-stable, inexpensive drug that can be used for prevention and treatment of PPH. It can be administered orally, sublingually, buccally, vaginally or rectally. A Cochrane systematic review of randomised trials of misoprostol versus injectable uterotonics in management of the third stage of labour suggests that the drug is less effective than injectable uterotonics in the prevention of severe PPH (blood loss &#8805; 1000 mL) and has more adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunçalp 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most cases, uterotonic drugs will control postpartum bleeding, but if they do not, surgical intervention must be considered.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">B. Haemostatic drugs</HEADING>
<P>Haemostatic drugs, including tranexamic acid (<LINK REF="REF-As-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">As 1996</LINK>) and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (<LINK REF="REF-Moscardo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscardo 2001</LINK>), have been used for the treatment of intractable haemorrhage unresponsive to first- and second-line therapies. Tranexamic acid is a systemic antifibrinolytic agent that is widely used in surgery to prevent clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) and therefore to reduce blood loss. It is a simple, inexpensive drug that requires no training for administration and can be used for prevention and treatment of primary PPH (<LINK REF="REF-As-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">As 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novikova-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novikova 2010</LINK>). It has a short half-life of two hours.The use of tranexamic acid may be associated with side effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Other rare complications include hypotension, thrombosis, blurred vision, renal cortical necrosis and retinal artery obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Novikova-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novikova 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peitsidis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peitsidis 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) has also been successfully used for controlling life-threatening PPH. It reduces blood loss through enhancement of tissue factor&#8211;dependent coagulation. It is effective in up to 80% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2007</LINK>) but is quite expensive. Adverse events were observed in 2.5% of treated cases (<LINK REF="REF-Franchini-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franchini 2010</LINK>). Of note, all adverse events were thrombotic, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis and myocardial infarction.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">C. Surgical interventions</HEADING>
<P>Porro (<LINK REF="REF-Porro-1876" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porro 1876</LINK>) was the first to describe caesarean hysterectomy to prevent death from uterine haemorrhage. However, the technique is associated with major complications and sterility. Active attempts have been made to introduce other conservative measures to avoid hysterectomy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Uterine tamponade</HEADING>
<P>Uterine packing, using several yards of wide gauze placed inside the uterine cavity, was one of the earliest methods introduced to achieve a tamponade effect to control primary PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Eastman-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eastman 1950</LINK>). It fell out of favour in the 1950s, as it was thought to conceal haemorrhage and cause infection (<LINK REF="REF-Eastman-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eastman 1950</LINK>). However, this technique re-emerged in the 1980s and 1990s after these concerns were not confirmed (<LINK REF="REF-Maier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maier 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over the past decade, active attempts have been made to introduce better alternatives for uterine packing through the use of balloon tamponade, including Foley&#8217;s catheter (<LINK REF="REF-De-Loor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Loor 1996</LINK>
<I>)</I>, the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1997</LINK>),  the Rusch catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 2001</LINK>), the Bakri balloon (<LINK REF="REF-Bakri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakri 1999</LINK>) and the condom catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Akhter--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akhter 2005</LINK>). After exclusion of a genital tract laceration, these procedures can be considered for control of obstetrical haemorrhage secondary to uterine atony, placenta accreta and placenta praevia. Overall, the difference between them is related mainly to balloon volume and the presence or absence of a cavity for draining blood. The overall success rate is around 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Doumouchtsis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumouchtsis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Georgiou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgiou 2009</LINK>). Close observation of uterine size and the general condition of the woman is mandatory, as significant bleeding may occur distal to the bulb (<LINK REF="REF-Alamia-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alamia 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Artery ligation and uterine compression sutures</HEADING>
<P>Ligation of the uterine artery or its main supply (internal iliac artery) may be considered in selected cases (<LINK REF="REF-AbdRabbo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AbdRabbo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jouppila-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jouppila 1995</LINK>). However, the latter may be technically difficult and is successful in less than 50% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Clark--1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uterine compression sutures have recently been described (<LINK REF="REF-B_x002d_Lynch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">B-Lynch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cho-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cho 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marasinghe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marasinghe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouahba-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouahba 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2011</LINK>). B-Lynch was the first to describe a suture that runs through the full thickness of both uterine walls (anterior and posterior) (<LINK REF="REF-B_x002d_Lynch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">B-Lynch 1997</LINK>). When tied, the suture allows tight compression of the uterine walls and stops the bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2001</LINK>). Single or multiple stitches may be inserted at the same time and, according to the shape, they may be called brace suture (<LINK REF="REF-B_x002d_Lynch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">B-Lynch 1997</LINK>), simple brace (<LINK REF="REF-Hayman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayman 2002</LINK>) or square sutures (<LINK REF="REF-Cho-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cho 2000</LINK>). Although they are thought to be effective in selected cases, unexpected occlusion of the uterine cavity with subsequent development of intrauterine synechiae (<LINK REF="REF-Poujade-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poujade 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rathat-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathat 2011</LINK>) or infection (pyometra) has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ochoa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochoa 2002</LINK>). The choice of the type of surgical intervention depends on several factors, paramount of which is the experience of the surgeon. Other factors include parity and desire for future children, the extent of the haemorrhage and the general condition of the woman (<LINK REF="REF-Cantwell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantwell 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D. Radiological embolisation</HEADING>
<P>Selective radiological embolisation of the bleeding vessel may be a therapeutic option in centres where interventional radiologists are available and the bleeding is not life threatening (<LINK REF="REF-Arulkumaran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arulkumaran 2007</LINK>). In a systematic review, Doumouchtsis and colleagues evaluated the success rate of emergency embolisation for the control of major PPH. They reported a success rate of 91% (<LINK REF="REF-Doumouchtsis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumouchtsis 2007</LINK>). The procedure has many advantages including minimal morbidity and complication rates, shorter hospital stay and preservation of fertility; it can be carried out under local anaesthesia, and success can be verified. The procedure is not free of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Doumouchtsis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumouchtsis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penninx-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penninx 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tseng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tseng 2011</LINK>). Postprocedure fever is the most common complication and typically resolves within two to three days. Other complications include feet ischaemia, bladder and rectal wall necrosis and sciatic nerve injury (<LINK REF="REF-Doumouchtsis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumouchtsis 2007</LINK>). Late re-bleeding is a rare but serious problem, and repeated embolisation or hysterectomy may be required. The use of interventional radiological techniques is limited by availability, and few centres have a 24-hour trained, skilled team. Unlike with other procedures, an unstable patient has to be moved to the angiography suite (<LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">E. Non-pneumatic antishock garment (NASG) and aortic compression device</HEADING>
<P>In the 1900s, an inflatable pressure suit was developed by George Crile (<LINK REF="REF-Vahedi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vahedi 1995</LINK>). After several modifications, it was used in the Vietnam War for resuscitation of soldiers with traumatic injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Cutler-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 1971</LINK>). In the 1970s, the G-suit was modified into a half-suit, which became known as MAST (military antishock trousers) or PASG (pneumatic antishock garment). From the 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contributed to the development of a &#8220;non-pneumatic version&#8221; of the antishock garment. This was originally used for children with haemophilia but has since been developed into the garment known as the non-pneumatic antishock garment (NASG) (<LINK REF="REF-Haggerty-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggerty 1996</LINK>). The NASG is a low-technology pressure device that decreases blood loss, restores vital signs and has the potential to reduce adverse outcomes by helping women survive delays in receiving adequate emergency obstetrical care. Use of this garment as a temporising measure to stabilise women awaiting transfer to higher levels of care began in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Hensleigh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensleigh 2002</LINK>). Use of NASG among women with primary PPH in low-income countries was associated with significant reduction of measured blood loss, severe maternal morbidities and mortality and emergency hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ojengbede-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojengbede 2011</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>External aortic compression is an emergency manoeuvre proposed to reduce PPH and permit time for resuscitation and control of bleeding. This technique involves compression of the abdominal aorta using a strong metal spring that is cylindrical in shape and is fixed in place by a leather belt wrapped around the waist (<LINK REF="STD-Soltan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Soltan 2009</LINK>). It is a cost-effective and easily applied manoeuvre that allows satisfactory management of PPH (<LINK REF="STD-Soltan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Soltan 2009</LINK>). </P>

<P>Assessment of blood loss could vary between trials. It is expected that measurement of blood and blood clots in jars and weighing of linen are likely to be more precise than clinical judgement. The latter is known to underestimate blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Pritchard-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritchard 1962</LINK>). The way of reporting the amount of loss as 'greater than' or 'greater than or equal to' a certain cutoff level (e.g. greater than 500 mL or greater than or equal to 500 mL) may affect the total reported amount of blood loss, especially when this amount is estimated. It is expected that trials evaluating uterotonic or haemostatic drugs may use other uterotonics to maintain contractions of the uterus after randomisation. Also, it should be taken into consideration that hysterectomy could be a method of intervention or co-intervention, as well as an outcome measure.</P>

<P>Eight uterotonic studies were identified and considered for inclusion in this review. Of these, one was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Takagi-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Takagi 1976</LINK>) because the trial included women with blood loss less than 500 mL and the trial report did not allow analysis based on treatment allocation ('intention to treat'). Seven misoprostol trials were included in the review. Four placebo-controlled trials compared misoprostol (at doses of 600 to 1000 mcg) versus placebo (1881 participants) among women receiving conventional uterotonics for primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walraven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walraven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Widmer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Widmer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuberi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zuberi 2008</LINK>).

The main objective of these studies was to assess the effectiveness of the randomly selected drug to stop PPH within 20 minutes and/or to result in additional blood loss of at least 300 mL.

All participants with PPH &gt; 500 mL were managed according to French practice guidelines: bladder catheter, manual removal of retained placenta, genital tract examination, uterine exploration and oxytocin (30 U/30 min), followed, and if these procedures were inefficacious, sulprostone was administered (500 &#956;g in one hour) with no procoagulant treatment.

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Lokugamage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lokugamage 2001</LINK> trial compared misoprostol (800 mcg rectal) versus syntometrine combined with oxytocin infusion for treatment of PPH. The authors described clearly the random generation method and allocation concealment using consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. It was a single-blinded study, as obstetricians were aware of the type of drug given, although women and midwives were not. The trial authors indicated that single blinding was used mainly for safety "to prevent over-dosage and to know what had been given in case of need of additional drugs". No description was provided of the method of measurement of blood loss or the management of the third stage of labour. The authors have been contacted to request more information. Post-randomisation withdrawal of one woman (1/32) was reported in the misoprostol arm. The trial was prone to assessment bias, as physicians were aware of the treatment given. Generalisation of the results (external validity) is somewhat limited because effectiveness outcomes such as 'treatment failure' were susceptible to biased ascertainment. Furthermore, the authors performed an interim analysis after 12 months (30 recruited women), and it is unclear whether this information was shared with the clinicians participating in the trial. Therefore, one cannot rule out the possibility that postrandomisation management and outcome assessment were influenced by knowledge of interim results. The study was terminated after an interim analysis revealed an 80% difference between the two treatment arms for the pre-specified outcome measure (effectiveness at stopping PPH within 20 minutes of trial drugs' administration). Only three outcome measures were adequately reported (hysterectomy, persistent vaginal bleeding following randomisation, medical and surgical co-interventions). Maternal death was not reported as an outcome. Other reported outcome measures included blood transfusion, length of inpatient stay and drug side effects. However, they were reported as "P value of significance" with no numbers or percentages. No long-term outcome data were presented.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Walraven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walraven 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK> trials were double-blinded studies that compared misoprostol (600 mcg in Walraven and 1000 mcg in Hofmeyr, delivered by multiple routes) versus placebo when used as an adjunct to standard uterotonics for the treatment of primary PPH. However, the authors of the former trial believed that blinding may have been compromised by differences in the size of the misoprostol tablets and the placebo. Both trials used active management of the third stage of labour and measured blood loss after administration of conventional oxytocics for primary PPH treatment and the trial drug. In <LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK>, six of 244 data sheets did not include pack numbers and could not be included in the analysis. In the <LINK REF="STD-Walraven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Walraven 2004</LINK> trial, no withdrawals after enrolment were reported. No long-term outcome data were presented.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Zuberi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zuberi 2008</LINK> trial was a multi-centre double-blind randomised controlled study that compared sublingual misoprostol (600 mcg) versus placebo when used as an adjunct to standard uterotonics for the treatment of primary PPH. Blinding and allocation concealment were adequate, and participants were randomly assigned in blocks of 10, using a computer-generated random sequence. Placebo tablets were identical in shape, colour, weight, feel and taste to misoprostol tablets. The study was powered to recruit 900 participants; however, investigators managed to recruit only 61 participants and reported results for 59 of them. The primary outcome measure was measured blood loss of 500 mL or more after treatment. Authors indicated that accurate use of the scales for assessment of blood loss proved difficult. Therefore, volume of blood was not analysed; instead measurement according to reading of the blood collection device was recorded and analysed. No long-term outcome data were presented.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Widmer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Widmer 2010</LINK> trial was a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled study that compared sublingual misoprostol (600 mcg) versus placebo when used as an adjunct to standard uterotonics for the treatment of primary PPH. Investigators used computer-generated randomisation sequence in blocks of six and eight, stratified by country. Overall, blinding and allocation concealment were adequate. Placebo tablets were identical in shape, colour, weight, feel and taste to misoprostol tablets. A total of 1422 women were recruited to the study, three women did not receive interventions and five women were lost to follow-up at 90 minutes, as blood loss was not recorded. The study was powered to measure impact on blood loss. Methods of blood collection and measurement varied between centres. However, trial authors indicated that some of the methods used had been previously evaluated in the World Health Organization trial of misoprostol for the prevention of PPH (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2001</LINK>). Both groups received standard uterotonics for the treatment of primary PPH. No long-term outcome data were presented.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Blum-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blum 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Winikoff-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Winikoff 2010</LINK> trials were double-blind randomised controlled trials that compared sublingual misoprostol (800 mcg) versus oxytocin infusion (40 IU in one 1000 mL of saline over 15 minutes). Both described clearly their methods of allocation concealment and blinding and used similar inclusion and exclusion criteria. Placebo tablets were identical in shape, colour, weight, feel and taste to misoprostol tablets. However, the latter trial included only participants for whom oxytocic drugs were not administered during the second and third stages of labour. They used cessation of active bleeding within 20 minutes after initial treatment and additional blood loss of 300 mL or more as primary end points and reported outcomes in 100% of cases. No long-term outcome data were reported.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Ducloy_x002d_Bouthors-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ducloy-Bouthors 2011</LINK> trial was an open-label randomised, controlled study. It was liable to selection and performance bias. Partial blinding was achieved, as obstetricians, midwives and participants were not aware of interventions used. However, anaesthetists were aware of the intervention and were responsible for randomisation and administration of the trial drug. It is unclear how the allocated intervention was concealed, as intravenous infusion would be visible to all. Investigators recruited 152 participants, but one was excluded, as it was found later that she did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Protocol violations were reported for seven women (five in the tranexamic acid group and two in the control group), and the analysis reported on 144 participants (72 participants in each group). The study was not powered to measure any of our primary outcome measures. Investigators reported few long-term outcome data.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2006</LINK> trial was a randomised controlled study in which women were randomly assigned to conventional therapy versus estrogen adjuvant therapy in addition to conventional therapy.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-09 13:53:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>The current review evaluated 10 clinical trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. None was adequately powered to address our primary outcome measures. Seven uterotonics trials evaluated the use of misoprostol for the treatment of primary PPH. Data from this review show that when misoprostol was compared with placebo (four clinical trials), intravenous oxytocin (two trials) or combined oxytocin and ergometrine (one trial), no statistically significant differences were seen in clinically important outcomes including maternal mortality, serious maternal morbidity, admission to intensive care and hysterectomy. Secondary outcomes, such as blood loss greater than 1000 mL and use of additional uterotonics, favoured intravenous oxytocin over misoprostol. The review suggests that conventional primary PPH treatment with intravenous oxytocin should be recommended as the more effective treatment.</P>
<P>The occurrence of five maternal deaths in the group of studies comparing misoprostol versus placebo is unexpected (5/930 versus 0/930; RR 6.16; 95% CI 0.75 to 50.85). This prompted Hofmeyr and colleagues to examine the frequency of maternal deaths among 40,000 participants in 46 clinical trials of misoprostol used for the prevention or treatment of PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). Of 11 maternal deaths reported in five clinical trials, eight occurred in women receiving misoprostol (odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.13; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). Subsequent trials comparing sublingual misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin for treatment of primary PPH (<LINK REF="STD-Blum-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blum 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winikoff-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Winikoff 2010</LINK>) have been more reassuring, with one maternal death reported in each group (1/895 versus 1/895; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.74). Furthermore, another recent randomised trial comparing misoprostol versus placebo for PPH prevention reported no maternal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Mobeen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mobeen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid has been used for the prevention of haemorrhage for quite some time (<LINK REF="REF-CRASH_x002d_2-trial-collaborators-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRASH-2 trial collaborators 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novikova-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novikova 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peitsidis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peitsidis 2011</LINK>), but <LINK REF="STD-Ducloy_x002d_Bouthors-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ducloy-Bouthors 2011</LINK> was the first published randomised trial that examined the use of tranexamic acid to treat primary PPH. The study is underpowered to assess any impact on pre-specified primary outcome measures. The <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2006</LINK> trial of estrogen adjuvant therapy was not big enough to evaluate the impact on primary and secondary outcomes. In the absence of any pharmacological studies to support this current approach, it is sensible to avoid any estrogen therapy for PPH, especially as risk of deep vein thrombosis is increased in the immediate postpartum period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chantrapitak-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chantrapitak 2009</LINK> described two new techniques to control blood loss through transabdominal compression of the lower uterine segment. These techniques appear simple and safe, do not require special skills and have no major side effects. Unfortunately, the authors did not specify which technique they used during the trial period. Lower uterine segment compression was associated with a modest reduction in mean blood loss and blood loss of at least 500 mL. The method warrants further evaluation, as it could be of considerable benefit in the management of women who develop primary PPH following home birth and require hospital transfer for further management.</P>
<P>We focused on four parameters to evaluate the impact of PPH treatments on postrandomisation blood loss: (1) blood loss of at least 500 mL; (2) blood loss of at least 1000 mL; (3) blood transfusion and (4) mean blood loss after enrolment. In this regard, misoprostol provided no additional benefit when compared with placebo when given to women simultaneously treated with conventional uterotonics. Misoprostol was evaluated as an effective and easy to administer alternative to intravenous oxytocin as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary PPH in two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blum-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blum 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winikoff-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Winikoff 2010</LINK>). Compared with 40 IU oxytocin infusion, 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in the number of women who had blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75), blood transfusion (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.14) and mean blood loss (mL) (MD 44.86, 95% CI 26.50, 63.22). Therefore, where available, oxytocin infusion should be recommended as first-line treatment for primary PPH. Lack of significant differences in primary outcomes suggests that, when oxytocin infusion is not available, sublingual misoprostol may serve as a valid alternative for providers seeking a uterotonic therapy for their patients. No significant difference was reported between tranexamic acid and placebo in the <LINK REF="STD-Ducloy_x002d_Bouthors-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ducloy-Bouthors 2011</LINK> study in terms of women who had blood loss of at least 500 mL or at least 1000 mL. This is consistent with the results of two systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novikova-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novikova 2010</LINK>) that evaluated the use of tranexamic acid for the prevention of PPH.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-06 15:23:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Several potential reasons may explain why misoprostol randomised trials have not confirmed optimistic preliminary results from observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdel-Aleem 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adekanmi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adekanmi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oboro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oboro 2003</LINK>). In previous reports, blood loss was subjectively assessed, but in the seven trials included in this review, blood loss was measured objectively. This is particularly important, as lack of blinding in previous studies may have affected the perception of effectiveness. The pharmacokinetics of misoprostol may also be a contributing factor: Variation in the route and dose of administration may result in significant variation in plasma therapeutic levels of the drug. Current evidence suggests that the oral route provides the advantage of rapid onset of action, although the vaginal and rectal routes confer the advantage of prolonged activity and greater bioavailability. The sublingual route possesses both of these advantages with a rapid onset of action, prolonged activity and greater bioavailability (<LINK REF="REF-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdel-Aleem 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andolina-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andolina 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Danielsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danielsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zieman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zieman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Misoprostol intake was associated with a significant increase in prostaglandin-mediated side effects including maternal pyrexia (at least 38°C or at least 40°C), vomiting and shivering. Side effects appear to be dose dependent. Maternal pyrexia, in particular, is very rare when low-dose misoprostol is used for induction of labour or termination of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2010</LINK>). These side effects appear to be associated with high doses of misoprostol and may impact the management of patients with major obstetrical haemorrhage. For instance, blood transfusion forms an essential part of fluid resuscitation in women with major PPH, and a rise in body temperature following misoprostol use could be incorrectly labelled as a &#8220;transfusion reaction&#8221;, with subsequent stoppage of transfusion having a major impact on the general condition of the patient. Similarly, maternal pyrexia could mistakenly be labelled as &#8220;maternal sepsis&#8221;, which may result in the commencement of unnecessary intravenous antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>Three cases of deep vein thrombosis were reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Ducloy_x002d_Bouthors-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ducloy-Bouthors 2011</LINK> study: two in the tranexamic acid group and one in the control group (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.57). It is difficult to draw any conclusion regarding safety and risk of thromboembolic complications after tranexamic acid administration. It is noteworthy that several large studies did not observe any significant increase in the risk of thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-CRASH_x002d_2-trial-collaborators-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRASH-2 trial collaborators 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peitsidis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peitsidis 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this current update, we have not included postrandomisation haemoglobin level or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) as an outcome of interest for several reasons. First, blood and clotting factor transfusions form an essential part of any primary PPH resuscitation protocol in women with massive obstetrical haemorrhage. Therefore, a corrected haemoglobin level and/or clotting factors may simply confirm adequate resuscitation, rather than effectiveness of the uterotonics or the intervention. Second, postdelivery haemoglobin level is directly related to pre-delivery levels rather than the impact of intervention on blood loss. Ideally, one should measure the drop in haemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels before delivery and the first blood transfusion. However, as primary PPH occurs unexpectedly, often among low-risk women, pre-delivery haemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels usually are not available. The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Winikoff-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Winikoff 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blum-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blum 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zuberi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zuberi 2008</LINK> have set an example by checking haemoglobin concentration for all labouring women before birth and after administration of the trial drug. However, this will be very difficult to replicate in other large pragmatic trials. Currently, lack of agreement has been noted between clinicians regarding the definition of DIC (<LINK REF="REF-Gando-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gando 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two excluded quasi-randomised trials from the same centre (<LINK REF="STD-Soltan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Soltan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soltan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Soltan 2010</LINK>) evaluated the use of external aortic compression devices in addition to conventional therapy in the treatment of primary PPH. Investigators observed less blood transfusion when this device was used (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.66), but the studies were too small to show an impact on other substantive outcomes. Although the use of external aortic compression devices was associated with abdominal discomfort and numbness and a tingling sensation, the lack of any short- or long-term Ischaemic manifestations was quite reassuring. Currently, interest in evaluating the non-pneumatic antishock garment (NASG) is growing, especially in low-resource areas. With brief training, it appears that individuals without a medical background can use this first-aid device. Miller and colleagues examined the use of NASG in a pre-intervention/intervention study involving 1442 participants with hypovolaemic shock secondary to obstetrical haemorrhage from any cause and an estimated blood loss of at least 750 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2010</LINK>). The NASG intervention was associated with a significant reduction in measured blood loss, maternal mortality, severe morbidities and emergency hysterectomy.</P>
<P>The question related to the management of women with major primary PPH who remain unresponsive to medical management with uterotonics and/or tranexamic acid therapy remains largely unanswered. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, clinicians are left to make their own judgement on the best combination of surgical, radiological and/or pharmaceutical interventions to control bleeding. Large double-blind, multi-centre, randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of surgical interventions and/or radiological interventions on the primary outcome measures; however, the inability to obtain informed consent from critically ill patients may make it difficult to recruit participants. Clinicians should be encouraged to conduct such trials provided that they are able to follow agreed procedures for getting consent from critically ill patients and to ensure that recruitment does not interfere with standard clinical management.</P>

<P>Primary PPH is a life-threatening condition and availability of first-aid treatment (IV line, parenteral fluids and uterotonics) is crucial. Current evidence suggests that intravenous oxytocin should be used as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary PPH due to uterine atony. Evidence suggests that misoprostol is less effective than oxytocin and provides no additional uterotonic effect when used simultaneously with conventional oxytocin treatment. Efforts should be made to make injectable oxytocin available for use at deliveries occurring outside of facilities. When injectable oxytocin is not available, misoprostol can be used.</P>
<P>Variation in dose regimens between the seven different misoprostol studies made it difficult for the review authors to draw clear conclusions regarding the most effective dose or route. As first-line treatment, the largest body of evidence available supports the safety and effectiveness of an 800-mcg sublingual dose. As an adjunct treatment to standard oxytocin infusion, various routes were examined, but none proved to be beneficial, so no regimen is suggested at this time. In general, the use of higher doses should be balanced against the likelihood of a greater incidence of maternal side effects associated with misoprostol. A system of "adverse event registration" might be helpful in identifying and tracking serious maternal morbidity and mortality associated with the use of all uterotonics in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Use of tranexamic acid in routine clinical practice is under investigation. The results of one ongoing trial, the WOMAN trial, should be large enough to provide information on the effectiveness and safety of this drug for women with primary PPH (<LINK REF="STD-Shakur-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shakur 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lower segment compression is a simple and promising method, particularly when unwell patients with major haemorrhage are transferred between centres in low-resource settings, where access to blood services is limited. Results from field studies of these methods will be included in a future review.</P>
<P>We are unable to provide any guidance regarding the management of women with primary PPH who fail to respond to uterotonics and/or haemostatic drug therapies. However, it is logical to consider conservative surgical techniques and/or radiological interventions in an effort to avoid hysterectomy. The main challenge is to ensure that adequate clinical expertise is available at all times to determine when the conservative approach should be abandoned in favour of hysterectomy in a timely fashion.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-06 15:17:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality studies with adequate power are urgently needed to address our primary outcome measures. Future interventions addressing management of PPH at the community level would also be useful. Studies seeking to identify appropriate uterotonic management of primary PPH following home deliveries, particularly in developing countries, are of particular interest.</P>
<P>Currently, no randomised data are available on the effectiveness of carbetocin, a long-acting synthetic oxytocin analogue, but recent reports suggest that it may be of benefit in the prevention of primary PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2012</LINK>) and, therefore, further research would be justified.</P>
<P>Three areas of research would be of particular interest for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics. First, further work is needed to identify the most effective tamponade procedures and uterine haemostatic suturing techniques in women with major primary PPH. Second, aortic compression devices and the non-pneumatic antishock garment should be tested further in patients with major obstetrical haemorrhage. Finally, the benefits of interventional radiology for women at increased risk of bleeding during delivery and for those who bleed following childbirth should be critically evaluated in randomised trials. Ideally, first-line uterotonics and second-line surgical intervention trials should be conducted in both developed and developing countries.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Original sample size calculation: 142 participants needed to be recruited. However, the first year interim analysis, which included 15 participants per study arm, showed that misoprostol performed best. The decision was made to terminate the study after recruitment of 64 participants, as the difference between the 2 treatment regimens reached statistical significance with power in excess of 80%.</P>
<P>As the study is a single-blinded study, the interim results may have influenced clinicians' management.</P>
