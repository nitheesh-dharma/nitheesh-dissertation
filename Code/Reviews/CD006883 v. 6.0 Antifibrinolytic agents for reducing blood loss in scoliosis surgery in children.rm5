<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Scoliosis is a curving of the spine beyond that which is normal. Surgery may be needed to correct scoliosis and is often carried out when the child is young. Substantial bleeding may occur during surgery and can lead to serious complications, such as multiple organ failure. Many methods are used to reduce blood loss, including drugs that modify clotting pathways in the body. Medications known as antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce bleeding by preventing the breakdown of a blood clot. This review is an update of a review published in 2008, which looked at how well these drugs work, and how safe they are.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>This review is an update of a review that we first published in 2008. Our latest search for articles took place in August 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The antifibrinolytic drugs evaluated in this systematic review were aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid. We found nine studies that enrolled a total of 455 participants, aged 18 years or younger, who received either antifibrinolytic drugs or a placebo.</P>
<P>Total enrolment in each study ranged from 36 participants to 80 participants. Two of the studies evaluated aprotinin, four tranexamic acid and four aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid. The other studies administered placebo to the control group. Studies that evaluated aprotinin and aminocaproic acid used high doses (when reported). Of the studies that evaluated tranexamic acid, two used high doses, one used low doses and one did not describe the dose given. Five studies evaluated idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis with no known cause), and four evaluated both idiopathic scoliosis and scoliosis that occurred as the result of another disease, such as cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>Of the nine included studies, five reported how long patients were assessed. Follow-up ranged from one to 10 days after surgery, or lasted for the participant's length of stay in the hospital.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>Two studies received grants from organizations of healthcare professionals, and one was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The remaining studies did not report sources of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Antifibrinolytic drugs reduced the amount of blood lost during, or immediately after, surgery, by 427 millilitres (mL) (more than a 20% reduction in blood loss) and the amount of blood transfused during the same period by 327 mL. The number of children who received transfusions, either through blood from a donor or through a combination of blood from a donor and their own saved blood, was also significantly decreased. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all of these findings as low or very low because of the small numbers of participants, some concerns about study designs and imprecision in study findings.</P>
<P>No children included in any studies died, and very few adverse events were reported, although three children receiving placebo in one study developed a clot. However, these studies may not have adequately looked for adverse events, or study authors might not have reported them fully. Also, the number of children evaluated was too small and the time of follow-up too short to allow review authors to draw any conclusions about their safety.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>This systematic review showed that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce blood loss and decrease the number of children receiving blood transfusions and the amount of blood transfused, but the evidence supporting any of these findings is not very strong. The safety of antifibrinolytic drugs remains unclear.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2008. Scoliosis surgery is often associated with substantial blood loss and potentially detrimental effects in children. Antifibrinolytic agents are often used to reduce perioperative blood loss. Clinical trials have evaluated their efficacy in children undergoing surgical correction of scoliosis, but no systematic review has been published. This review was first published in 2008 and was updated in 2016.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-20 16:23:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing surgery for correction of idiopathic or secondary scoliosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We ran the search for the previous review in June 2007. For this updated version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1 2015), Embase (1947 to 2015 week 38), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 14 August 2015), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; 2015, Issue 2) and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials in any language. We also checked the clinical trial registry at <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.go">http://www.clinicaltrials.go</A>v on 8 October 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of antifibrinolytics on perioperative blood loss in children 18 years of age or younger and undergoing scoliosis surgery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome was total blood loss (intraoperative and postoperative combined). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the number of participants receiving blood transfusion (both autologous and allogeneic) or receiving allogeneic blood transfusion alone, and the total amount of blood transfused. Safety outcomes included the number of deaths, the number of participants reporting any adverse event or a serious adverse event, withdrawals due to adverse events and the number of participants experiencing a specific adverse event (i.e. renal insufficiency, hypersensitivity or thrombosis). We assessed methodological risk of bias for each included study and employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-09 17:07:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included three new studies (201 participants) in this updated review, for a total of nine studies (455 participants). All but one study employed placebo as the control group intervention. For the primary outcome, antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the amount of perioperative blood loss by 427 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 251 to 603 mL), for a reduction of over 20% versus placebo. We rated the quality of evidence for our primary outcome as low on the basis of unclear risk of bias for several domains in most studies and the small total number of participants.</P>
<P>
<BR/>For secondary outcomes, fewer participants receiving antifibrinolytic drugs received transfusion (allogeneic or autologous) versus those receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85, number needed to treat to prevent one additional harmful outcome (NNTp) 5; very low-quality evidence). Only two studies specifically evaluated the number of participants transfused with only allogeneic blood (risk difference (RD) -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03, NNTp 7; very low-quality evidence). Antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the volume of blood transfused by 327 mL (95% CI -186 to -469 mL; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>No study reported deaths in active or control groups. Data were insufficient to allow performance of meta-analysis for any safety outcome. No studies adequately described their methods in assessing safety. The only adverse event of note occurred in one study, when three participants in the placebo group developed postoperative deep vein thrombosis.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last published version of this review (2008), we have found three new studies. Additional evidence shows that antifibrinolytics reduce the requirement for both autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion. Limited evidence of low to very low quality supports the use of antifibrinolytic drugs for reducing blood loss and decreasing the risk, and volume, of transfusion in children undergoing scoliosis surgery. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of a particular agent, although tranexamic acid may be preferred, given its widespread availability. The optimal dose regimen for any of these three agents has not been established. Although adverse events appear to occur infrequently, evidence is insufficient to confirm the safety of these agents, particularly for rare but potentially catastrophic events. No long-term safety data are available.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-05 16:43:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a review previously published in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> on antifibrinolytic agents for reducing blood loss in scoliosis surgery in children (<LINK REF="REF-Tzortzopoulou-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tzortzopoulou 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Scoliosis is a complex lateral and rotational deformity of the thoracolumbar spine (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Hawary-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Hawary 2014</LINK>). It may be primary and idiopathic, which implies an unknown origin, although with a probable genetic basis, or secondary owing to congenital, neurological or musculoskeletal disorders. On the basis of age of onset, idiopathic scoliosis is further subdivided into infantile (children aged three years and younger), juvenile (children three to ten years old) and adolescent (older than 10 years to 18 years old). It may be further subclassified as early (before five years of age) or late onset (after five years of age), given that the natural history, rate of occurrence and approaches to treatment for patients younger than five years of age differ from those for patients older than five years. Idiopathic scoliosis accounts for 80% of all cases. In contrast to secondary scoliosis, idiopathic scoliosis may occur in otherwise healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Negrini--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Negrini 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prognosis of scoliosis is related to its origin and speed of progression. The prognosis is improved when treated early, while deformities are still mild, and before secondary deformities are established (<LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 2006</LINK>). The degree of deformity determines the optimal approach to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Hawary-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Hawary 2014</LINK>). Observation is recommended for patients with a Cobb angle (a measure of severity of spinal deformity) of 25º or less, and a brace is recommended for patients with curves between 25º and 45º; surgery is generally reserved for patients with curvature greater than 50º in the thoracic spine or 40º in the lumbar spine, and for those in whom scoliosis is progressing. Uncorrected, scoliosis results in curve progression, cosmetic deformity, back pain and respiratory compromise. The aims of surgical intervention are to prevent progression, improve posture and back pain and prevent further deterioration of restrictive lung defects.</P>
<P>Despite great improvements in the surgical techniques used to treat patients with scoliosis, these are frequently lengthy operations with substantial blood loss that can lead to serious adverse events. Factors influencing blood loss include neuromuscular origin of scoliosis, platelet dysfunction, poor nutritional status, severity of scoliosis, poor vascular vasoconstrictive response, increased bleeding time and fibrinolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Brenn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fievez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fievez 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forst 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noordeen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noordeen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turturro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turturro 2005</LINK>). Secondary scoliosis is frequently a result of neuromuscular disorders such as spina bifida, spastic cerebral palsy and spinal muscular dystrophy. Many of these patients have learning and intellectual disabilities, impaired gross motor dexterity, swallowing difficulties, incontinence, chronic infections and overall poor nutritional status. Anaemia is thus very common in this population. No evidence suggests that patients with cerebral palsy have coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction. Overall, clinically, these patients have a poor baseline health status, reduced physiological reserve and healing capacity and a greater propensity for perioperative bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reilly-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reilly 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wass-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wass 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Substantial blood loss mandates volume repletion with crystalloid, colloid or blood products. Infusion of intravenous fluids for blood replacement following massive bleeding can lead to hypothermia and haemodilution. Haemodilution dilutes haemoglobin as well as coagulation factors; this leads to worsened surgical bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Sethna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sethna 2005</LINK>), attenuated oxygen transport to tissues and acid-base balance disorders. Blood transfused may be allogeneic (from another donor) or autologous (donated by the patient before surgery). Allogeneic blood transfusions are associated with risk of infection from the donor and from microbial contamination introduced during blood processing, allergic reactions, volume overload and immunosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Luban-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luban 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roback-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roback 2007</LINK>). Although autologous transfusion is associated with less risk of infection, other factors such as venous access, distress from the pain of multiple venipunctures, delay of surgery to allow blood collection and regeneration and low preoperative haematocrit levels hinder or limit the collection of autologous blood from children (<LINK REF="REF-Booke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mezrow-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mezrow 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takemura-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takemura 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2003</LINK>). Additional methods to reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion include intraoperative "cell saving" and methods that decrease intraoperative bleeding such as acute normovolemic haemodilution, controlled hypotension, maintenance of low intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, infiltration of local vasoconstrictors and administration of systemic drugs such as desmopressin, recombinant factor VIIa and antifibrinolytics (<LINK REF="REF-Cardone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardone 2009</LINK>). Intraoperative cell saving refers to autotransfusion of shed blood. This is accomplished with blood processing devices that aspirate, anticoagulate, wash and re-infuse the cell suspension to the patient; or that directly re-infuse unwashed filtered blood (<LINK REF="REF-Carrier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrier 2006</LINK>

<U>; </U>
<LINK REF="REF-Niranjan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niranjan 2006</LINK>). Acute normovolemic haemodilution refers to the rapid removal of the patient's own blood right before surgery and its preoperative replacement with crystalloid or colloid to maintain normovolaemia. This blood can then be re-infused intraoperatively or postoperatively as needed (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiskopf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiskopf 2001</LINK>). This approach is widely used in children to minimize the need for intraoperative allogeneic blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaller-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaller 1984</LINK>). Controlled hypotension (mean arterial pressure 30% lower than baseline) is not commonly used intraoperatively owing to the risk of hypoperfusion to vital organs including the spinal cord. Risk of ischaemic optic neuropathy is also increased. Appropriate patient selection and careful monitoring are vital for implementation of this technique (<LINK REF="REF-Barcelona-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barcelona 2005</LINK>). Modified mechanical ventilatory parameters and correct positioning of the patient on supportive frames may help avoid excessive intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures that would lead to impaired ventilation, reduced venous return and increased extradural vein volume with subsequent increased bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Rafique-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rafique 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Relton-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Relton 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soliman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soliman 1998</LINK>). Infiltration of paraspinal muscles with agents such as adrenaline produces local vasoconstriction. The use of drugs such as desmopressin and antihaemophilic factors could, in theory, also decrease surgical bleeding by modifying the coagulation cascade (<LINK REF="REF-Szpalski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szpalski 2004</LINK>
<U>)</U>. Finally, the use of antifibrinolytics may reduce allogeneic transfusion requirements.</P>

<P>Antifibrinolytics reduce perioperative bleeding by inhibiting fibrin degradation. Fibrin provides the basic framework for formation of a blood clot (<LINK REF="STD-Neilipovitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Neilipovitz 2001</LINK>). The most commonly used antifibrinolytic drugs are aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid.

Evidence from three observational studies and from a single randomized study, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, show increased risk of perioperative renal dysfunction, cardiovascular events, pulmonary embolism and death with aprotinin, leading to its withdrawal from many national markets in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Bremerich-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bremerich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangano 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royston-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royston 2015</LINK>). Although these data have been revisited and reanalyzed, bringing into question the findings of the four studies, aprotinin remains unavailable in many countries or has been given a restricted license for myocardial revascularization only (<LINK REF="REF-Royston-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royston 2015</LINK>). Increased risk of mortality has not been demonstrated with the other antifibrinolytics.</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) are synthetic lysine analogues that competitively inhibit activation of plasminogen to plasmin, a molecule responsible for the degradation of fibrin (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>); comparative potency estimates vary (<LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antifibrinolytic drugs are administered intravenously after induction of anaesthesia. Usually a loading dose is given over 15 to 20 minutes and is followed by continuous infusion. High doses appear to be more effective than low doses (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the use of antifibrinolytic drugs to reduce perioperative blood loss in adults undergoing cardiac or orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2006</LINK>). Findings from cardiac surgery studies are not easily generalized to other types of surgery, such as scoliosis surgery, because use of heparin and extracorporeal bypass during cardiac surgery predisposes to bleeding.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-09 17:07:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>For our earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Tzortzopoulou-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tzortzopoulou 2008b</LINK>), we judged the quality of studies on the basis of method of randomization, method of allocation concealment, blinding of the study, completeness of follow-up and use of an intention-to-treat analysis (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this updated review, two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of all included studies by using a domain-based evaluation, as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the following for each study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as having low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or unclear risk of bias (method not adequately described).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (selection bias). We assessed whether allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or could have changed after assignment. We assessed these methods as having low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes); or unclear risk of bias (method not adequately described).</LI>
<LI>Blinding (detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they stated that they were blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding (e.g. identical packaging; matched in appearance and colour), or at unclear risk if they stated that they were blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how this was achieved. We included unblinded studies and studies where authors did not mention blinding, and assessed these as having high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). We assessed the methods used to handle missing outcome data as having low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcomes; missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups); high risk of bias (reasons for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcomes, with imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; &#8216;as-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization); or unclear risk of bias (method not adequately described).</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias). We assessed reporting of results as having low risk of bias (e.g. the study protocol was available and all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes of interest in the review were reported in the prespecified way; the study protocol was not available but it is clear that published reports included all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified); high risk of bias (e.g. not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified primary outcomes were reported; one or more primary outcomes were reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of data that were not prespecified); or unclear risk of bias (information insufficient to permit judgement of &#8216;low risk&#8217; or &#8216;high risk&#8217;).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For our updated review, we also assessed risk of bias due to sample size: Studies were considered to have low risk of bias if they included 200 or more participants per treatment arm; unclear risk if they included 50 to 199 participants per treatment arm; and high risk if they included fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2012</LINK>).</P>

When a statistically significant risk difference was evident between interventions, we derived the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), or the number needed to treat to prevent an additional harmful outcome (NNTp) (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>).

Therefore, as in our previous review, our meta-analysis included 100 participants receiving antifibrinolytic drugs and 107 receiving placebo. We merged intraoperative and postoperative periods of evaluation and found that the results were homogeneous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Antifibrinolytic drugs decreased mean perioperative blood loss by 427 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 251 to 603 mL), for a reduction of over 20% versus placebo. Although we presented data separately for each agent (aminocaproic acid, aprotinin and tranexamic acid), numbers of participants for individual drugs were insufficient for a meaningful subgroup analysis. We rated the quality of evidence for our primary outcome as low, on the basis of unclear risk of bias for several domains in most studies and the small total number of participants (imprecision).</P>
<P>One study from our updated search (<LINK REF="STD-Halanski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Halanski 2014</LINK>) compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid and found a non-statistically significant increase in mean calculated blood loss among those receiving aminocaproic acid (mean difference (MD) 463 mL, 95% CI -155 to 1081 mL; 44 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Investigators assessed calculated blood loss by attempting to collect all blood loss into the cell saver system and weighing all sponges. They calculated blood loss by subtracting the volume of heparinised saline from the total volume in the cell saver system and the average dry sponge weight from blood-soaked sponges. They then combined these values to determine total blood loss. For the two participants in whom a postoperative suction drain was used (both received aminocaproic acid), they added this volume to the calculated blood loss in a separate analysis. This analysis increased the calculated mean blood loss in the aminocaproic acid group to 1422 mL. We chose to present only intraoperative blood loss data for this comparison, as postoperative blood loss could not be calculated in those without a suction drain. Results from standard estimated blood loss (estimates made in the operating room by looking at the wound, drapes, drain canisters, sponges, etc.) demonstrated similar differences between agents, with lower estimates of mean blood loss in each group.</P>

However, both of our analyses of participants receiving transfusion (overall or allogeneic) changed from statistically significant to non-significant, reflecting heterogeneity between studies and small overall numbers. For participants receiving transfusion, the RR increased to 0.76 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.24), primarily owing to <LINK REF="STD-Moguilevitch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moguilevitch 2011</LINK>, which reported a much smaller event rate in the antifibrinolytic group than was reported by the other studies. For participants requiring allogeneic transfusion, the best point estimate for risk difference was similar to that seen when a fixed-effect model was employed (-0.14 vs -0.15, respectively), but the 95% CI included no effect, most likely explained by the difference in event rates in placebo groups between studies.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-05 16:43:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, review authors added three studies to the analysis of six studies from the original review. Analyses of mean total blood loss and mean amount of blood transfused remain unchanged from our original review, as no new studies contributed data to these comparisons. The addition of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Moguilevitch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moguilevitch 2011</LINK>) to our analysis of number of participants receiving blood transfusion increased the overall superiority (risk reduction) of antifibrinolytics versus placebo and changed our estimate from non-statistically significant to significant. However, the heterogeneity of the analysis also increased. The analysis of number of participants receiving allogeneic transfusion remained essentially unchanged, reflecting lack of available data for this outcome; we did, however, find a statistically significant absolute risk reduction between antifibrinolytics and placebo. Additionally, we made mean total blood loss our primary outcome for this updated review (as opposed to mortality and number of participants requiring transfusion - primary outcomes in our original review). We made this change as we consider total blood loss to be the most clinically significant of our explored outcomes. Mortality is rare (it did not occur in any participants in our review) and may reflect factors other than blood loss, and the number of participants transfused is dependent on the threshold for transfusion, which may differ between studies (although thresholds were similar in the studies that reported them). Factors such as variation in physician practice may also have affected transfusion rates. We formally analyzed adverse event (AE) data. However, incomplete reporting (or inadequate assessment) and the rarity with which the chosen AEs occurred precluded meaningful analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Limited evidence from our updated review suggests that aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid administered to children undergoing scoliosis surgery decrease perioperative blood loss and the amount of blood transfused. Very limited data also demonstrate a reduction in the need for transfusion with autologous or allogeneic blood<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>The decrease in mean blood loss, on average 427 mL, associated with use of antifibrinolytic drugs is clinically important, especially for children, as their blood volume is less than that of adults. This quantity is also approximately the amount of blood in a unit of blood, which suggests that antifibrinolytic drugs could decrease the risk of any transfusion, or the risk of transfusion of an additional unit. Our findings are based mainly on studies that evaluated high-dose drug regimens and, therefore, may not apply to use of lower doses.</P>
<P>Although we considered the outcome of mean blood loss as the most clinically important, other clinicians consider the risk of requiring transfusion a more relevant outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Neilipovitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Neilipovitz 2001</LINK>). Reducing the need for allogeneic transfusions should, in turn, lower the risk of infection and other complications, such as transfusion reactions or circulatory overload. However, only two studies evaluated the proportion of participants transfused with allogeneic blood, and the confidence intervals around the best point estimate for this analysis are so wide that they are compatible with both no effect and a reduction in the risk of transfusion. Other products such as fresh frozen plasma, platelets or cryoprecipitate may be administered to restore coagulation factors when massive bleeding occurs. However, this systematic review focused on blood transfusion. As noted in <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>, transfusion triggers varied between studies, potentially confounding analysis of this outcome. We were able to obtain transfusion threshold data from four of the studies included in our transfusion analyses: In three of these studies, a haemoglobin level &lt; 7 g/dL routinely triggered transfusion, and the threshold was more sensitive for high-risk patients (<LINK REF="STD-Florentino-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Florentino 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halanski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Halanski 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoshhal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khoshhal 2003</LINK>); in the fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Sethna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sethna 2005</LINK>), the transfusion trigger was haematocrit &#8804; 25% (again with a higher threshold for high-risk patients).</P>
<P>Antifibrinolytic drugs could also decrease mortality through their effect on blood loss. Although no studies reported deaths, the number of children included in our meta-analysis is very small and precludes any conclusions about drug effects on mortality. Retrospective analysis has estimated mortality rates of 1.3 deaths per 1000 patient cases in the paediatric population undergoing scoliosis surgery, with rates as high as 3.5 deaths per 1000 in those with neuromuscular scoliosis (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>). Among these deaths, a minority are estimated to be due to perioperative blood loss. Therefore, it is unlikely that small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would capture this rare but catastrophic event.</P>
<P>Results of our meta-analysis suggest that aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid are similarly effective. This assessment was based on the finding that the magnitude of their effects on different outcomes was similar in all included studies. However, the limited number of studies and the paucity of head-to-head comparisons in the present systematic review preclude confidence in this assertion. Only one study in our review performed a head-to-head analysis of antifibrinolytics (<LINK REF="STD-Halanski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Halanski 2014</LINK>) and reported that the volume of transfused allogeneic blood was greater in those receiving aminocaproic acid than in those receiving tranexamic acid. In addition, as only two studies separately reported the results for secondary scoliosis, this systematic review could not establish whether these antifibrinolytics are more effective for secondary scoliosis than for idiopathic scoliosis, as suggested in the literature. <LINK REF="STD-Sethna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sethna 2005</LINK> reported that tranexamic acid produced a statistically significant reduction in mean blood loss in participants with secondary scoliosis (vs placebo), but not in those with idiopathic scoliosis; however, researchers noted that the small number of participants in each subgroup limits conclusions that can be drawn from this result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Safety</HEADING>
<P>Similarly, the limited number of children exposed to antifibrinolytic drugs does not allow us to determine drug safety. We cannot rule out even frequent serious AEs that may be associated with their use. The safety of antifibrinolytics, especially aprotinin, in adults has been questioned. As noted, evidence suggests that adults undergoing cardiac surgery who are exposed to aprotinin have increased rates of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Royston-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royston 2015</LINK>). It is unclear whether these concerns apply to children because children do not share the same risk factors as adults for thrombotic events. A cohort study in children who had undergone cardiac surgery found no association between use of aprotinin and acute kidney failure, need for temporary dialysis, neurological complications nor mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Backer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backer 2007</LINK>). Nonetheless, for now, aprotinin has been suspended from the US market by the US Food and Drug Administration, and evidence of its safety in scoliosis surgery is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of our efficacy estimates are based on very small overall numbers of participants and, as our analysis has demonstrated, are susceptible to publication bias. Therefore, the evidence should be considered incomplete for all outcomes. Similarly, owing to the small number of studies and the very small numbers of participants in each study, subgroup analysis based on type of scoliosis or on individual agents was not possible. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate differences in efficacy based on idiopathic versus secondary scoliosis, or for one agent over another.</P>
<P>We included studies that administered aprotinin. As discussed, this drug currently is not available in many countries, including the United States, so findings from these studies are not directly applicable to practice in those countries. Similarly, aminocaproic acid is not available in many countries, including most of Europe.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-05 16:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As with all quantitative systematic reviews, meta-analyses are only as good as the data reported in each study. Efficacy data were reported differently across studies, and safety data were inadequately assessed or presented.</P>
<P>When assessing the quality of findings using GRADE, we ranked quality from low to very low across the different efficacy outcomes. Low rankings were primarily due to inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), imprecision (small sample sizes, few events, wide confidence intervals), or susceptibility to the impact of publication bias. All studies enrolled fewer than 50 participants in each arm, with an average of only 51 participants in total across studies. Small studies are likely underpowered to detect statistical differences in what may be clinically relevant effects (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2012</LINK>). As previously stated, our analyses of AEs are likely underpowered to detect notable differences, and they do not capture rare but potentially catastrophic events.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-09-05 16:15:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We restricted this review to randomized studies, thus limiting the potential for bias. Possible sources of bias that could have affected the validity of the review include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Combination of studies from different surgical populations. We planned to conduct a subgroup analysis according to whether participants had idiopathic or secondary scoliosis; however, only four studies enrolled patients with secondary scoliosis, and only two of these reported data separately for each diagnosis.</LI>
<LI>Inclusion of studies with different dosing regimens in the same analysis. Analyses of total blood loss and total blood transfused show that participants lost approximately twice as much blood and required twice the volume of blood in transfusion when a low-dose regimen of tranexamic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Neilipovitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Neilipovitz 2001</LINK>) was indirectly compared with a high-dose regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Sethna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sethna 2005</LINK>). However, these studies reported similar differences between placebo groups, suggesting that this finding may reflect a difference in study methods, rather than being due to a difference in dosing regimens. The very limited data preclude separate analyses based on dose regimens.</LI>
<LI>A fixed-effect model for statistical analysis. As stated in the Results section, the point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) for our primary analysis remained unchanged when a random-effects model was applied. Although secondary analyses became statistically insignificant when a random-effects model was used, this may reflect the small number of studies and the marginal statistical significance noted when a fixed-effect model was used, rather than a fundamental flaw in our method of analysis.</LI>
<LI>Possibility of publication bias (unpublished trials showing no benefit of antifibrinolytics over placebo). We attempted to limit this risk by searching the clinical trials registry http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. As previously mentioned, to assess the possible impact of publication bias, we calculated the number of additional participants needed in studies with zero effect to change the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to 10, which we considered the threshold for a clinically meaningful effect. All analyses of dichotomous outcomes were shown to be susceptible; therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that publication bias may have affected our findings.</LI>
<LI>Nature of analyses. Few manuscripts stated whether analyses were performed on intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol populations, and those that stated this did not describe imputation methods used. However, given the short duration of the time period of interest, dropouts were few, if any, in most of these studies.</LI>
</UL>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-05 16:43:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous systematic review that evaluated the effect of aprotinin on children undergoing cardiac surgery found that aprotinin reduced the risk of transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2006</LINK>). We were able to demonstrate such a beneficial effect in reducing allogeneic but not overall blood transfusion requirements in our meta-analysis for children undergoing scoliosis surgery. This may be explained in part by the fact that in our review, only one small study enrolling 43 participants reported this outcome for aprotinin compared with data for 626 participants in Arnold's analysis. The 2006 review also found no serious AEs but, in common with our review, the sample size was small. Therefore, we can draw no conclusions about the safety of aprotinin in children.</P>
<P>A 2011 Cochrane review that analyzed the efficacy of antifibrinolytics for minimising perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion across all surgeries in adult populations demonstrated that aprotinin was slightly more effective than tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid in reducing blood loss and receipt of blood transfusion, but with an inferior safety profile (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>). All antifibrinolytics were superior to placebo in reducing blood loss and the need for transfusion.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review of antifibrinolytic agents in children undergoing non-cardiac surgery included not only RCTs, but also retrospective studies and data from other meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Faraoni-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraoni 2014</LINK>). This 2014 review excluded studies assessing aprotinin because of its limited availability worldwide. Although meta-analysis was not performed, and despite its more relaxed inclusion criteria, findings of limited evidence to support reduced blood loss and transfusion requirements in the <LINK REF="REF-Faraoni-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraoni 2014</LINK> review were similar to ours. In addition to the limitations in evidence already discussed, review authors highlighted the lack of pharmacokinetic studies of antifibrinolytics in this population, which in part may account for the large variability in dosing regimens employed. <LINK REF="REF-Faraoni-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraoni 2014</LINK> mentioned that tranexamic acid is associated with increased risk of seizures in children undergoing cardiac surgery. Neither <LINK REF="REF-Faraoni-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faraoni 2014</LINK> nor our review found reports of seizures in included studies.</P>
<P>A systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of tranexamic acid included all types of spinal surgery (i.e. not only scoliosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>). It included the two studies of tranexamic acid in scoliosis surgery that were included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Neilipovitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Neilipovitz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sethna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sethna 2005</LINK>) and found reductions in blood loss and transfusion requirements, with no differences in safety between tranexamic acid and placebo. Of note, in contrast to our review, <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK> systematic review assessed both of the above studies as having low risk of bias for all outcomes, despite apparently using the same criteria for assessment. This may reflect the subjective nature of such assessments.</P>

<P>Since the last version of this review, additional evidence has demonstrated that antifibrinolytics reduce the requirement for both autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion. Limited evidence of low to very low quality supports the use of antifibrinolytic drugs for reducing blood loss and risk for, and volume of, transfusion in children undergoing scoliosis surgery. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of a particular agent, although tranexamic acid may be preferred, given its widespread availability. The optimal dose regimen for any of these three agents has not been established. Although adverse events appear to occur infrequently, evidence is insufficient to confirm the safety of these agents, particularly for rare but potentially catastrophic events. No long-term safety data are available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-05 14:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence demonstrating reduced blood loss and less requirement for transfusion is based on very limited numbers of participants and is susceptible to publication bias. Therefore, larger studies are required to increase the robustness of our findings. Future studies should assess head-to-head comparisons of different antifibrinolytic drugs to identify any differences in effectiveness or safety. Studies should also enrol more patients with secondary scoliosis and should report results separately for this population. Optimal dosing regimens have not been established; studies employing different regimens for the same agent will help to clarify this question. Although challenging, we also recommend that the long-term safety of antifibrinolytic drugs in children should be evaluated in view of safety concerns with some antifibrinolytic drugs when used in adults.</P>

<P>For the updated review, we retained the same efficacy outcomes but reassigned total blood loss as our primary outcome, as we considered this the most valid and clinically significant outcome for assessment of efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy. We assigned all other outcomes as secondary. In the original review, our primary outcomes were mortality and number of participants requiring transfusion, but we considered that causes of mortality are multi-factorial and that requirements for transfusion differ among studies on the basis of thresholds determined by investigators. We added new comparisons related to safety and withdrawals.</P>
<P>To bring our review up to current Cochrane methodological standards, we expanded our risk of bias assessments, added GRADE to our assessment of overall quality of evidence for explored outcomes and included summary of findings tables. Our original review assessed bias as follows.</P>
<P>A: low risk of bias - adequate allocation concealment, for example, randomization in a central office by persons unaware of participant characteristics, by accessing a computer file that can be opened only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered, or by any other explicitly described method indicative of adequate concealment.<BR/>B: moderate risk of bias - unclear allocation concealment in that study authors do not report on the allocation concealment approach at all, or report an approach that does not fall within category A.<BR/>C: high risk of bias - inadequate allocation concealment, such as alternate participants or allocation by case number or date of birth.<BR/>D: no allocation concealment used - any procedure that is entirely transparent before allocation, such as use of an open list of random numbers or another description that indicates no concealment of allocation.</P>
