<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>In perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, what are the clinical effects of using hormone therapy (HT) for a year or longer?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>HT is given for control of menopausal symptoms. It has also been used for the management and prevention of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review included 22 double-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (43,637 women). The evidence is current to September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In relatively healthy postmenopausal women, using combined continuous HT for 1 year increased the risk of a heart attack from about 2 per 1000 to between 3 and 7 per 1000, and increased the risk of venous thrombosis (blood clot) from about 2 per 1000 to between 4 and 11 per 1000. With longer use, HT also increased the risk of stroke, breast cancer, gallbladder disease and death from lung cancer.</P>
<P>Oestrogen-only HT increased the risk of venous thrombosis after 1 to 2 years' use: from 2 per 1000 to 2 to 10 per 1000. With longer use, it also increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease, but it reduced the risk of breast cancer (after 7 years' use) from 25 per 1000 to between 15 and 25 per 1000.</P>
<P>Among women over 65 years of age taking continuous combined HT, the incidence of dementia was increased.</P>
<P>Risk of fracture was the only outcome for which results showed strong evidence of clinical benefit from HT (both types).</P>
<P>Women with intolerable menopausal symptoms may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose HT, provided they do not have specific contraindications. HT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (such as breast cancer, in women with a uterus). The risk of endometrial cancer for women with a uterus who take oestrogen-only HT is well documented.</P>
<P>HT is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for preventing deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women. Although HT is considered effective for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk, for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. Data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term HT use in perimenopausal women or postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>For most studies, risk of bias was low in most domains and the overall quality of the evidence was moderate. The main limitation was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline - the age at which women are likely to consider HT for vasomotor symptoms.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-05 00:04:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormone therapy (HT) is widely provided for control of menopausal symptoms and has been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-05 19:51:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess effects of long-term HT (at least 1 year's duration) on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fracture and cognition in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women during and after cessation of treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-04 19:54:50 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases to September 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We searched the registers of ongoing trials and reference lists provided in previous studies and systematic reviews.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-05 19:51:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised double-blinded studies of HT versus placebo, taken for at least 1 year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via the oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or intranasal route.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-04 19:55:42 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the evidence by using GRADE methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-05 19:51:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 22 studies involving 43,637 women. We derived nearly 70% of the data from two well-conducted studies (HERS 1998; WHI 1998). Most participants were postmenopausal American women with at least some degree of comorbidity, and mean participant age in most studies was over 60 years. None of the studies focused on perimenopausal women.</P>
<P>In relatively healthy postmenopausal women (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease), combined continuous HT increased the risk of a coronary event (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 3 and 7 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 4 and 11 per 1000), stroke (after 3 years' use: from 6 per 1000 to between 6 and 12 per 1000), breast cancer (after 5.6 years' use: from 19 per 1000 to between 20 and 30 per 1000), gallbladder disease (after 5.6 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) and death from lung cancer (after 5.6 years' use plus 2.4 years' additional follow-up: from 5 per 1000 to between 6 and 13 per 1000).</P>
<P>Oestrogen-only HT increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (after 1 to 2 years' use: from 2 per 1000 to 2 to 10 per 1000; after 7 years' use: from 16 per 1000 to 16 to 28 per 1000), stroke (after 7 years' use: from 24 per 1000 to between 25 and 40 per 1000) and gallbladder disease (after 7 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) but reduced the risk of breast cancer (after 7 years' use: from 25 per 1000 to between 15 and 25 per 1000) and clinical fracture (after 7 years' use: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000) and did not increase the risk of coronary events at any follow-up time.</P>
<P>Women over 65 years of age who were relatively healthy and taking continuous combined HT showed an increase in the incidence of dementia (after 4 years' use: from 9 per 1000 to 11 to 30 per 1000). Among women with cardiovascular disease, use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (at 1 year's use: from 3 per 1000 to between 3 and 29 per 1000). Women taking HT had a significantly decreased incidence of fracture with long-term use.</P>
<P>Risk of fracture was the only outcome for which strong evidence showed clinical benefit derived from HT (after 5.6 years' use of combined HT: from 111 per 1000 to between 79 and 96 per 1000; after 7.1 years' use of oestrogen-only HT: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000). Researchers found no strong evidence that HT has a clinically meaningful impact on the incidence of colorectal cancer.</P>
<P>One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy women 50 to 59 years of age who were taking combined continuous HT and 1637 who were taking oestrogen-only HT versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT: Their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, other differences in risk cannot be excluded, as this study was not designed to have the power to detect differences between groups of women within 10 years of menopause.</P>
<P>For most studies, risk of bias was low in most domains. The overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons was moderate. The main limitation in the quality of evidence was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline, which is the age at which women are most likely to consider HT for vasomotor symptoms.</P>

HT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (such as breast cancer, in women with a uterus). The risk of endometrial cancer among women with a uterus taking oestrogen-only HT is well documented.</P>
<P>HT is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for prevention of deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women. Although HT is considered effective for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. Data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term HT use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-05 19:02:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The median age at onset of menopause varies across geographical regions. In Europe, it ranges from about 50 to 53 years, in North America from 50 to 51 years, in Latin America from 44 to 53 years and in Asia from 42 to 49 years (<LINK REF="REF-Palacios-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palacios 2010</LINK>). Most women experience menopause (the last menstrual period) after a phase of changing ovarian function (the perimenopause) that may last several years and is characterised by irregular menstrual cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Greendale-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greendale 1999</LINK>). Women are said to be postmenopausal when menstruation has ceased for 12 months. Many (although not all) perimenopausal and postmenopausal women report a variety of symptoms, including hot flushes and vaginal dryness, which probably relate to the natural decline in oestrogen levels. Symptoms tend to fluctuate and their severity varies greatly between individuals, with some reporting intense discomfort and a substantial reduction in quality of life. Most research has focused on white women, but the experience of menopause differs between women of different races and ethnicities, as well as by menopausal stage (<LINK REF="REF-Avis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palacios-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palacios 2010</LINK>). The duration of regular hot flushes is highly variable. Most women report that hot flushes last from 6 months to 2 years (<LINK REF="REF-Kronenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kronenberg 1994</LINK>), but longitudinal research suggests that the time from onset to resolution of symptoms is often considerably longer (<LINK REF="REF-Guthrie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthrie 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-05 00:33:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormone therapy (HT) consists of oestrogen alone (oestrogen-only HT) or oestrogen combined with a progestogen (combined HT). It is available in a variety of formulations and doses that can be taken orally, vaginally or intranasally, or as an implant, skin patch, cream or gel. Clinical effects vary according to the type of HT and its duration of use.</P>
<P>The addition of a progestogen reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia associated with the use of oestrogen alone in women with a uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Furness-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furness 2012</LINK>), but the issue is problematic because progestogens have adverse effects on blood lipids and may have the potential to cause symptoms such as headache, bloating and breast tenderness (<LINK REF="REF-McKinney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinney 1998</LINK>). Progestogens used for HT include synthetic derivatives of progesterone, synthetic derivatives of testosterone and natural progesterones derived from plants. These differ in their metabolic action and potential for adverse effects, and it is currently unclear which type of progestogen has the best risk-benefit profile for use in HT. In combined HT, progestogen can be taken continuously (every day), sequentially (for part of each month) or less frequently.</P>
<P>Hormone therapy (HT) has been utilised for over 50 years for the treatment of women with hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms, and its efficacy is well established, as evidenced by a Cochrane systematic review of 24 randomised controlled studies of HT for hot flushes that was published between 1971 and 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>During the past 25 years, HT has also been used for the management or prevention of chronic disease. Oestrogens and progestogens affect most body systems and have been proposed as causing or preventing a wide range of conditions. Recommendations for use have varied over time, but through the 1990s, commonly held expert opinion was that most postmenopausal women could benefit from HT (<LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 2000a</LINK>). This view was based on strong and consistent observational evidence that HT reduced the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) by at least 30%. A meta-analysis of 25 cohort, case-control and angiographic studies published up to 1997 revealed a risk ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.75) for CHD among oestrogen users compared with never-users.</P>
<P>Other benefits reported in observational studies of HT include strong evidence of a reduction in osteoporotic fractures, a possible preventive or delaying effect on cognitive decline or dementia and even a reduction in overall mortality for current users (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett-Connor 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-05 00:34:42 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oestrogen has a favourable effect on some biomarkers, including indicators of cardiovascular disease and disorders of bone metabolism. It has been shown to improve endothelial vasodilator function, promote angiogenesis and modulate autonomic function. Thus cardioprotective benefits of oestrogen have some biological plausibility <I>(</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2008</LINK>). However, biomarkers interact via multiple complex pathways, and the overall effect of oestrogen on clinical outcomes cannot be predicted with any certainty. Therefore, trials with clinical endpoints such as myocardial infarction (MI) are necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Banks-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banks 2009a</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-05 19:51:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Observational studies have revealed a range of adverse effects of HT, including doubling or tripling of the risk of thromboembolic events, a large increase in endometrial cancer risk among women taking oestrogen without progestogen, an increased incidence of gallbladder disease and a possible link between HT and breast cancer. The suggestion that HT might increase the risk of breast cancer was supported by evidence of an increase in breast density in a high proportion of women taking oestrogen, but findings have been inconsistent and controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett-Connor 1998</LINK>). The results of a very large observational study conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Beral-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beral 2003</LINK>) raised concerns that current users of both combined and oestrogen-only HT were at increased risk of both incident and fatal breast cancer after relatively short periods of use. The increase in risk was greatest among users of combined HT, with no large variations reported between the effects of specific oestrogens or specific progestogens. Risks were greater if HT use started at around the time of menopause than if it started later. Breast cancer rates were highest among current users of combined HT who began use within 5 years of menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Beral-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beral 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death and morbidity in older women, and it was held that a significant reduction in CHD risk from HT would outweigh any potential adverse effects. However, these uncontrolled studies showed strong potential for selection or compliance bias, or both, with oestrogen-takers more likely to be healthy, well-educated, compliant women with a lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease. The need for randomised controlled trials has been recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett_x002d_Connor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett-Connor 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 2000a</LINK>). It has been suggested that wide prescribing of HT in the 1990s, despite the lack of randomised evidence of its efficacy and safety, might reflect a conflict between commercial and professional interest groups and good public policy (<LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 2000</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate the marked CHD benefits of HT seen in observational studies and have raised questions about its overall risk-benefit profile.</P>
<P>Other Cochrane reviews have found strong evidence that HT is effective in treating women with menopausal symptoms. One review reported a 75% reduction in the frequency of hot flushes among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women taking HT, relative to placebo, and a statistically significant reduction in symptom severity for the HT group (odds ratio (OR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23) (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2004</LINK>). Another review found that local oestrogens were more effective in relieving the symptoms of vaginal atrophy among postmenopausal women when compared with placebo or non-hormonal gel (<LINK REF="REF-Suckling-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suckling 2006</LINK>). However, women contemplating the use of HT for menopausal symptoms must be aware of negative findings in other areas, as discussed below.</P>

<P>In view of the large number of reviews on individual aspects of HT, review authors recognised the need for a systematic review that would provide an overview of all relevant long-term clinical outcomes, thereby providing assistance to women and their clinicians who must make informed judgements about the use of HT. An a priori decision was made to exclude studies of duration shorter than 1 year and not to include as outcomes menopausal symptom control, early-onset side effects of HT and surrogate measures such as endometrial hyperplasia and bone mineral density. This review is not intended to replace other Cochrane reviews on HT, including those listed above. These reviews remain an important source of evidence on individual aspects of HT and will continue to be updated regularly.</P>

<P>We combined data for meta-analysis by using RevMan software and the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method. We could reach no consensus about whether a fixed-effect or a random-effects model should be used for meta-analysis, so we performed both types of analysis.

<P>We planned to combine continuous data for meta-analysis, had any such data been available for pooling. Meta-analytical methods for continuous data assume that the underlying distribution of measurements is normal. The ratio of the mean to its standard deviation serves as a crude method of assessing skew if this ratio was less than 1.65 for any study group; unless original data were available for log transformation, we did not include the results in analysis tables but reported them in 'Other data' tables.

We justified judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low or very low) and documented and incorporated these judgments into reporting of results for each outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Search update 2017</HEADING>
<P>We screened 3046 records, discarded 3041 as clearly irrelevant and retained 45 articles, which we checked in full text. From these 44 articles, we identified two new studies: <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK> (15 articles) and <LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK> (5 articles). We also identified 20 articles that were additional publications related to studies already included (19 articles for <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> and one article for <LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK>) and five studies that we excluded (<LINK REF="STD-AHT-2015" TYPE="STUDY">AHT 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paoletti-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Paoletti 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasgon-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rasgon 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schierbeck-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Schierbeck 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2016" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this update of the review, we also excluded three studies that were included in previous versions of the review but that no longer meet our eligibility criteria because we have decided to report fewer outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Haines-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haines 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pefanco-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pefanco 2007</LINK>).

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2017-01-06 14:35:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 22 eligible studies are based on one very large study (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> incorporated randomised comparisons of two different HT regimens versus placebo and published these results separately. One study (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2002</LINK>) compared combined oestrogen and progesterone versus placebo and is referred to in this review as <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm); the other compared oestrogen-only HT versus placebo and is referred to in this review as <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT arm). <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> also included a subgroup study known as the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), which measured cognitive outcomes in older women (aged 65 to 79 years at study entry) from both arms of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> and is referred to in this review as <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) (<LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 1998</LINK>). An additional ancillary study - <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHISCA) - enrolled women from <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) who were free of dementia to investigate the effects of HT on domain-specific cognitive function in older women (<LINK REF="REF-Resnick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnick 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 22 identified studies included 43,637 randomised women: 22,693 randomised to some form of HT and 20,928 to placebo (treatment allocation was unclear for 16 women in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ferenczy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferenczy 2002</LINK>)). <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK> included 1307 additional women who were randomised to a comparison of two active hormone therapies but are not included in this review. Investigators analysed results for more than 99% of these women by intention to treat. Although some studies used biological measures as their primary outcome (e.g. lumen of carotid artery), we included them because they also reported clinical endpoints relevant to this review as prespecified secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>The studies varied dramatically in size. The largest was <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, which randomised 27,347 participants, and the other studies varied in sample size from 40 (<LINK REF="STD-Tierney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 2009</LINK>) to 5692 (<LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK>) participants. Investigators included 8000 women in each group in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm) and more than 5000 in each group in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT arm), along with more than 1400 in each group on the oestrogen-only HT arm of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) and more than 2200 in each group on the combined arm of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS). <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> included about 1380 women in each comparison group, <LINK REF="STD-ESPRIT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIT 2002</LINK> included more than 500 in each group, <LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK> included around 400 women in each group and <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK> included 220 to 275 per group. Otherwise, none of the studies included more than 210 women in each group. Five of the smaller studies were single-centred (<LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPAT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">EPAT 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 2009</LINK>), and it is unclear whether one study (<LINK REF="STD-EVTET-2000" TYPE="STUDY">EVTET 2000</LINK>) enlisted more than one trial centre. The other 10 studies involved between 7 and 40 trial centres.</P>
<P>Fourteen studies were conducted in the USA, and one in each of the following countries: UK, Estonia, Norway, Canada and Denmark; three studies were international in scope (one in the USA and Canada, one in Canada and the Netherlands and one in the UK, Australia and New Zealand). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK>) were originally planned as part of a larger international project, but planning was beset with delays, and in the meantime, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> began in the USA when other countries were no longer prepared to commit funds to a second study with similar objectives. Both of these studies were prematurely closed as a result of publication of early <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> findings.</P>
<P>We attempted to contact investigators for the following studies to request more information about their methods or outcomes: <LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPAT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">EPAT 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EVTET-2000" TYPE="STUDY">EVTET 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferenczy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferenczy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WAVE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WAVE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WEST-2001" TYPE="STUDY">WEST 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The women included in these studies were predominantly postmenopausal, spontaneously or surgically. The age of participants ranged from 26 to 91 years, with mean or median age of each study ranging from 48 to 76 years (no age was stated in <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>). In more than half of the studies, mean participant age was over 60 years. Inclusion criteria varied according to the primary objectives of individual studies. Some were designed to investigate the use of HT for treatment of women with menopausal symptoms or for disease prevention and thus enrolled women in reasonably good health. Others were designed to assess whether HT was beneficial for women with a history of cancer or established disease, including heart disease, thromboembolic disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease or long-term medical conditions requiring hospitalisation; these studies restricted entry to women who had received a diagnosis of the condition of interest.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies of women without established medical conditions</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies enrolled relatively healthy women (<LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPAT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">EPAT 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferenczy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferenczy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenspan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Greenspan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaffe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yaffe 2006</LINK>). Women in some of these studies had risk factors (such as raised cholesterol), and a small minority within individual studies had a history of cardiovascular disease, but most participants were fit women without overt disease. Most of these studies were interested in the use of HT for disease prevention.</P>
<P>Three studies were large and investigated the use of HT to prevent cardiovascular disease while also reporting a wide range of other endpoints; researchers provided highly detailed lists of inclusion and exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, enrolment was targeted to establish set fractions for baseline age categories and to achieve representation of racial and ethnic groups in the proportions recorded by the US census for individuals 50 to 79 years of age.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm) investigators noted that prevalence of prior cardiovascular disease in participants was low: 4.4% had a history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, stroke or transient ischaemic attack. They also commented that levels of cardiovascular risk factors were consistent with a generally healthy population of postmenopausal women: 2.9% reported a history of angina, 36% were hypertensive (or were being treated for hypertension), 13% were being treated for high cholesterol, 4.4% were being treated for diabetes and 10.5% were current smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 2003</LINK>). Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT arm), participants in general were considered healthy, although 4.1% had a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularisation, 5.8% had a history of angina, 1.4% had a history of stroke,1.6% had a history of venous thrombosis, 48% were hypertensive (or were being treated for hypertension), 15% were receiving treatment for high cholesterol, 7.7% were being treated for diabetes and 10.5% were current smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Stefanick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefanick 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK> compared the characteristics of their cohort with values returned in large US surveys and concluded that although the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK> cohort was generally in better health than the wider US population, these individuals were not so markedly different as to limit the generalisability of study results. Both <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK> were designed to test whether menopausal HT initiated soon after menopause could delay progression of atherosclerosis. Two other 'prevention' studies aimed to test the possible beneficial effects of HT on arterial wall density (<LINK REF="STD-EPAT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">EPAT 2001</LINK>) and bone density (<LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2002</LINK>). Four much smaller studies also enrolled women without stated health problems who were in early menopause (<LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>) or were postmenopausal and aimed to assess the effects of HT on endometrial safety (<LINK REF="STD-Ferenczy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferenczy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>) and other clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Greenspan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Greenspan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK> recruited women with no known major health problems from general practice registers in countries with free or low fee healthcare systems. Investigators designed recruitment to target older women first; as a result, median participant age was 63 years and few women in the younger age group were included when the study closed prematurely.<BR/>

The largest of these six studies (<LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>) compared its cohort of women with a similar group of women presumed to have coronary heart disease, who were participants in a survey designed to produce nationally representative data: The <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> cohort included significantly fewer smokers, women with hypertension and women with diabetes than the comparison group, but individuals were comparable with respect to blood pressure, body mass index, physical activity and cholesterol levels.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>) included women with Alzheimer's disease, and an older study (<LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1979</LINK>) included women with a range of medical conditions such as diabetes, need for custodial care, arteriosclerosis and chronic neurological disorders: All participants in this study were hospitalised for the duration of the 10-year study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The included studies used a wide variety of oestrogen-alone or oestrogen and progestogen combinations as interventions; some included more than one intervention arm, each with a different dose, formulation or route of HT. Most comparisons used a moderate dose of oestrogen (e.g. oestradiol 1 mg, conjugated equine oestrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg daily, transdermal oestradiol 0.05 mg twice weekly). <LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1979</LINK> used a much higher dose than the other included studies, reflecting the fact that it was conducted many years earlier than the others.</P>

<P>The outcomes measured by individual studies varied according to study objectives. Major clinical events were not primary outcomes for several of these studies but were measured as adverse effects, for example, cardiovascular events or the incidence of cancer and fracture in the study population, or both. Eight studies used biological measures as their primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPAT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">EPAT 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ERA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ERA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WAVE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WAVE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaffe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yaffe 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The largest study in the review (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>) was concerned mainly with the cardioprotective role of HT in relatively healthy women, and study authors reported cardiovascular clinical endpoints as the primary outcome. They designated invasive breast cancer as a primary adverse outcome and included the incidence of other cancers, fractures, gallbladder disease and death as secondary outcomes. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK>) measured similar outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> also conducted a number of analyses not specified in the study protocol. Lung cancer was not a prespecified outcome but was investigated in both arms of the study in post hoc analyses, which included additional follow-up periods after the planned completion date of the study.</P>
<P>After the intervention phase of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> had been completed, investigators followed up major clinical outcomes in surviving participants (i.e. those who consented), comprising 78% of participants in the oestrogen-only arm and 83% in the combined HT arm. Median cumulative follow-up (intervention phase plus extended follow-up) was 13.2 years in the oestrogen-only arm (including median postintervention follow-up of 6.6 years) and 13 years in the combined HT group (including median postintervention follow-up of 6.6 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) comprised a large subset of older women from <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> who were evaluated for probable dementia (the planned primary outcome) and for mild cognitive impairment (as a planned secondary outcome). Researchers also reported global cognitive function, although this was not a formally preplanned endpoint. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) reported separate results for the two study arms and also pooled study results, but we did not include the pooled results in this review (see <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>Two smaller studies reported endometrial cancer as a primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferenczy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ferenczy 2002</LINK>), and two (<LINK REF="STD-Obel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Obel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tierney 2009</LINK>) reported as primary outcomes clinical events that were not of interest for this review, but researchers measured outcomes of interest as adverse events.</P>
<P>Five other studies were concerned with the effect of HT on established clinical disease. Four reported cardiovascular outcomes: Primary outcomes were myocardial infarction or death (<LINK REF="STD-ESPRIT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>), thromboembolism (<LINK REF="STD-EVTET-2000" TYPE="STUDY">EVTET 2000</LINK>) and stroke (<LINK REF="STD-WEST-2001" TYPE="STUDY">WEST 2001</LINK>). The larger studies also measured a range of other major clinical events such as the incidence of cancer, fracture and gallbladder disease (<LINK REF="STD-ESPRIT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>). One study reported the effect of HT on global cognitive function (<LINK REF="STD-Greenspan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Greenspan 2005</LINK>) and one on progression of symptoms in women with Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>); another study measured a wide range of clinical outcomes over a treatment period of 10 years with HT in women who were receiving long-term hospital care for a range of medical conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1979</LINK>).</P>

One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK>) randomised women who expressed an interest in participating but did not open the randomisation envelope until their eligibility had been checked and they had consented.

<P>All studies described themselves as (at least) double-blinded. Eighteen studies explicitly stated that all participants, clinical staff and outcome assessors or research staff were blinded to treatment allocation, or they reported 'hard' outcomes unlikely to be influenced by blinding. In the WHI study, 331 women randomised to receive active treatment were unblinded and changed arms from <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT arm) to <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm) according to a change in protocol.

<P>For the purposes of this review, we defined losses to follow-up as participants for whom outcomes of interest were unknown (and who may or may not have had outcomes imputed in statistical analysis). We defined drop-outs as participants who stopped their allocated treatment (and in some cases changed to a different off-trial treatment) but had known clinical outcomes and were included in the analysis. Adherence to treatment refers to the number of tablets actually taken, which we often assessed by pill counts (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We defined intention to treat as analysis of all randomised participants in the groups to which they were randomised.</P>
<P>Drop-out rates were generally high, particularly in the active treatment groups, and they increased over time. In <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm), 42% of the active treatment group and 38% of the placebo group were no longer taking their allocated treatment at 5 years, and a further 10.7% of the placebo group had crossed to active therapy. In <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT arm), 53% of participants overall were no longer taking their allocated treatment at 6.8 years, and a further 5.7% had initiated hormone use outside the study.

However, different publications for this study (<LINK REF="STD-EPHT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EPHT 2006</LINK>) reported slightly different numbers of randomised participants.

<P>Within these categories, we have grouped interventions according to the oestrogen dose used, with equivalence between doses based on the Australian Menopause Society guide to equivalent HT doses (<LINK REF="REF-AMS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMS 2016</LINK>), which classifies HT as low dose (e.g. oral oestradiol 1 mg), medium dose (e.g. oral oestradiol 2 mg, transdermal oestradiol 50 µg, conjugated equine oestrogen 0.065 mg) or higher dose (e.g. transdermal oestradiol 75 µg).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>Although comparisons with similar oestrogen doses are grouped together, we pooled comparisons (meta-analysed) only if they used the same combination of oestrogen and progestogen for the same (or a similar) length of time. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK> used the same HT regimen and reported several of the same clinical outcomes at 3 years, but in most cases, <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK> reported no events in either arm. We combined three studies (<LINK REF="STD-ERA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ERA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WAVE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WAVE 2002</LINK>) for some 3-year (2.8 to 3.2) outcomes, but otherwise meta-analysis was inappropriate for most outcomes because the studies used different types or doses of oestrogen or progestogen, or both, and these do not necessarily have the same metabolic effects; or they used different durations of HT, which might have led to different effects as the result of trends over time.</P>
<P>Very few results were suitable for pooling; therefore, statistical heterogeneity was not a major issue in this review. One meta-analysis displayed statistically significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66.2%), but it involved only two small studies with few events, and we attributed the heterogeneity to chance (<LINK REF="CMP-002.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.21</LINK>).</P>

Although a significant trend in both arms of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> and in the blinded phase of <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> showed diminution of cardiovascular risk in the HT group over time, subsequent analysis of <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> data, which included both blinded and unblinded follow-up, revealed no statistically significant variation in risk over time. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> investigators suggest that the apparent decline in cardiovascular risk in later years may be due to an acceleration of events during earlier years among susceptible women in the HT group, and they point out that with longer duration of treatment, the risk of breast cancer is increased.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm) conducted prespecified subgroup analyses to evaluate whether any clinical characteristics of the study population might plausibly modulate the coronary effects of HT: Variables included age, time since menopause, presence or absence of vasomotor symptoms, prior hormone use, coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor status and presence or absence of preexisting cardiovascular disease. However, none of these variables significantly affected results.</P>
<P>Among women taking combined HT in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, those who had factor V Leiden mutation (a blood coagulation disorder) were at higher risk of venous thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-Cushman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushman 2004</LINK>). Statistical power was insufficient to allow investigators to determine whether significant excess risk was associated with a history of venous thromboembolism (among women taking combined HT). The incidence of thromboembolism was higher among older and obese women, although this was related to their higher baseline risk of an event, and their risk ratio did not differ from that of other women taking combined HT.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that vascular effects of HT may differ according to a woman's age or time since onset of menopause. Thus oestrogen may counteract the early stages of atherosclerosis in recently menopausal women by inhibiting lipid deposits within the endothelium. However, HT may have adverse effects on more advanced disease, by facilitating an increase in enzymes that tend to disrupt atherosclerotic lesions, and by encouraging clot formation (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 2013;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Reslan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reslan 2012</LINK>). Research findings on the effect of HT in early menopause on intermediate outcomes of CVD are variable (<LINK REF="STD-ELITE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ELITE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-KEEPS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">KEEPS 2012</LINK>), and research findings on this topic are continuing (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 2015</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Breast cancer</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm), breast cancer rates in the HT group were initially lower than in the placebo group, and when <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WISDOM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">WISDOM 2007</LINK> data were combined, at 1 year's follow-up, the difference reached statistical significance, favouring the intervention group. However, by the fourth year of use, more events occurred in the HT group, and a statistically significant trend showed increasing risk over time. At a mean of 11 years' follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, women in the combined HT group had a significantly higher rate of invasive breast cancer than controls, and longer follow-up (to a median of 13.2 years) showed no evidence of attenuation of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2015a</LINK>). At 11 years, the trend toward a higher rate of death from breast cancer approached statistical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2010</LINK>). This long-term increase in risk was apparent despite evidence that the risk of breast cancer associated with combined HT declined markedly over the first 2 years after discontinuation of hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> investigators commented that breast cancers in the combined HT group were diagnosed at a similar grade but at a more advanced stage and suggested that combined HT may stimulate breast cancer growth while delaying diagnosis. Evidence shows that combined HT increases the frequency of abnormal mammograms and indications for breast biopsy but compromises the diagnostic performance of both of these tests (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2008)</LINK>. These factors would account for the lower incidence of breast cancer among women taking combined therapy during the first 2 years in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998.</LINK> Subgroup analyses of prior hormone use in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> revealed that the cumulative incidence of breast cancer over time in women taking combined HT increased at a greater rate than in women taking placebo after about 3 years for prior hormone users and after about 5 years for women with no prior use. Interference with mammography precluded the possibility of defining with any reliability a time frame for the safe use of combined HT (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> reported a <I>decrease</I> in the risk of breast cancer in the unopposed oestrogen arm of the trial, which reached statistical significance when investigators took into account the entire 10.7 years of intervention and extended follow-up. Cumulative event rates still differed significantly between groups over 13 years' follow-up, and risk of death from breast cancer was lower in the HT group at nearly 12 years. Comparison of hazard ratios during early and late postintervention periods showed that lower risk of breast cancer in the oestrogen arm persisted for about 4.5 years after the intervention was provided, at which point a significant difference between the interventions was no longer evident (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2015a;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2015b</LINK>). Subgroup analyses showed significantly fewer early cancers and significantly fewer ductal carcinomas in the intervention group, although the incidence of lobular tumours did not differ significantly. Results showed that the reduction in breast cancer risk was concentrated in women without benign breast disease (P = 0.01) or a first-degree family history of breast cancer (P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2012</LINK>). Oestrogen-only HT appears to increase the number of women needing repeat mammography or breast biopsy but (in contrast to combined HT) does not appear to substantially compromise breast cancer detection (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> researchers stated that differences between participants across the two arms of the study did not explain differences in breast cancer incidence and suggested that increased risk in the combined group might be due to progestogen. Similar trends in other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Beral-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beral 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>) support this theory. A nested case-control study comparing pair-matched controls of women who developed breast cancer in either arm of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2014</LINK>) suggested that post-treatment changes in serum oestrogens and concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin, or changes in the association of such concentrations with disease risk, might explain both the increased breast cancer risk noted with combined HT and the reduction in risk seen with unopposed oestrogen. It has been observed that exposure to oestrogen after a sustained period of oestrogen deprivation reduces the risk of breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Obiorah-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obiorah 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Colorectal cancer</HEADING>
<P>The significantly reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in women taking combined continuous HT in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> was offset by the finding that colorectal cancers diagnosed in such women tended to be more advanced, with greater likelihood of lymphatic or metastatic involvement. Moreover, the reduced incidence in the HT group did not lead to a reduced death rate from colorectal cancer over extended follow-up (7.1 years), although investigators noted that an even longer period of follow-up might be required to observe a mortality benefit from a reduction in the incidence of small, localised cancers. Women taking oestrogen-only HT in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> did not have a reduced incidence of or death rate from colorectal cancer over 7 years' follow-up nor during extended follow-up to 10.7 years. Overall, no strong evidence suggests a clinically meaningful reduction in colorectal cancer rates with oestrogen-alone or oestrogen plus progestin.

<P>Post hoc analysis of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> data revealed that combined HT did not significantly increase the incidence of lung cancer over 8 years' follow-up but did increase mortality from lung cancer, independent of smoking status. Study authors (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2009</LINK>) suggested that this might be so because combined HT stimulates the growth of preexisting small cell lung cancers.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gynaecological cancers</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies showed an increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer in the group taking HT. Three studies randomised women with a uterus to oestrogen-only HT (<LINK REF="STD-EPAT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">EPAT 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ESPRIT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ESPRIT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK>). As endometrial cancer is well documented as an adverse effect of unopposed oestrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Kurman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurman 1985</LINK>), these women were closely monitored for atypical endometrial hyperplasia and received treatment (and discontinuation of study medications) if it was detected. <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1995" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1995</LINK> reported that women in the oestrogen-only HT group were significantly more likely to develop atypical endometrial hyperplasia than women in the placebo group, whereas women in the combined HT groups in the same study showed no increased risk of hyperplasia. After more than 13 years' extended follow-up, rates of endometrial cancer were lower in the combined HT group in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>The study of oestrogen-only therapy in women who had undergone surgery for stage I or II endometrial cancer was underpowered owing to early discontinuation and could not conclusively refute or support the safety of this therapy with regard to risk of recurrence. Study authors note that recurrence rates were low, at 1.9% in the placebo group and 2.3% in the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Barakat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barakat 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results showed a trend towards increased risk of ovarian cancer in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm), which did not reach statistical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>). As noted above, a systematic review of (mainly) observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Greiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greiser 2006</LINK>) suggests that both oestrogen-only and combined therapy may be associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.</P>
<P>A randomised study with 4-year follow-up of 130 women with a history of ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Guidozzi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guidozzi 1999</LINK>) found that oestrogen-only hormone therapy did not negatively affect disease-free or overall survival time compared with no hormone therapy. A similar randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-AHT-2015" TYPE="STUDY">AHT 2015</LINK>) showed that women with severe menopausal symptoms after ovarian cancer who took HT (of varying types, according to consultant preference) had improved overall and relapse-free survival compared with controls not taking HT. The present systematic review did not include these studies because they lacked a placebo control group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fractures</HEADING>
<P>Evidence on HT and fractures is not consistent. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> found a significantly reduced risk of fractures in women taking combined continuous HT or oestrogen-only HT over nearly 8 years' follow-up, but <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> reported no benefit for women on continuous combined HT. Moreover, unblinded continuation of <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> revealed a significantly <I>increased </I>risk of hip fracture among such women. Study authors attributed this finding to chance, noting that the effect was considerably smaller in the as-treated analysis, and that such a finding lacks biological plausibility (<LINK REF="REF-Hulley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulley 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm) investigators tested the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of HT on fracture incidence differed according to fracture risk factors. They found that the reduction in risk provided by HT was no greater in women at high risk of fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2003</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> excluded women with severe osteoporosis and did not routinely collect bone mineral density; thus the benefits of HT may outweigh the risks for some women with severe osteoporosis. Reduced risk of hip fracture associated with HT did not persist in the extended follow-up phase of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT).</P>
<P>Our analyses of hip fracture may have had insufficient power to reach conclusive findings. The risk of hip fracture rises steeply from the age of about 60 years but is still under 0.5% among women in the UK 65 to 69 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Banks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banks 2009</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Most women who need treatment for low bone mineral density require lifelong therapy, but the highest risk of cardiovascular events with combined HT occurs during the first year of use. Overall, although HT is considered effective for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk, for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cognitive outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) found that neither combined HT nor oestrogen-only HT improved global cognitive function in women over 65 years of age. Improvement in global cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) scores) that occurred in all participant groups over the first few years of WHIMS was attributed to a learning effect resulting from repeated administration of cognitive tests (<LINK REF="REF-Espeland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espeland 2004</LINK>). The difference in mean scores between active therapy and placebo groups was of borderline statistical significance and consistently favoured placebo groups, although the difference was too small to be clinically meaningful. However, a marked decrease in 3MSE scores (defined as &gt; 2 standard deviations from the baseline mean) was more frequent in the active treatment groups, and this trend reached statistical significance in the combined HT group. Moreover, in both arms, HT had greater detrimental effects in women whose baseline 3MSE scores were lowest (<LINK REF="REF-Espeland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espeland 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, for the outcome of probable dementia, a negative trend in both active treatment groups reached statistical significance in the combined HT group. Evidence of increased risk in this group began to appear as early as 1 year after randomisation and persisted over 5 years' follow-up. The overall risk of dementia in women taking combined HT was twice that in women in the corresponding placebo group. Investigators noted that the absolute risk of dementia remained relatively small, at 45 per 10,000 postmenopausal women over 65 years of age who took combined HT for 1 year (<LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>These findings were unexpected and contrast sharply with findings reported in earlier research. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHIMS) investigators suggested that this might be due to the healthy user bias seen in observational studies (whereby HT users had a better prognosis at baseline than the control groups), to the differential effects of HT on specific domains of cognition not measured individually by 3MSE, or both. Alternatively, they suggested that HT might need to be initiated during a critical period, such as menopause, to protect cognitive function at a later age. The mean age of the WHIMS population was 71 years, and the study could not address this theory, although previous users of HT in WHIMS did not have higher scores (<LINK REF="REF-Espeland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espeland 2004</LINK>). Moreover, results of extended follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (WHISCA) show no evidence of any benefit in domain-specific cognitive function from oestrogen-alone or combined HT.</P>
<P>A post hoc comparison of global cognitive function among younger women in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Espeland-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espeland 2013;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Vaughan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughan 2013</LINK>) included women randomised to either active arm of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (CEE or combined HT) versus women in the placebo arm. Scores were similar in the two groups (P = 0.66). The study included 1376 women 50 to 55 years of age when randomised for <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>. Cognitive testing was conducted an average of 7.2 years following trial completion, when women had a mean age of 67.2 years, and was repeated 1 year later. Study investigators concluded that "CEE-based therapies produced no overall sustained benefit or risk to cognitive function when administered to postmenopausal women aged 50&#8211;55 years". However, among 2880 women who had enrolled for <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> at the age of 65 to 79 years, long-term decrements in global cognitive function were noted in the HT groups (CEE or combined HT) relative to the placebo group, which consisted of older women (P &lt; 0.05). Effects were small, and decrements were fairly stable.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type of HT</HEADING>
<P>Nearly all statistically significant findings described in this review derived from the two biggest studies - <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>. Both studies evaluated oral conjugated equine oestrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg, with or without continuous methoxyprogesterone (MPA 2.5 mg). Smaller studies using other types of HT reported very few or no major clinical events. We were generally unable to combine results from individual studies because they used different types of HT, which may not be equivalent in effect, or they differed with respect to the study population, or both. Controversy surrounds the degree to which the findings of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> apply to any type of HT other than continuous combined oral CEE 0.625 mg with or without MPA 2.5 mg. Effects may vary with different oestrogens and progestogens, different time frames for the use of HRT and different doses and routes of administration (e.g. unopposed oestrogen and intrauterine progestogen). Observational evidence shows that transdermal oestrogen differs from oral oestrogen in that it is not associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism and suggests that some types of progestogen are thrombogenic but others are safe in this respect (<LINK REF="REF-Canonico-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canonico 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Population characteristics</HEADING>
<P>It is important to consider any increased risk to health in absolute rather than relative terms. This review is inevitably dominated by the findings of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, which was designed to evaluate the efficacy of HT in preventing major causes of morbidity and mortality among older women (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1997</LINK>). It was not designed to evaluate the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for treatment of menopausal symptoms, and it specifically excluded women who reported menopausal symptoms severe enough to preclude assignment to placebo treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>). Moreover, <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> did not include women younger than 50 years of age, and study findings may not apply to young surgically menopausal women, for example, a woman who has had both ovaries removed while in her forties (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence is lacking on the long-term effects of HT on healthy younger women, who are most likely to use it for menopausal symptoms. Such women are likely to be in their early fifties, when the absolute risk of a life-threatening event is low; it has been estimated that absolute risk for many diseases approximately doubles with each decade of age (<LINK REF="REF-Hulley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulley 2004</LINK>). Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm)<I> revealed</I> that for relatively healthy women taking combined continuous HT, the only increase in risk that reached statistical significance was risk of venous thrombosis. Risk in the HT group increased from eight venous thromboses per 10,000 women per year to 19 per 10,000 women per year. This increase in risk was highest during the first year of therapy but continued over 5 years of treatment, and it was particularly high in obese women (i.e. women with a body mass index greater than 30), who had a 5-year risk of 1.4% compared with 0.5% among women of normal weight. In the oestrogen-only arm of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, over the full 10.7 years of intervention and extended follow-up, younger women (aged 50 to 59 years) randomised to HT had significantly more favourable outcomes than those randomised to placebo. The HT group had significantly lower hazard ratios for coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and death when compared with the placebo group. Findings were similar for both coronary outcomes when data were stratified by time since menopause rather than by age. This contrasted with findings in older women, among whom those in the HT group showed a trend for higher rates of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and death, and significantly higher rates of colorectal cancer and chronic disease. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> authors noted that study participants took unopposed oestrogen for a median duration of less than 6 years, and that study results cannot be extrapolated to longer or shorter treatment durations. Moreover, it is important to note that oestrogen-only HT is contraindicated for women with an intact uterus, as use from 1 to 5 years has been estimated to increase the risk of endometrial cancer threefold (from a baseline lifetime risk of about 3% for a woman of 50), with effects persisting for several years after oestrogen is stopped (<LINK REF="REF-Grady-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grady 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that effects of HT may differ according to whether it is initiated soon after menopause or after a lengthy gap (<LINK REF="REF-Barret_x002d_Connor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barret-Connor 2007</LINK>). Analysis of randomised (<LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2009a</LINK>) and observational (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>) data revealed that for most clinical outcomes, effects of HT did not vary by HT timing; this applied to both oestrogen-only and combined HT. One exception was breast cancer, for which risk was higher among women who initiated HT soon after menopause than in those who had a longer time gap. Their overall risk of cancer was also higher.</P>
<P>HT appears to carry increased risk of recurrence for women with a history of breast cancer. Two unblinded studies conducted in Sweden randomised breast cancer survivors with menopausal symptoms to HT or non-hormonal treatment. Both studies were terminated early owing to a statistically significant increase in the incidence of recurrent breast cancer in the hormonal group in one of the studies (risk ratio (RR) 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 8.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebowski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebowski 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2004</LINK>). After a median of 4 years' follow-up in this study, a clinically and statistically significantly increased risk of a new breast cancer event continued in the HT arm (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.2) (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2008</LINK>). A similar study initiated in the UK terminated recruitment prematurely in January 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-ICR-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICR 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cardiovascular outcomes, results of <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK> largely support the results of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm), suggesting that these findings can be generalised to older women taking combined continuous HT, whether or not they have known cardiovascular risk factors (although their findings differ with respect to fracture risk).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health benefits and risks after stopping HT</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (combined HT arm) reported health outcomes at a mean of 2.4 years&#8217; extended follow-up after the planned intervention period (<LINK REF="REF-Heiss-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heiss 2008</LINK>). Follow-up data for this period were available for 95% of women, few of whom were using HT during extended follow-up (4.3% in the intervention arm and 1.2% in the placebo arm at 1 year after the study was stopped). Over the course of follow-up, risk of coronary events, stroke and venous thromboembolism decreased in the group that had been randomised to combined HT, and reached a level comparable with that of the placebo group. Similarly, results showed no significant differences between groups in risk of fractures or of colorectal cancer by the end of postintervention follow-up. However, in the group that had been randomised to combined HT, the hazard ratio (HR) for the outcome &#8220;all cancer&#8221; increased from 1.03 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.15) during the intervention phase to 1.24 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.48) in the postintervention period. This increase in risk was attributable in part to the disappearance of previous apparent protection from colorectal cancer, with some continued excess risk of breast cancer, along with added risk of lung cancer in the HT group. Study authors noted that clinical vigilance appears to be warranted with regard to sustained higher risk of malignancy following termination of combined HT therapy.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only arm) reported health outcomes at a mean of 3.9 years' extended follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-LaCroix-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaCroix 2011</LINK>). Follow-up data for this period were available for 78% of women, of whom only a small minority were using hormone therapy (up to 4.7% in the intervention arm and 3% in the placebo arm). Over the course of extended follow-up, results continued to show no significant difference between groups in rates of coronary events. Increases in risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism in the HT arm rapidly disappeared, as did reduced risk of hip fracture in this group. As noted above, the lower incidence of breast cancer persisted and became statistically significant with extended follow-up to 10.7 years (i.e. including both planned intervention and extended follow-up periods).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-05 18:49:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the included studies were at low risk of bias in most domains (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We rated the overall quality of evidence as moderate, and the main limitation involved questions about applicability of the evidence because most of the data were provided by <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>, in which only about 33% of the study sample was 50 to 59 years of age at baseline (i.e. the age at which women are most likely to consider HT for vasomotor symptoms); mean participant age was 63 years.</P>
<P>A high proportion of women in these studies did not receive the treatment to which they were randomised. In general, the number of women who discontinued their medication or who took less than 80% of their medication was disproportionately high in the HT groups, presumably because of a higher incidence of adverse effects such as vaginal bleeding. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> noted that if discontinuation of treatment and initiation of non-study treatment occurred independently of risk factors for clinical outcomes, their intention-to-treat analysis underestimates both harms and benefits of HT among women who adhere to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2002</LINK>). This study included a disproportionate number of women who were unblinded in the HT group compared with the placebo group (40% vs 6%), primarily to manage persistent vaginal bleeding, and it has been suggested that this differential unblinding may have resulted in higher detection rates of otherwise undetectable myocardial infarction in the HT group (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 2003</LINK>). However, it has been suggested that detection bias on a scale that would explain the differences between groups for coronary heart disease could not have occurred, and that any bias was more likely to have occurred in the opposite direction, mitigating against detection of effects (<LINK REF="REF-Tucker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucker 2003</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-01-05 19:55:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is subject to patient selection bias. Most of the included studies had a mean participant age over 60 years, and none focused on perimenopausal women. In all but one of the 20 studies that reported mean participant age, mean age at enrolment was over 50 years. This does not reflect usual clinical practice with respect to prescribing of HT, which is most likely to occur for treatment of vasomotor symptoms at the time women reach menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 2003</LINK>). Moreover, participants described as 'relatively healthy' in this review were derived largely from <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>. Investigators reported a high frequency of obesity and hypertensive disorders among <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> participants; only 30% were of normal weight, and 30% were morbidly obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>); 36% were receiving treatment for hypertension or had blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg at enrolment.</P>
<P>Despite extensive searching, we may have failed to identify all relevant studies. However, it is unlikely that we missed any study large enough to substantially influence our overall findings, given dominance of the review by <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>. Similarly, although our data could conceivably have been organised in a different way (e.g. for categorising of study populations and HT doses), again the dominance of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> makes it extremely unlikely that this would have influenced our findings. We chose not to pool studies that used different types of HT, and this approach is supported by contrasting findings in the two arms (combined vs oestrogen-only HT) of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> for some outcomes.</P>
<P>The choice of 1 year's duration of HT as a cut-off point for inclusion of studies was arbitrary but is unlikely to have introduced bias, as it was a prespecified criterion.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-05 20:00:42 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings are consistent with those of a Cochrane review of HT for preventing cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Boardman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boardman 2015</LINK>), which concluded that use of HT in postmenopausal women has little if any benefit for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and causes an increase in the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolic events. <LINK REF="REF-Boardman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boardman 2015</LINK> differed from the current review in that review authors pooled data related to unopposed oestrogen with data for combined HT.</P>
<P>However, our findings differ from those of some older systematic reviews.</P>
<P>A systematic review of available randomised evidence was conducted in 1997 and was updated with unpublished evidence in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 2000</LINK>). Review authors reported a conservatively estimated odds ratio for cardiovascular events of 1.34 (95% CI 0.55 to 3.30) among those taking HT. However, this result was based on only 15 secondary events in those allocated to HT and seven among the control groups and provided insufficient evidence to exclude potential benefit from HT.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Beral-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beral 2002</LINK> pooled the results of four randomised controlled trials of HT published between 1998 and 2002 (<LINK REF="STD-EVTET-2000" TYPE="STUDY">EVTET 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HERS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WEST-2001" TYPE="STUDY">WEST 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK>). They reported no significant excess or reduction in the risk ratio of CHD, and their findings negated the large beneficial effect of HT reported for cardiovascular outcomes in earlier observational studies. Moreover, they described excess risk of stroke, pulmonary embolus and breast cancer. Review authors found that risk of colorectal cancer or fractured neck of femur was significantly reduced for the HT group, and the findings for endometrial cancer risk were inconclusive. The authors of this review pooled the results of studies that used different types of HT over variable time frames. The most notable difference between the current review and <LINK REF="REF-Beral-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beral 2002</LINK> is that the current review found a statistically significant increase in risk of coronary heart disease among women taking combined continuous HT, particularly in the first year. Unlike the current review, <LINK REF="REF-Beral-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beral 2002</LINK> pooled results from studies of differing participant groups and types of HT; this appears to explain why overall findings differ.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2004</LINK> meta-analysed 17 RCTs of HT that reported at least 1 death and concluded that risk of death was significantly reduced in women with a mean age under 60 years who were taking HT compared with those taking a placebo, although results showed no difference when older women were compared. This meta-analysis pooled studies that differed widely with respect to the type of HT used and the clinical status of participants; in several studies, death was not a prespecified outcome. Moreover, women with poor prognosis for ovarian cancer accounted for 60% of events in the meta-analysis of studies of younger women. In the current review, evidence shows no survival advantage for women taking HT, although only one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> (oestrogen-only HT)) analysed younger women as a subgroup for this outcome. Of the 17 studies that Salpeter et al included in their meta-analysis of younger women, only two met the inclusion criteria for the present review; the other 15 studies included in the earlier review were not blinded, did not report mortality as a primary or secondary outcome or were of less than 1 year's duration.</P>
<P>A systematic review of studies of hormone therapy and ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Greiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greiser 2006</LINK>) included 30 case-control studies, seven cohort studies, one randomised controlled study and four cancer registry studies. This review found increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with the use of oestrogen-only HT (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.40) or combined hormone therapy (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21). This risk applied to a range of common histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. Review authors noted that this review was limited by reliance on observational data; however, heterogeneity was low or moderate in most analyses.</P>
<P>Another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2005</LINK>) meta-analysed 28 RCTs of HT that reported stroke events. HT was associated with a statistically significant excess risk of stroke, particularly ischaemic stroke. Moreover, participants in the HT group who had a stroke seemed to have a worse outcome. This review had very broad inclusion criteria and pooled a wide range of studies, which used different types of HT for a range of indications, some with male participants and some without placebo control. It is unclear to what extent these findings apply to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>A Danish study (<LINK REF="STD-Schierbeck-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Schierbeck 2012</LINK>) of 1006 recently postmenopausal or perimenopausal women (aged 45 to 58 years) was not eligible for this review owing to lack of blinding. Investigators reported that after 10 years of treatment, women taking triphasic 17-B oestradiol with norethisterone acetate or (in those who had had a hysterectomy) oestradiol alone were at lower risk of experiencing their primary outcome - a composite of death and admission to hospital for heart failure or myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87; P = 0.015). No increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism or stroke was apparent. Study authors attributed the difference between their findings and those of <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> to the younger age and proximity to menopause of their participants. This study was limited by lack of blinding and by the use of a composite primary outcome that was not prespecified in the study protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schroll-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroll 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 2003</LINK>). It has been noted that the cardiovascular outcomes were not ascertained by researchers but were based on data from individual clinicians entered into a national database (<LINK REF="REF-Abelin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abelin 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no randomised studies or systematic reviews that provided evidence about the risks of long-term HT in perimenopausal women or those younger than 50 years of age.</P>
<P>Current recommendations favour the use of low-dose HT for relief of vasomotor symptoms among women within 10 years of their last period, taken for the shortest possible time required to achieve treatment goals, with doses individually tailored and reviewed regularly (<LINK REF="REF-NAMS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAMS 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2012</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">HT for women with menopausal symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Women with intolerable menopausal symptoms may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose HT, provided they do not have specific contraindications. HT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (e.g. obesity, history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (e.g. breast cancer in women with a uterus). The risk of endometrial cancer among women with a uterus taking oestrogen-only HT is well documented.</P>
<P>Although none of the studies included in this review focused specifically on women in the age group most likely to require menopausal symptom relief, subgroup analyses in <LINK REF="STD-WHI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 1998</LINK> suggested that among relatively healthy women in their 50s taking oestrogen-only or combined HT, the only significant risk was increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in those taking combined HT. Absolute risk of venous thromboembolism was low, at 0.5% overall for a woman taking HT for 5 years. For women in their 50s without a uterus, taking oestrogen-only HT for 5 to 6 years appears relatively safe and may even confer some health benefits. However, safety over longer-term use is unknown.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">HT for other indications</HEADING>
<P>HT is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for preventing deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>Although HT is considered effective for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk, for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. Strong evidence suggests that both oestrogen-only HT and combined therapy significantly increase the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease, and that long-term use of combined continuous therapy also increases the risk of coronary events, breast cancer, death from lung cancer and (in women over 65 years of age) dementia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">HT for women with previous disease or smoking history</HEADING>
<P>HT is not recommended for use in women with cardiovascular disease or with a history of venous thrombosis or breast cancer. Randomised evidence provides no specific contraindications for its use in women with a history of endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer, although data are scanty. Women at high risk of lung cancer (current smokers or long-term past smokers) should be aware that combined HT increases the risk of death from lung cancer.</P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-05 13:30:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No studies have adequately assessed the safety of HT used for symptom relief by perimenopausal women, women younger than 50 years or women with temporary or permanent iatrogenic ovarian failure. Not enough is known about factors that may modulate the risks involved, such as clinical characteristics or biomarkers affecting individual women, different oestrogens and progestogens, different time frames for the use of HT and different doses and routes of administration (e.g. unopposed oestrogen and intrauterine progestogen, whether the risk of thromboembolism is diminished by the use of patches). Reliable evidence is needed to show the efficacy and safety of alternatives to HT for control of menopausal symptoms among women who may wish to avoid using HT, or for whom its use is unsuitable.</P>
