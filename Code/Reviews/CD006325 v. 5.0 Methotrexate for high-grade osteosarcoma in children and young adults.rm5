<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-23 14:53:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As a result of the introduction of chemotherapy, the survival of children with osteosarcoma has improved dramatically. The majority of the currently used treatment protocols are based on a combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate (MTX) and/or ifosfamide, of which MTX seems to be one of the most active drugs. However, in the literature, this has not been unambiguously proven. A well-informed decision on the use of MTX in the treatment of children and young adults diagnosed with primary high-grade osteosarcoma should be based on high quality evidence on both antitumour effects and adverse effects.</P>
<P>This systematic review focused on (randomised) controlled studies. The authors found that there were no studies in which the only difference between the intervention and control group was the use of MTX. They did identify a RCT comparing MTX with cisplatin. The risk of bias in this study was difficult to assess due to a lack of reporting. Survival could not be evaluated, but no evidence of a significant difference in response rate between the treatment groups was identified. However, a significant difference in the occurrence of toxicities in favour of treatment with MTX was identified, but treatment with cisplatin seemed to give better results with regard to quality of life. It should be noted that this study was performed in a different treatment era. Nowadays single agent treatment of osteosarcoma is considered inadequate. For other combinations of treatment including and not including MTX no studies are available. More high quality research is needed. At the moment, the authors are awaiting more details on 5 studies for which the currently available data were insufficient to assess eligibility for inclusion in this review.</P>

<P>Since no RCTs or CCTs in which only the use of MTX differed between the treatment groups were identified, no definitive conclusions can be made about the effects on antitumour efficacy, toxicities and quality of life of the addition of MTX to treatment of children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. The same is true for combinations of treatment including and not including MTX other than treatment with MTX versus treatment with cisplatin. Only 1 RCT comparing MTX with cisplatin treatment was available and therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of these agents in children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. Furthermore, this study was performed in a different treatment era. Nowadays single agent treatment of osteosarcoma is considered inadequate. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for the use of MTX in clinical practice. More high quality research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-24 11:32:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-24 11:32:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumour. It is the 6th most common group of malignant neoplasms in children and the 3rd most common in adolescents and young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Gurney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurney 1999</LINK>). In the past 3 decades the prognosis for children with osteosarcoma has improved dramatically due to the introduction of chemotherapy in the late 1960s. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed the favourable impact of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma (<LINK REF="STD-Link-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Link 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eilber-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Eilber 1987</LINK>). Prior to the chemotherapy era, osteosarcoma was treated by amputation alone and approximately 20% of patients survived (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1980</LINK>). Nowadays, 50-60% of the patients survive (<LINK REF="STD-Souhami-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Souhami 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of current treatment protocols is based on a combination of 2 or more of only 4 drugs: doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate (MTX) and ifosfamide, although the absolute role of each component of multidrug chemotherapy has still not been established. Also, it is difficult to say which drug regimen is superior.</P>
<P>MTX seems to be one of the most active drugs, however, at the moment, it is not clear if it is an essential part of a multidrug combination (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grem-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grem 1988</LINK>). In the literature, results are not unambiguously. Bramwell et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bramwell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bramwell 1992</LINK>) conducted a RCT comparing 2 chemotherapy schemes: doxorubicin and cisplatin versus high dose MTX (HDMTX) with reduced dose doxorubicin and cisplatin. Disease-free survival was inferior in patients who received the 3 drug arm but overall survival was not significantly different between both treatment arms. However, the intensity of administration of MTX was compromised by the design of the study. It appeared that the addition of MTX, whilst reducing platinum-related toxicity, did not compensate for a reduction in efficacy due to reduced dose and dose intensity of doxorubicin and cisplatin. The results showed that 4 doses of HDMTX could not compensate for a reduced dose and intensity of doxorubicin and cisplatin. A randomized study conducted by the Children's Cancer Study Group comparing HDMTX and intermediate dose MTX in combination with doxorubicin and vincristine as adjuvant therapy did not show any benefit of HDMXT (<LINK REF="REF-Krailo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krailo 1987</LINK>). Bacci et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bacci-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacci 1990b</LINK>) demonstrated that patients receiving HDMTX had higher overall survival rates at 5 years. For patients receiving HDMTX therapy a rate of 58% was reached versus 42% for patients treated with intermediate dose MTX. Bacci et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bacci-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacci 1998</LINK>) reported also that the complete remission rate at surgery was related to MTX levels. If serum levels were below 700 micromole/liter complete remission rates were 9.9% versus 28% in case higher levels were reached. Other authors also felt that dose intensity of MTX seemed to be critical (<LINK REF="REF-Delepine-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delepine 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delepine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delepine 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 1994</LINK>). The European Osteosarcoma Intergroup (EOI) has performed a randomized multicentre trial to compare a 2-drug regimen (doxorubicin, cisplatin) with a multi-drug regimen (HDMTX, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, vincristine, cisplatin) very similar with the T10 Rosen scheme (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1982a</LINK>) and no difference in survival between the 2 arms was seen (<LINK REF="STD-Souhami-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Souhami 1997</LINK>). The frequency of MTX dosing was decreased to allow the administration of doxorubicin when compared with the multi-drug scheme similar to the T10 Rosen scheme and with the presence of other active drugs the contribution of HDMTX was difficult to demonstrate. The authors emphasise that these findings should not be interpreted as HDMTX has no role in the management of osteosarcoma. Rosen and Nirenberg (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1982b</LINK>) have demonstrated that for maximum efficacy HDMTX should be administered weekly and hydration must not be excessive. In a randomized comparison between intra-arterial cisplatin and intravenous or intra-arterial HDMTX administered preoperatively, response rates were 60% for cisplatin and 27% for HDMTX, suggesting only moderate activity of HDMTX as a single agent (<LINK REF="STD-Jaffe-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffe 1985</LINK>). It should be noted that most of the studies mentioned here included not only children and young adults, but also patients older than 21 years.</P>
<P>Refinements in osteosarcoma therapy are necessary. Morbidity related to therapy is still considerable. Toxicity and expense of current chemotherapy regimens are substantial and late effects of such therapy have not been assessed completely. MTX seems to be the drug which has the most activity but it is not known if it is essential for the improvement of survival of children and young adults treated for osteosarcoma. This is an update of the first systematic review evaluating the state of evidence on the use of MTX in the treatment of high-grade osteosarcoma in children and young adults.</P>

<P>Information about trials not registered in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, or EMBASE, either published or unpublished, was located by searching the reference lists of included articles and review articles.

<P>
<B>Study identification</B>
<BR/>After employing the search strategy described previously, identification of studies meeting the inclusion criteria was undertaken by two reviewers independently. Any study seemingly meeting the inclusion criteria on grounds of the title, or abstract, or both, was obtained in full for closer inspection. Details of reasons for exclusion of any study considered for review were clearly stated. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus; no third party arbitration was needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Risk of bias in included studies</B>
<BR/>Selection bias was based on concealment of allocation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?), performance bias was based on blinding of the care provider (i.e. was the care provider blinded to treatment?) and blinding of participants (i.e. were the participants blinded to treatment?), detection bias was based on blinding of the outcome assessor (i.e. was the outcome assessor blinded to treatment?) and attrition bias was based on the use of an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (i.e. were all participants analysed in the treatment group to which they were randomised, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention?) and completeness of follow-up (i.e. were no participants excluded or lost-to-follow-up?). For blinding of the outcome assessor, the presence of an ITT analysis and the number of patients lost-to-follow-up were scored for each outcome separately. We used the definitions recommended by the Childhood Cancer Group (<LINK REF="REF-Module-CCG" TYPE="REFERENCE">Module CCG</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias for each included study was assessed by one reviewer and checked by another reviewer, who completely agreed with the assessment of the first reviewer. No third party arbitration was needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data of the characteristics of participants (age, sex, localized or metastatic disease, site of disease (extremity or central), prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, primary or secondary disease, linked syndromes and familiary predisposition to cancer (e.g. Li-Fraumeni syndrome and retinoblastoma)), of interventions (drugs, cumulative dose, dose intensity, duration of therapy, hydration status of patients, surgery procedure of primary site), of outcome measures and of length of follow-up were extracted.</P>
<P>Data extraction was performed by one reviewer using standardized forms and checked by another reviewer, who completely agreed with the assessment of the first reviewer. No third party arbitration was needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analyses</B>
<BR/>The data were entered into RevMan and analyzed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Dichotomous outcomes were related to risk using the relative risk / risk ratio (RR). The data were extracted by allocation intervention, irrespective of compliance with the allocated intervention, in order to allow an 'intention-to-treat' analysis. Since only one eligible study was identified, assessing the presence of heterogeneity was not applicable. A random effects model for the estimation of treatment effects was used throughout the review. An outcome measure was only included in this systematic review if it was the intention of the study to perform the necessary assessments in all randomised patients (i.e. not only optional or only performed in some centres). The risk of bias in the included study was taken into account in the interpretation of the review's results. Since only one eligible study was identified, performing sensitivity analyses for the used risk of bias criteria was not applicable.</P>

<P>Response rate was defined as the number of patients with a complete or partial response. A complete response in a resected or amputated specimen was defined as &gt; 90% tumour destruction and fibrovascular change and in a needle biopsy specimen as fibrovascular change and nonviable tumour; a partial response in a surgical specimen was defined as 60 to 90% tumour destruction and fibrovascular change and in a needle biopsy specimen it appeared as scattered viable tumour and fibrovascular change; all pathologic responses were to be supported by confirmatory findings on clinical, radiographic and angiographic examination.</P>
<P>The analysis showed no significant difference in response rate between MTX and cisplatin (RR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.13, P = 0.09) (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> of analysis 1.1). Please note that due to the nature of this measurement (i.e. the number of patients with a response) a high event rate is favourable.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-24 11:18:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As a result of the introduction of chemotherapy, the survival of children with osteosarcoma has improved dramatically from 20% to 50-60% (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Souhami-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Souhami 1997</LINK>). The majority of the currently used treatment protocols are based on a combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, MTX and/or ifosfamide, of which MTX seems to be one of the most active drugs. However, in the literature, this has not been unambiguously proven. This is an update of the first systematic review evaluating the current state of evidence on the use of MTX in the treatment of children and young adults (up to 21 years of age) diagnosed with primary high-grade osteosarcoma.</P>
<P>To adequately evaluate the role of MTX in the treatment of osteosarcoma the best study design is an RCT in which the only difference between the intervention and control group is the use of MTX. Unfortunately, we could not identify such a study. Also, no eligible CCTs were identified. We did identify a RCT comparing MTX with cisplatin, but it should be noted that this study was performed in a different treatment era. Nowadays single agent treatment of children and young adults with osteosarcoma is considered inadequate.</P>
<P>In the study comparing MTX with cisplatin no (adequate) information on overall survival and relapse-free survival was provided. Therefore, no conclusions can be made about differences in survival between patients treated with MTX or cisplatin. However, the grade of histological response to pre-operative chemotherapy is a strong predictor for survival (<LINK REF="REF-Bacci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacci 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>), although this has not been unambiguously shown in all studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>). Our analyses of response rate (defined as the number of patients with a complete or partial response) showed no evidence of a significant difference between the treatment groups. In part of the patients (i.e. those who refused surgery) response was assessed using needle biopsies, which may not have yielded representative samples in all cases. But, as stated by the authors of the study, most pathological responses were consonant with clinical, radiographic and angiographic parameters, so the use of needle biopsies does not seem to have led to inaccurate response rates. The following toxicities were evaluated: toxic death, nausea/vomiting (described as moderate to severe and frequently unresponsive to antiemetics), skin/subcutaneous induration at the tip of the catheter and reduction in creatinine clearance (described as still being more than 60 ml/minute/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Only for toxic death no evidence of a significant difference between the treatment groups was identified; for all other toxicities the analyses showed a significant difference in favour of treatment with MTX. For nausea/vomiting the RR was 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; P = 0.01), for skin/subcutaneous induration at the tip of the catheter the RR was 0.04 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.57; P = 0.02) and finally, for the reduction in creatinine clearance the RR was 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.53; P = 0.02). Quality of life was not assessed with a formal test, but it was mentioned that relief of pain was minimal after the first course of MTX, whereas after the first course of cisplatin there was instantaneous pain relief. Also, the analysis of local tumour resections, which have a smaller impact on quality of life than amputations, showed a borderline significant difference in favour of cisplatin (RR = 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.07; P = 0.06).</P>
<P>Please note that the reason that no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified for both response rate and toxic deaths could be due to the fact that the number of patients included in this study was too small to detect a difference between the treatment groups (i.e. low power). Also, the length of follow-up in this study was only 6 to 12 weeks. This could be too short to detect a significant difference between the treatment groups. Finally, although conflicting results have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Eselgrim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eselgrim 2006</LINK>), it is felt that treatment results are influenced by the dose intensity and plasma concentration of MTX treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Delepine-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delepine 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Delepine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delepine 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Graf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 1994</LINK>). It is possible that the MTX dosage used in this study was not the most optimal dose. A higher MTX dose might lead to a better antitumour efficacy (i.e. survival and response rate). On the other hand, it could also lead to a higher frequency of toxicities.</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the included study was difficult to assess due to a lack of reporting. As a result, the presence of selection bias, performance bias and detection bias in this study could not be ruled out. However, with regard to performance bias, it should be noted that MTX treatment requires close monitoring of MTX serum levels since the necessary leucovorin dosing is based on these levels. Therefore, it was not possible to blind care providers and patients. The risk of attrition bias in this study is low. At the moment this is the best available evidence for treatment with MTX versus cisplatin in children and young adults with a primary high-grade osteosarcoma.</P>
<P>It should be noted that in this review RCTs and CCTs including both children and adults were only eligible for inclusion if the maximal age of the participants did not exceed 21 years. It is possible that there might be evidence on antitumour efficacy, toxicities and quality of life of treatment with and without MTX from studies including both children and adults (for examples see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table). However, extrapolation of these data to children is risky. The aetiology of osteosarcoma seems to be different in adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>). Also, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs vary with age, and their beneficial and adverse effects may be different in adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Groninger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groninger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Even though RCTs are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognized that data from non-randomized studies on the use of MTX in the treatment of children and young adults with osteosarcoma are available. For example, Lewis et al (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>) showed that patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma treated with cisplatin and doxorubicin had a 5-year progression-free survival of approximately 40%, while Meyers et al (<LINK REF="REF-Meyers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 2005</LINK>) identified a 5-year event-free survival of 64% with the addition of MTX to treatment with cisplatin and doxorubicin. However, in both these studies patients older than 21 years were included and the patient populations and cumulative doses of these 2 studies were not completely identical, so an unbiased comparison of these two studies is not possible.</P>
<P>We are awaiting more details on the 5 studies for which the currently available data were insufficient to assess eligibility for inclusion in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-10-23 14:59:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since no RCTs or CCTs in which only the use of MTX differed between the intervention and control group were identified, no conclusions can be made about the effects on antitumour efficacy, toxicities and quality of life of the addition of MTX to treatment of children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. Based on the currently available evidence from RCTs and CCTs, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practice.</P>
<P>Since only 1 RCT comparing MTX with cisplatin (both as single agent treatment) was identified, no definitive conclusions can be made about the effects of these agents on antitumour efficacy, toxicities and quality in children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. No significant difference in response rate between MTX and cisplatin was identified, but with regard to the occurrence of toxicities the analyses showed a significant difference in favour of treatment with MTX. On the other hand, with regard to quality of life treatment with cisplatin seemed to give better results. However, these findings should be confirmed in other RCTs. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to favour treatment with MTX or cisplatin in children and young adults diagnosed with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. Also, this study was performed in a different treatment era. Nowadays single agent treatment of children and young adults with osteosarcoma is considered inadequate.</P>
<P>For other combinations of treatment including and not including MTX no RCTs or CCTs were identified and as a result, no conclusions can be made about the effects of these therapies on antitumour efficacy, toxicities and quality of life in children and young adults diagnosed with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. Based on the currently available evidence from RCTs and CCTs, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-23 15:10:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No RCTs and CCTs in which only the use of MTX differed between the intervention and control group were identified. Therefore, before conclusions can be made about the effects on antitumour efficacy, toxicities and quality of life of the addition of MTX to treatment of children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma, high quality studies need to be undertaken. The most optimal study design to answer these questions is a RCT. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (with regard to for example stage of disease) and have a long-term follow-up. The number of included patients should be sufficient to obtain the power needed for the results to be reliable.</P>
<P>For other combinations of treatment including and not including MTX, future trials should also be high quality RCTs performed in homogeneous study populations with a long-term follow-up. Again, the number of included patients should be sufficient to obtain the power needed for the results to be reliable.</P>
<P>We are aware that in the current treatment era it seems unlikely that a RCT evaluating the role of MTX in the treatment of children and young adults diagnosed with primary high-grade osteosarcoma would be welcomed by many pediatric oncologists (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffe 2008</LINK>). However, it is widely recognized that a RCT is the only study design which can provide unbiased evidence on interventions, provided that the design and execution are adequate. Without evidence from high quality RCTs we have to live with the fact that the true efficacy of MTX in these patients remains unclear.  </P>
