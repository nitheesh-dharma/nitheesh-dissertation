<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:23:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute anterior shoulder dislocation is an injury in which the top end of the upper arm bone is pushed out of the joint socket in a forward direction. Afterwards, the shoulder is less stable and is prone to re-dislocation or subluxation (partial re-dislocation), especially in active young adults. Initial treatment involves putting the joint back in place. This is called 'closed reduction' when it is done without surgery. Subsequent treatment is often conservative (non-surgical) and generally involves placement of the injured arm in a sling or in another immobilising device followed by specific exercises.</P>
<P>After a comprehensive search, completed in September 2013, for randomised controlled trials that compared different methods of conservative management of these injuries we included only four trials, one of which was not truly randomised. These trials involved a total of 470 participants (371 male). All had primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods. Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers. All trials were at some risk of bias (systematic errors that could lead to overestimation or underestimation of treatment effectiveness), with two trials in particular being at high risk of bias in a number of aspects. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the direction and size of effect.</P>
<P>All four trials compared immobilisation of the arm in external rotation (when the arm is orientated outwards with the forearm away from the chest) versus immobilisation in internal rotation (the usual sling position, where the arm rests against the chest) following closed reduction. Investigators followed patients for at least two years. The results showed no difference between the two groups in any of our pre-defined outcomes. These included re-dislocations, scores on validated shoulder function questionnaires, return to pre-injury activity or sport, and any instability. Other pre-defined outcomes (patient satisfaction with the intervention, and health-related quality of life outcome data) were not reported. Adverse events were poorly recorded.</P>
<P>In our recommendations for future research, we point out the importance of completing and publishing the eight other trials making the same comparison as the four included trials. We also note that other important questions need to be studied, such as how long the shoulder should be immobilised for the best outcomes. In conclusion, current evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to inform choices for conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.</P>

<P>Acute anterior dislocation, which is the most common type of shoulder dislocation, usually results from an injury. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and is more susceptible to re-dislocation, especially in active young adults. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-28 10:05:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. These might include immobilisation, rehabilitative interventions or both.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-22 12:34:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2013), EMBASE (1980 to Week 38, 2013), CINAHL (1982 to September 2013), PEDro (1929 to November 2012), OTseeker (inception to November 2012) and trial registries. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing various conservative interventions versus control (no or sham treatment) or other conservative interventions applied after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-22 08:13:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Results of comparable groups of trials were pooled.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 15:42:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial, which involved 470 participants (371 male) with primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods. Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers. All trials were at some risk of bias but to a differing extent. One was at high risk in all domains of the risk of bias tool, and one was at unclear or high risk in all domains; the other two trials were deemed to have predominantly low risk across all domains. Overall, reflecting both the risk of bias and the imprecision of findings, we judged the quality of evidence to be "very low" for all outcomes, meaning that we are very uncertain about the estimates of effect.</P>
<P>The four trials evaluated the same comparison - immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation - and each of our three primary outcomes (re-dislocation, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for shoulder instability and resumption of activities) was reported by one or more of the trials, with two-year or longer follow-up. Pooling was possible for "re-dislocation" (three trials) and for aspects of "resumption of sport/activities at pre-injury level" (two trials).</P>
<P>There was no evidence to show a difference between the two groups in re-dislocation at two-year or longer follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.06 favouring internal rotation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.54; P value 0.77; 252 participants; three trials). In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 247 re-dislocations per 1000, these data equate to 15 more (95% CI 67 fewer to 133 more) re-dislocations per 1000 after immobilisation in external rotation. In a medium-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 436 re-dislocations per 1000, the data equate to 26 more (95% CI 118 fewer to 235 more) re-dislocations after immobilisation in external rotation.</P>
<P>Nor was evidence found to show a difference between the two groups in return to pre-injury levels of activity at two-year or longer follow-up (RR 1.25 favouring external rotation, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.2; P value 0.43; 278 participants; two trials). In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 204 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 41 more (95% CI 59 fewer to 245 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation. In a high-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 605 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to<B> </B>161 more (95% CI 76 fewer to 395 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation.</P>
<P>One trial reported that the difference between the two groups in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index scores, analysed using non-parametric statistics, was "not significant (P = 0.32)". Of our secondary outcomes, pooling was possible for "any instability" (two trials) and for important adverse events (three events, two trials). However, adverse event data were collected only in an ad hoc way, and it is unclear whether identification and reporting of such events was comprehensive. No report addressed participant satisfaction or health-related quality of life outcome measures.</P>
<P>There was no evidence confirming a difference between the two positions of immobilisation in any of the primary or secondary outcomes; for each outcome, the confidence intervals were wide, covering the possibility of substantial benefit for each intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-28 09:51:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous conservative strategies may be adopted after closed reduction of a traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder, and many warrant investigation. However, our review reveals that evidence from randomised controlled trials is only available for a single approach: immobilisation in external rotation versus immobilisation in the traditional position of internal rotation. Moreover, this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate whether immobilisation in external rotation confers any benefit over immobilisation in internal rotation. </P>
<P>We identified six unpublished trials and two ongoing trials that compare immobilisation in external versus internal rotation. Given this, the main priority for research on this question consists of the publication of completed trials, and the completion and publication of ongoing trials. Meanwhile, increased attention to other interventions is required. Sufficiently powered, good quality, well reported randomised controlled trials with long-term surveillance should be conducted to examine the optimum duration of immobilisation, whether immobilisation is necessary at all (in older age groups particularly), which rehabilitative interventions work best and the acceptability to participants of different care strategies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-28 10:01:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dislocation of the shoulder occurs when the head of the humerus (the top end of the upper arm bone) is displaced out of the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. The extent of dislocation varies from subluxation (partial dislocation) to full dislocation (where the joint surfaces completely lose contact). It is usually diagnosed by a combination of history, physical examination findings and imaging - most often radiography (x-ray), but more rarely some other imaging modality such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The direction of dislocation varies, but in most primary (first-time) dislocations, the head of the humerus (the top of the upper arm bone that forms the ball of the shoulder joint) is displaced anteriorly (forwards) in relation to the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). The cause is usually trauma, typically during contact sports in adolescents and younger adults. In older adults, dislocation may result from a fall from standing height. Traumatic anterior dislocation accounts for 96% of all shoulder dislocations (<LINK REF="REF-Goss-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goss 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study based in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Simonet-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonet 1984</LINK>) found an overall adjusted incidence of initial traumatic shoulder dislocation of 8.2 per 100,000 person-years, and estimated the incidence of all traumatic shoulder dislocations - initial and recurrent - to be at least 11.2 per 100,000 person-years. Simonet 1984 was a relatively small epidemiological study that was limited to a single rural county. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Zacchilli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacchilli 2010</LINK> examined the incidence of traumatic shoulder dislocation in the whole USA population and reported that the overall adjusted incidence is more than twice as high as was previously believed (23.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.8 to 27.0, per 100,000 person-years). Seventy-eight per cent of dislocations occur in men (overall incidence rate in males: 34.9 per 100,000 person-years, 95% CI 30.1 to 39.7; in females: 13.3 per 100,000 person-years, 95% CI 11.6 to 15.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Zacchilli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacchilli 2010</LINK>). Although shoulder dislocation is generally considered an injury of young adults, <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1956</LINK> found that there were as many initial dislocations after age 45 as before age 45. Twenty per cent of 545 consecutive patients presenting with anterior shoulder dislocation were 60 years of age or older in <LINK REF="REF-Gumina-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gumina 1997</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Zacchilli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacchilli 2010</LINK> found a bimodal age distribution with peaks in the third decade (corresponding to the peak male incidence) and the ninth decade (corresponding to the peak female incidence). This is broadly consistent with the results of another study, based in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Hovelius-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovelius 1982</LINK>), which found that 35 (1.7%) of 2092 randomly selected people 18 to 70 years of age had experienced shoulder dislocation. Although the overall male-to-female ratio was three to one, the ratio was nine to one in the 21 to 30 year age group and, conversely, one to three in the 50 to 70 year age group.</P>
<P>Once dislocation has occurred, the shoulder is less stable and is more susceptible to re-dislocation. Recurrent dislocation tends to be more common in younger adults. For instance, a 10-year follow-up evaluation found that 66% of those between 12 and 22 years of age at the time of their first dislocation had one or more recurrences, whereas this occurred in 24% of those between 30 and 40 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Hovelius-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovelius 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gumina-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gumina 1997</LINK> found single or multiple recurrences in 22% of those 60 years of age or older.</P>
<P>The nature and extent of damage to the soft tissue surrounding the shoulder joint from a traumatic anterior dislocation vary. Common presentations include the Bankart lesion, characterised by damage to the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum (the fibrocartilage rim that deepens the joint socket) and the capsule surrounding the joint (<LINK REF="REF-Bankart-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bankart 1938</LINK>), and the Hill-Sachs lesion, which involves a compression fracture of the humeral head, as well as damage to its overlying cartilage (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1940" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1940</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-28 10:02:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditionally, a non-surgical (conservative) approach, comprising closed reduction, three to six weeks' immobilisation in a sling and a subsequent physiotherapy or physical therapy programme (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1987</LINK>), has been used for first time dislocations. Recent years have seen much interest in an alternative to the traditional immobilisation method, whereby the shoulder is immobilised in external (outward) rotation using a custom-made (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK>) or commercially manufactured (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2007</LINK>) splint.</P>
<P>Surgical intervention has generally been reserved for cases of chronic recurrence/instability. However, a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2004</LINK>; updated in 2009) comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment found some limited evidence supporting primary surgery for young adults, usually male, engaged in highly demanding physical activities who have sustained their first acute traumatic shoulder dislocation.</P>
<P>Our review considers the various approaches to post-reduction conservative treatment, such as the duration and position of sling immobilisation, the modalities used, and the timing and extent of rehabilitation interventions.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of treatment for anterior dislocation is to restore a functional, painless and stable shoulder. The choice of treatment approach will be influenced by patient age and previous history of dislocation, occupation, level of activity, general health and ligamentous laxity and by expectations of patient adherence to a prescribed therapeutic regimen.</P>
<P>The aim of immobilisation is to allow healing. In this connection, some MRI and cadaveric studies of Bankart lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Dymond-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dymond 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Itoi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitamura-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitamura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liavaag-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liavaag 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moxon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pennekamp-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennekamp 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seybold-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seybold 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegler 2010</LINK>) have shown better and firmer repositioning of the peeled-away capsule when the shoulder is externally rotated than when it is internally (inwardly) rotated - the position naturally imposed by a sling. This has kindled and sustained interest in the possibility that external rotation immobilisation may improve healing, and consequently outcomes, in comparison with the traditional approach. However any immobilisation has potential disadvantages, and there is an argument for shortening its duration (<LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>) or forgoing it altogether (<LINK REF="REF-Hovelius-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovelius 2008</LINK>) to allow early restoration of movement, especially in the middle-aged to elderly, who are susceptible to immobilisational stiffness and frozen shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2012</LINK>) but are less prone to re-dislocation than the young (<LINK REF="REF-Hovelius-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovelius 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, various exercise interventions might theoretically increase functional stability by restoring shoulder joint proprioception (spatial awareness) in the shoulder joint and by retraining muscles to help maintain joint congruency (<LINK REF="REF-Karatsolis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karatsolis 2006</LINK>); while motion-limiting braces might prevent re-dislocation by restricting shoulder movement in vulnerable directions (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2006</LINK> included only preliminary data from one flawed, partly quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK>), which compared the immobilisation positions of external and internal rotation and found no difference in terms of return to sport, re-dislocation or instability. Since then, there has been a proliferation of studies (laboratory-based (<LINK REF="REF-Limpisvasti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limpisvasti 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2004</LINK>), observational (<LINK REF="REF-Dymond-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dymond 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitamura-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitamura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moxon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pennekamp-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennekamp 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seybold-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seybold 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegler 2010</LINK>) and RCTs (such as <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK>)) evaluating immobilisation in external rotation; there are also a number of registered trials. Questions surround other aspects of immobilisation as well (timing of application and duration, position and whether any immobilisation is better than none at all), rehabilitation (its general effectiveness, its relative effectiveness across different settings and the relative effectiveness of different packages and modes of delivery) and motion-limiting braces. These considerations illustrate the need for an updated review.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-28 10:05:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. These might include immobilisation, rehabilitative interventions or both.</P>

<P>We considered any randomised or quasi-randomised (e.g. allocation by hospital record number or date of birth) controlled trials evaluating conservative treatment after anterior dislocation of the shoulder.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2014-04-28 10:09:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individuals who have undergone closed reduction for traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Ideally, the acute anterior shoulder dislocation should have been confirmed by physical examination and radiography or another imaging modality such as MRI. We intended to consider the potential for misdiagnosis, such as a missed proximal humeral fracture, in trials in which the method of diagnosis was unspecified or in which diagnosis was based on physical examination alone.</P>
<P>Although we stated that we would include individuals of any age, we correctly anticipated finding no trials focused specifically on the management of traumatic anterior dislocation in children.</P>
<P>We excluded or would have excluded trials focusing on the treatment of participants with non-traumatic or habitual dislocations, or concomitant fractures or multiple trauma; and those focusing on management of neurovascular complications or postsurgical management. We stipulated that trials with mixed populations involving any one indication of the above would be considered for inclusion if the proportion of the latter (e.g. atraumatic dislocation) was clearly defined for each treatment group and was clearly small (&lt; 10%), or if separate data for acute traumatic anterior dislocation were provided.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-28 10:09:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>To assess whether a difference exists between outcomes of different methods (including arm position) and durations (including none or intermittent) of postreduction immobilisation. However, we planned to exclude trials comparing variants (e.g. duration, position) or supplements to particular immobilisation techniques unless the general effectiveness of the method had been established.</LI>
<LI>To assess whether a difference exists between outcomes of the provision of rehabilitation intervention (of any kind) versus no intervention. Examples of rehabilitation interventions include advice and education, active and passive mobilisation, proprioception and stabilisation exercises, scapular setting and trunk stability exercises. These may be used in combination or individually and may be applied in various ways and settings. Although these interventions are potentially available to all patients allocated the rehabilitation intervention, their actual application may vary according to the perceived needs of individual patients. We aimed to assess this separately for the provision of any rehabilitation (a) during immobilisation, and (b) after immobilisation.</LI>
<LI>To assess whether a difference exists between outcomes of different types of rehabilitation interventions. Comparisons would have included different single modalities or different combinations of rehabilitation modalities. However, we planned to exclude trials comparing different techniques, timing (duration, frequency) and intensity of single rehabilitation modalities until the effectiveness of the modality itself had been established. We also would have excluded trials evaluating pharmacological interventions and trials testing interventions aimed solely at pain relief.</LI>
<LI>To assess whether a difference exists between outcomes of different methods of delivering/providing various rehabilitation interventions. Comparisons would have included supervised therapy versus home exercises, different methods of supervised therapy (e.g. individual versus group instruction) and differences in the frequency and duration of rehabilitation. In the first instance, we did not plan to include comparisons of rehabilitation intervention delivered by individual professionals (e.g. doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists) with different levels or backgrounds of expertise or training.</LI>

Between rater consistency in assessment was checked by one review author (NH) at data entry. All differences were resolved by discussion. We used the tool outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants and of treatment providers), blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias. Considered among the latter were discrepancies in the level of skill or care with which compared interventions were applied (performance bias) and commercial sponsorship (because of the potential for reporting bias). In future updates, we may consider subjective outcomes (e.g. PROMs) and objective outcomes (re-dislocation) separately in our assessment of blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of outcome data.</P>

This we interpreted as follows: "0 to 40% might not be important"; "30 to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity"; "50 to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity"; and "75 to 100% represents considerable heterogeneity" (Section 9.5.2, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We proposed, if possible, to undertake subgroup analyses by gender, as males are at much greater risk of re-dislocation (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>). We also proposed to subgroup by age, using two thresholds: 25 years or younger versus 26 years or older; and 39 years or younger versus 40 years or older. We chose the former threshold because patients aged 25 years or younger are at much greater risk of re-dislocation (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>), and the latter because of the markedly increased susceptibility of patients older than 40 years to postimmobilisation stiffness and secondary frozen shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2012</LINK>); these events would be captured by PROMs (one of our primary outcomes) and &#8220;other adverse events&#8221; (one of our secondary outcomes). To test for differences between subgroups, we intended to inspect the overlap of confidence intervals and to perform the test for subgroup differences available in Review Manager software. We also planned but did not carry out separate outcome analyses of (1) participants who were physically active compared with those who were more sedentary, (2) physically active young adults engaged in highly demanding physical activities who have sustained primary anterior dislocation compared with others, (3) participants with a primary dislocation compared with those with a recurrent dislocation, and (4) participants with a specific lesion resulting from dislocation (e.g. a Bankart lesion) compared with those without.

<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12611001183976" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12611001183976</LINK> is a parallel, two-group RCT with a target sample size of 200 comparing two physiotherapy interventions: strengthening exercises versus pulsed ultrasound and massage, with graduated range of motion exercises common to both groups, after immobilisation in external rotation. The outcome measures are re-dislocation and patient reported outcome measures at six weeks, three months, one year and two years after first-time dislocation. Recruitment is slow, and in a personal communication on 13 November 2012, the corresponding author estimated that completion would take a further 10 years. Because the study is evaluating a supplement to a yet unproven intervention (immobilisation in external rotation), it is unclear how the study will be classified when completed.</P>

<P>None of the study reports mentioned blinding of assessors. Despite this, <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> was judged to be at low risk of detection bias, because the primary outcome measure, re-dislocation, was clearly defined, and participant-reported re-dislocations were verified from medical records. The remaining studies and the secondary outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> (subluxation or dislocation as a combined outcome, or subluxation alone) lacked such verification, leaving them vulnerable to detection bias. In addition, in <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>, although the primary outcomes (self-reported re-dislocation or subluxation) were each clearly defined, the latter was inevitably subjective; in <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>, a definition of "recurrent dislocation" was lacking; and in <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK>, several outcomes were either susceptible to assessor influence or insufficiently defined to allow a judgement.</P>

<P>We did not organise outcomes within our planned framework of short term (up to and including three months following dislocation), medium term (greater than three months and up to and including 12 months) and long term (longer than 12 months) because all four primary studies reported outcomes immediately after immobilisation (some immobilisation-related adverse events) and over a two-year or longer follow-up period, by which time point &gt; 85% of re-dislocations would be expected to have occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects of interventions are reported below (also see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).

<P>There were three important adverse events reported. <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> reported two "complications" at unspecified time points: one participant (1%) of 91 in the external rotation group had hyperaesthesia and moderate hand pain, and one of 93 (1%) in the internal rotation group had eighth cervical dermatome paraesthesia. The other important event occurred in <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK>, in which one participant (6%) of 16 in the internal rotation group had "30° limitation in abduction and 10 degrees in internal rotation in the 6th and 12th months. This patient was 75 years old and had additional rotator cuff problems". Unfortunately, Taskopraran did not clarify whether the limitations referred to were active (as with rotator cuff tear) or active and passive (as with frozen shoulder). Pooled data favoured external rotation (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.46; 216 participants; see<I> </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The imprecision of these results is clear from the absolute effect results: In a medium-risk population, these equate to 14 fewer (95% CI three fewer to 128 more) participants with an important adverse event per 1000 following immobilisation in external rotation.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>, only 68 (80%) of 85 in the external rotation group and 50 (68%) of 74 participants in the internal rotation group wore their splints for the full three weeks.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 17:11:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review now includes four trials with a total of 470 participants, of whom 412 were followed up for at least two years. There was only one comparison: immobilisation in external versus internal rotation for first-time, traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. In relation to this comparison, there were data available for all of our three primary outcomes. Re-dislocation (<LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK>) and resumption of activities (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>) enabled pooling for at least some aspects, and a validated patient-reported outcome measure (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index: WOSI) was presented by <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> but analysed using non-parametric statistics. Of our secondary outcome measures, the "any instability" outcome was addressed (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>), adverse events were reported by all, although on an ad hoc basis, and validated quality of life outcomes and participant satisfaction were not reported at all. No outcome had 95% confidence intervals sufficiently precise to demonstrate clear benefit for either position of immobilisation over the other. For this reason, and other reasons, the quality of the evidence was rated as "very low", meaning that "we are very uncertain about the estimate" (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main results of this review, therefore, are twofold. First, robust evidence for superiority of immobilisation in external rotation over traditional immobilisation in a sling (internal rotation) is lacking, and there is no justification for recommending any change in current clinical practice. Second, we found no includable evidence related to our other objectives.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 17:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite our reasonably comprehensive search, we located very few potentially eligible studies and included only four. The shortage of randomised controlled trials for conservative treatment parallels that concerning the treatment of proximal humeral fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003</LINK>) and the comparison of conservative versus surgical treatment for anterior dislocation of the shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2004</LINK>), and is not unexpected.</P>
<P>Three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK>) consisted of mixed-gender, general populations; while <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK> included males only (whether by chance or intention is unclear), most of whom were military recruits. There was a wide age range (12 to 90 years) overall, though <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> imposed a 40-years upper age limit and the age range in <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK> (17 to 27 years) reflected the special population from which their participants were recruited. Overall, the young and active as well as the relatively sedentary are represented.</P>
<P>We located three other trials, presently described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> tables, whose results should appear in subsequent updates of this review. Two of these (combined target sample size of at least 50) compare immobilisation in external versus internal rotation, and one (target sample size 200) compares two types of physiotherapy after immobilisation in external rotation. Another seven studies are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK> tables. Six of these (combined target sample size of at least 383) compare immobilisation in external rotation versus immobilisation in internal rotation. The remaining study, in press at the time of writing, compares different durations of shoulder restriction (zero, three or six weeks) by a band after immobilisation in external rotation (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus the included, ongoing and unclassified studies reveal an exclusive emphasis in research to date on immobilisation in external rotation, usually as a comparator against immobilisation in internal rotation, but occasionally as the standard immobilisation in studies comparing different post immobilisation regimens. No studies addressed other interventions of interest, involving comparisons of different durations of immobilisation, rehabilitation versus no rehabilitation and different variants of rehabilitation. These other issues remain relevant, as does the question of whether immobilisation is necessary at all for older people, who are at a much reduced risk of recurrence but at greater risk of shoulder stiffness (<LINK REF="REF-de-Boer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Boer 2005</LINK>). It is notable that but for the discovery of a report (published in 1999) that provides a full description of the method of treatment allocation, one well-cited trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hovelius-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hovelius 1983</LINK>) testing duration of immobilisation might have been included (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Also, some key outcomes are lacking in the primary research. Among the important outcomes that have not been directly addressed is participant satisfaction, including the acceptability of allotted interventions. In several of the included studies, participants' adherence to the protocol has served as a proxy for the latter aspect, but the atypical (mainly military) population in <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK> and the high risk of performance bias in <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> confound this. Intuitively, one might expect maintenance of external rotation at the shoulder to be cumbersome. Additionally, one might reasonably expect a heightened risk of accidents. Yet no<I> </I>a priori<I> </I>strategies are in place to collect these or other adverse event data. Other important omissions are very long-term outcomes, notably persistent pain and arthropathy, as well as quality of life, using validated measures, at all time points.</P>
<P>The Cochrane review comparing surgical versus non-surgical treatment for anterior dislocation of the shoulder found some evidence from randomised controlled trials to support primary surgery in young adults (usually male) engaged in highly demanding physical activities who have sustained their first acute traumatic shoulder dislocation (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2004</LINK>, updated in 2009). No evidence was available for other categories of participants. The review suggested that randomised controlled trials comparing good standard surgical intervention versus good standard conservative treatment for primary anterior shoulder dislocation are needed and anticipated that the present review of different conservative interventions including rehabilitation should provide important information in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2004</LINK>). The most important finding, however, of our review is the lack of good quality evidence to permit any recommendations for practice or to inform on the best comparator for trials of surgical versus non-surgical management. Conclusive evidence on the efficacy of immobilisation in external rotation would inform this but is presently lacking. In this light, it is a frustrating limitation of the present review that six completed studies comparing external versus internal rotation are classified as "awaiting classification".</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-29 17:46:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In aggregate, the quality of the evidence was "very low", mostly reflecting limitations in study design (all outcomes) and imprecision of point estimates (all outcomes) as well as inconsistency ("resumption of sport/activities at pre-injury level<B>, </B>with two-year or longer follow-up" and "any instability") and indirectness ("important adverse events"). This grading means that we are very uncertain about the estimates of effect (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). A universally ad hoc approach to collecting data on adverse events hampers assessment of the potential for harms. In addition, poor reporting of how the desired position of external rotation was achieved in locally manufactured splints (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK>) and of the manufacturer's details of commercial splints (<LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>) undermines the applicability of the results.</P>
<P>The previous version of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2006</LINK>) contained only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2013</LINK> was a preliminary report whose findings favoured immobilisation in external rotation, although not statistically significantly so. We reported: "[this study] does not provide the robust and sufficient evidence required to establish clinical benefit. As well as starting off using quasi-randomised methods and then insufficient methods to guarantee allocation concealment, the outcome assessment of <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK> is notably flawed. For instance, trials should measure the recovery to pre-injury levels of all participants and actively record recurrence at set times. Holding the arm in external rotation is more hazardous and awkward for people and so some better monitoring of acceptability, adherence and accidents should also be done. Particularly given that external rotation immobilisers are now available on the commercial market it is important that good quality randomised controlled trials of external rotation versus internal rotation are conducted by independent investigators." </P>
<P>In the present version of the review, <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK> has been replaced by <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>. This was a comparatively large, and potentially influential, study of a sample reportedly distinct from <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK> (personal communication with Prof Itoi, 8 April 2011), with some methodological improvements over its predecessor. Thus there was randomisation, return to activity was evaluated in all participants and there was active recording of outcomes at or after two years, as well as reporting on adherence and adverse events. On the other hand, the start point and the selection criteria are inconsistent across reports (<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Itoi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoi 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>) and may not have been determined prospectively, leading us to downgrade the study to an "unclear risk" of reporting bias. Furthermore, allocation does not appear to have been concealed (tending to cancel any benefit of randomisation). There were also serious problems with losses to follow-up, such that the favourable results were not robust to sensitivity analysis; there was vulnerability to performance bias and detection bias; and the risk of reporting bias was unclear.</P>
<P>Of the three other studies included, <LINK REF="STD-Taskoparan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Taskoparan 2010</LINK> was very compromised methodologically, and its results should be viewed with particular circumspection. For this study, performance bias, attrition bias and other bias were rated "unclear risk" and all else "high risk". This was a small study, however, and the imprecision of its results meant that it was not influential in any meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> were somewhat stronger methodologically. Both reported adequate randomisation, although allocation concealment was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>. But neither had a low risk of performance bias (<LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>: unclear risk; <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>: high risk), and only one (<LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>) had a low risk of detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>: high risk). <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK> had a low risk of attrition bias, however, as did <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> for its primary outcome. The combined re-dislocation or subluxation outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> was at high risk of attrition bias, but, as a secondary outcome, this did not affect the "low risk" grading given using the 'Risk of bias' tool. <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK> was at low risk of reporting bias and <LINK REF="STD-Finestone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Finestone 2009</LINK>, unclear risk.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-04-28 11:43:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We strove throughout the development of this review to minimise any potential for biases. Thus, when feasible, we adhered throughout to the detailed a priori<I> </I>protocol, which detailed every aspect of the review's aims, objectives and methods, and noted any necessary changes in <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>. We conducted a reasonably comprehensive search without language restriction, and the key processes of study selection, data extraction and risk of bias evaluation were each independently performed by at least two review authors.</P>
<P>We contacted study authors for missing data and, when appropriate, methodological information. However, it has been shown empirically that unclear reporting of allocation concealment is itself associated with inflated effect estimates for subjective outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>); therefore, disregarding such instances would have meant ignoring a source of bias. We therefore made judgements on the satisfactoriness of allocation concealment based on the description given in the study report, narratively interpreting the grading given in relation to specific outcomes (i.e. subjective or objective) and did not contact authors for clarification of safeguards.</P>
<P>As previously indicated (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), we recognise the large number of studies awaiting classification as an unavoidable limitation of our review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-29 17:16:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified three systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>) evaluating aspects of conservative care following closed reduction, that is, whether to immobilise, the position in which to immobilise, how long to immobilise and how to rehabilitate, in various combinations. The outcomes of interest were any outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>), recurrent dislocation (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2010</LINK>), resumption of pre-dislocation activity (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>) and functional outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2004</LINK>). All differed from our own methodologically in the inclusion of observational as well as experimental study designs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2004</LINK> concluded that "weak evidence" favoured immobilisation for three weeks over one week in terms of recurrence and functional outcomes, although those immobilised for one week returned to work sooner. However, among the studies supporting this was only one (<LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>) that was reportedly experimental, and this had been excluded by ourselves in this review. The conclusions of <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK> were similar to our own, that is, it is unclear whether shoulders should be immobilised after anterior dislocation, for how long and whether such immobilisation should be in internal or external rotation. More optimistic were <LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2010</LINK>, who concluded, "there is no benefit of conventional sling immobilisation for longer than one week ... in younger patients", but based this upon <LINK REF="STD-Hovelius-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hovelius 1983</LINK> and its follow-ups and <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>; both studies were excluded from our review. <LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2010</LINK> also concluded that, "bracing in external rotation may provide a clinically important benefit over traditional sling immobilisation, but the difference in recurrence rates did not achieve significance with the numbers available". We would downplay this further, based on the results of our own review, for two reasons. First, our review is more current. It includes <LINK REF="STD-Liavaag-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liavaag 2011</LINK>, a study of moderately high quality that failed to replicate the encouraging results of <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK>, both of which were at much greater risk of bias. Second, we believe that our review is more robust, as it excludes <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK>, thereby avoiding the potential risk of including data from duplicate populations, and it identifies the potential for high risk of bias of <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK> by recognising that the start point and the selection criteria of this trial vary across reports and may not have been determined prospectively, raising a question of selective reporting bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-28 11:59:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All available evidence concerns comparison of immobilisation in external rotation, a relatively novel technique, versus immobilisation in internal rotation, the traditional approach to management following closed reduction of anterior dislocation of the shoulder. There is no evidence that either approach is more effective than the other, and none of the included studies collected data on adverse events with sufficient rigour to enable proper assessment of potential harms. There is no justification for recommending that practice be changed.</P>
<P>In general, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choice of conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic dislocation of the shoulder.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-28 12:05:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains a need for sufficiently powered, high quality and appropriately reported (i.e. CONSORT-compliant) randomised controlled trials of key conservative treatment and rehabilitation options for traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Blinding of interventions is not easy to do, but concealed allocation should always be done and, when possible, blinded outcome measurement should be done, as these would improve the quality and validity of future results.</P>
<P>Trials should include evaluation of the use and duration of immobilisation (for example, one week versus three weeks) and timing for resumption of activities that may provoke a recurrence. For these trials, we suggest that some distinction should be made between young adults engaged in highly demanding physical activities, who are at greater risk of recurrence, and older adults who have lower risk of recurrence but are likely to have pre-existing degenerative disease of the rotator cuff.</P>
<P>Attention should be given to outcome assessment in future trials. The use of well-defined and validated functional outcome measures, including participant-derived quality of life measures, is preferable, and individual participant data should be made available. Other important outcomes include participant satisfaction and adverse events. Collection of adverse events data ad hoc, in the absence of pre-defined definitions or strategies for data collection, is a serious flaw that casts doubt on the completeness of data and hampers comparison of risks and benefits. In future studies, key categories of potential adverse events should be established prospectively, and an active strategy should be put in place for collecting these data. Categories should be reported on even if they contain no events.</P>
<P>To ensure that efforts are not duplicated, researchers should consult trial registries before planning further research in this area. This particularly relates to the comparison between immobilisation in external versus internal rotation, along with research that is complementary to these; in these areas, pressing priorities include completion of ongoing work and publication of completed work.</P>

<P>In line with recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration, the review now assesses risk of bias.</P>
<P>For this version of the review, outcomes were revised and, to comply with current guidance of The Cochrane Collaboration, the number of primary outcomes was reduced.

<P>As indicated in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK>, we anticipated organising outcomes within a framework of short term (up to and including three months following dislocation), medium term (greater than three months and up to and including 12 months) and long term (longer than 12 months).

<B>Relationship between this and previous reports:</B>
</P>
<P>The full trial report of <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK> indicated that this was a preliminary study. A subsequent (2004) abstract stated that it was an interim report of an ongoing trial, referred to the random assignment of 96 participants and reported results for 80 participants. The selection criteria had changed in that participants with recurrent dislocations were now included, but humeral fractures were explicitly excluded, as were shoulders not immobilised within three days of injury. The mean follow-up time in the 2004 abstract was 12.4 months.</P>
<P>Correspondence with Prof Itoi (July 2005) revealed that the trial was still ongoing. Results for 131 participants, all with initial dislocations, were reported at an Instructional Course Lecture (Principles and procedures for shoulder instability: an international perspective: non-operative management of anterior instability) at the meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in 2005 (handout provided to authors by Prof Itoi)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK> reports results for 198 participants with initial dislocation, recruited from October 2000, and correspondence with Prof Itoi (8 April 2011) indicates that this study sample does not incorporate that of <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2003</LINK>. However, the start point and selection criteria of <LINK REF="STD-Itoi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Itoi 2007</LINK> may not have been determined prospectively, contributing to the grading of &#8220;unclear&#8221; in the &#8220;selection bias&#8221; section of the risk of bias table</P>
<P>
<B>Method of reduction: </B>manual reduction was by the elevation method (101 shoulders, 57 in Group A), the Hippocratic method (22 shoulders, 13 in Group A), the external rotation method (17 shoulders, 8 in Group A), the Kocher method (16 shoulders, 6 in Group A), the Stimson method (14 shoulders, 8 in Group A) and other methods (28 shoulders) (additional information provided by contact author)</P>
<P>
<B>External rotation brace: </B>adoption of the Alcare brace, which was easier to don and doff than the wire-mesh splint, may have influenced adherence, as well as positioning and standardisation, part way through the study</P>
<P>
<B>Re-dislocations:</B> mostly occurred during the first year (82% of those in Group A and 84% of those in Group B)</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events:</B> were not prespecified as an outcome. However, 6/85 (7.1%) participants in Group A had temporary stiffness of the involved shoulder, which "resolved within a month or two through the use of self directed range-of-motion exercises". 8/22 (36.4%) participants who had experienced recurrent dislocation or subluxation in Group A and 9/31 (29%) in Group B eventually underwent surgical stabilisation</P>
<P>
<B>Adherence:</B> 61/85 (71.8%) of the participants followed up in Group A and 39/74 (52.7%) of those in Group B complied with the protocol</P>

</P>
<P>Physicians were allowed to choose the method of reduction according to personal preference. Details were not reported</P>
<P>Five deviations from protocol were analysed as randomised in the intention-to-treat analysis, as follows: Two participants in Group A were enrolled despite being ineligible (they were recurrent dislocators); one participant in Group B was enrolled despite being ineligible (this participant was a recurrent dislocator); two participants in Group A were incorrectly immobilised in internal rotation</P>

<B>Re-dislocations: </B>mean time to re-dislocation was 10.5 months (range one week to two years) in Group A and 11.6 months (range two months to two years) in Group B</P>

<B>Self-reported recurrent instability: </B>a discrepancy was noted. Participants with recurrent instability (re-dislocation or subluxation) are reported as a percentage of the full sample (N = 184), and yet "only 163 patients answered the question as to whether they had experienced subluxation". There appears to have been an assumption that non-responders had not experienced subluxation.

<B>Loss to follow-up: </B>Rowe and Constant-Murley scoring was planned at six months, and control examinations (radiography and MRI) at 6, 12 and 24 months, thus a two-year follow-up. Presumably the intent was to follow up re-dislocations for the same period. However, individual data in Table 1 indicate that only 12/16 (75%) participants in Group A and 13/17 (76.5%) in Group B were followed up to one year (or were already accounted for as re-dislocators). Only 6/16 (37.5%) participants in Group A and 11/17 (64.7%) in Group B were followed up to two years (or were already accounted for as re-dislocators). Thus, while there was no loss to follow up at the short-term (six-month time point), there was potentially important loss at one year (25% in Group A, 23.5% in Group B) and especially at two years (62.5% in Group A, 35.3% in Group B)</P>
