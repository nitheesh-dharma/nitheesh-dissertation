<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search was updated to August 2006, as a result of which 17 studies have been added to the review along with 23 clinical outcomes. Additional breastfeeding outcomes include: exclusive breastfeeding up to four to six months postbirth; starting other feedings before the infant is two months of age; success of the first breastfeeding; time to effective breastfeeding; number of breastfeeding problems; frequency of infant mouthing movements with exposure to mother's own milk; and infant body weight change. New outcomes related to maternal feelings and attitudes include: preference for the same postdelivery care in the future; perceptions of the adequacy of her milk supply; self-confidence about her child care ability; and parenting confidence. Three studies with late preterm infants who were healthy enough to remain with their mothers on the postpartum unit and between 34 to 37 weeks' gestational age have been added to this review. Additional outcomes related to these infants include: SCRIP scores; number of infants who did not exceed physiological parameters; transfers to the neonatal intensive care unit; and hospital length of stay. A new outcome related to infant behavior is optimal flexed movements. Two outcomes have also been added evaluating maternal attachment: mean % of maternal contact time and maternal perceptions of bonding/connection to her infant. Although 23 outcomes have been added, there are no significant changes from the conclusions of the previous review.</P>

<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Babies are often separated from their mothers at birth. In standard hospital care, newborn infants can be held wrapped or dressed in their mother&#8217;s arms, placed in open cribs or under warmers. In skin-to-skin contact (SSC), the newborn infant is placed naked on the mother's bare chest at birth or soon afterwards. Immediate SSC means within 10 minutes of birth while early SSC means between 10 minutes and 24 hours after birth. We wanted to know if immediate or early SSC improved breastfeeding for mothers and babies, and improved the transition to the outside world for babies.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>There are well-known benefits to breastfeeding for women and their babies. We wanted to know if immediate or early SSC could improve women's chances of successfully breastfeeding. Having early contact may also help keep babies warm and calm and improve other aspects of a baby's transition to life outside the womb.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for randomized controlled studies of immediate and early SSC on 17 December 2015. We found thirty-eight studies with 3472 women that provided data for analysis. Most studies compared early SSC with standard hospital care for women with healthy full-term babies. In eight studies women gave birth by cesarean, and in six studies the babies were healthy but born preterm at 35 weeks or more. More women who had SSC with their babies were still breastfeeding at one to four months after giving birth (14 studies, 887 women, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). Mothers who had SSC breast fed their infants longer, too, on average over 60 days longer (six studies, 264 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Babies held in SSC were more likely to have breast fed successfully during their first breast feed (five studies, 575 women). Babies held in SSC had higher blood glucose levels (three studies, 144 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), but similar temperature to babies with standard care (six studies, 558 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). We had too few babies in our included studies and the quality of the evidence was too low for us to be very confident in the results for infants.</P>
<P>Women giving birth by cesarean may benefit from early SSC, with more women breastfeeding successfully and still breastfeeding at one to four months (fourteen studies, 887 women, moderate-quality evidence), but there were not enough women studied for us to be confident in this result.</P>
<P>We found no clear benefit to immediate SSC rather than SSC after the baby had been washed and examined. Neither did we find any clear advantage of a longer duration of SSC (more than one hour) compared with less than one hour. Future trials with more women and infants may help us answer these questions with confidence.</P>
<P>SSC was defined in various ways and different scales and times were used to measure different outcomes. Women and staff knew they were being studied, and women in the standard care groups had varying levels of breastfeeding support. These differences lead to wide variation in the findings and a lower quality evidence. Many studies were small with less than 100 women participating.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence from this updated review supports using immediate or early SSC to promote breastfeeding. This is important because we know breastfeeding helps babies avoid illness and stay healthy. Women giving birth by cesarean may benefit from early SSC but we need more studies to confirm this. We still do not know whether early SSC for healthy infants helps them make the transition to the outside world more smoothly after birth, but future good quality studies may improve our understanding. Despite our concerns about the quality of the studies, and since we found no evidence of harm in any included studies, we conclude the evidence supports that early SSC should be normal practice for healthy newborns including those born by cesarean and babies born early at 35 weeks or more.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:20:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Mother-infant separation post birth is common. In standard hospital care, newborn infants are held wrapped or dressed in their mother&#8217;s arms, placed in open cribs or under radiant warmers. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and should last continually until the end of the first breastfeeding. SSC involves placing the dried, naked baby prone on the mother's bare chest, often covered with a warm blanket. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neuro-behaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time frame immediately post birth may represent a 'sensitive period' for programming future physiology and behavior.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-14 12:51:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 46 trials with 3850 women and their infants; 38 trials with 3472 women and infants contributed data to our analyses. Trials took place in 21 countries, and most recruited small samples (just 12 trials randomized more than 100 women). Eight trials included women who had SSC after cesarean birth. All infants recruited to trials were healthy, and the majority were full term. Six trials studied late preterm infants (greater than 35 weeks' gestation). No included trial met all criteria for good quality with respect to methodology and reporting; no trial was successfully blinded, and all analyses were imprecise due to small sample size. Many analyses had statistical heterogeneity due to considerable differences between SSC and standard care control groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Results for women</B>
</P>
<P>SSC women were more likely than women with standard contact to be breastfeeding at one to four months post birth, though there was some uncertainty in this estimate due to risks of bias in included trials (average risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.43; participants = 887; studies = 14; I = 41%; GRADE: <I>moderate quality</I>). SSC women also breast fed their infants longer, though data were limited (mean difference (MD) 64 days, 95% CI 37.96 to 89.50; participants = 264; studies = six; GRADE:<I> low quality</I>); this result was from a sensitivity analysis excluding one trial contributing all of the heterogeneity in the primary analysis. SSC women were probably more likely to exclusively breast feed from hospital discharge to one month post birth and from six weeks to six months post birth, though both analyses had substantial heterogeneity (from discharge average RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49; participants = 711; studies = six; I = 44%; GRADE: <I>moderate quality</I>; from six weeks average RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.90; participants = 640; studies = seven; I = 62%; GRADE: <I>moderate quality</I>).</P>
<P>Women in the SCC group had higher mean scores for breastfeeding effectiveness, with moderate heterogeneity (IBFAT (Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool) score MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.15; participants = 384; studies = four; I = 41%). SSC infants were more likely to breast feed successfully during their first feed, with high heterogeneity (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.67; participants = 575; studies = five; I = 85%).</P>
<P>
<B>Results for infants</B>
</P>
<P>SSC infants had higher SCRIP (stability of the cardio-respiratory system) scores overall, suggesting better stabilization on three physiological parameters. However, there were few infants, and the clinical significance of the test was unclear because trialists reported averages of multiple time points (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; participants = 81; studies = two; GRADE <I>low quality</I>). SSC infants had higher blood glucose levels (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; participants = 144; studies = three; GRADE: <I>low quality</I>), but similar temperature to infants in standard care (MD 0.30 degree Celcius (캜) 95% CI 0.13 캜 to 0.47 캜; participants = 558; studies = six; I = 88%; GRADE: <I>low quality</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Women and infants after cesarean birth</B>
</P>
<P>Women practicing SSC after cesarean birth were probably more likely to breast feed one to four months post birth and to breast feed successfully (IBFAT score), but analyses were based on just two trials and few women. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether SSC could improve breastfeeding at other times after cesarean. Single trials contributed to infant respiratory rate, maternal pain and maternal state anxiety with no power to detect group differences.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroups</B>
</P>
<P>We found no differences for any outcome when we compared times of initiation (immediate less than 10 minutes post birth versus early 10 minutes or more post birth) or lengths of contact time (60 minutes or less contact versus more than 60 minutes contact).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-03 10:01:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nancy  Medley">
<P>Evidence supports the use of SSC to promote breastfeeding. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm physiological benefit for infants during transition to extra-uterine life and to establish possible dose-response effects and optimal initiation time. Methodological quality of trials remains problematic, and small trials reporting different outcomes with different scales and limited data limit our confidence in the benefits of SSC for infants. Our review included only healthy infants, which limits the range of physiological parameters observed and makes their interpretation difficult.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-03 19:50:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth R Moore">
<P>In humans, routine mother-infant separation shortly after birth is unique to the 20th century. This practice diverges from evolutionary history, where neonatal survival depended on close and virtually continuous maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC). In many industrialized societies separating the newborn from its mother soon after birth has become common practice. Therefore, for the purpose of this review, SSC has to be the experimental intervention. Ironically, and importantly, the experimental intervention in studies with all other mammals is to <I>separate</I> newborns from their mothers.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:38:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Immediate SSC is the placing of the naked baby prone on the mother's bare chest at birth and early SSC begins within the first day. In the evolutionary context, this would have been "immediate and continuous". In the context of this review, SSC is compared to all degrees of separation, from infants that are clothed but held by mother, to those in a central nursery. The clinical and nursing care does not change; SSC is regarded as the place where such care is provided. Further, although a dose-response effect has not yet been documented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the general consensus is that minimally, SSC should continue until the end of the first successful breastfeeding in order to show an effect and to enhance early infant self-regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Widstrom-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widstrom 2011</LINK>). According to the <LINK REF="REF-Baby_x002d_Friendly-USA" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baby-Friendly USA</LINK> Initiative criteria, Step 4, all infants should be placed in SSC with their mothers immediately post birth for at least an hour.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:39:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The rationale for SSC comes from animal studies in which some of the innate newborn behaviors that are necessary for survival are shown to be habitat or location dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Alberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberts 1994</LINK>). In mammalian biology, maintenance of the maternal milieu following birth is required to elicit innate behaviors from the newborn and the mother that lead to successful breastfeeding, and thus survival. Further, maternal sensations are the triggers that ensure regulation of all aspects of neonatal physiology, including cardiorespiratory and digestive, hormonal and behavioral (<LINK REF="REF-Hofer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofer 2006</LINK>). Separation from this milieu is interpreted in rat studies as sudden and complete loss of such regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofer 2006</LINK>), and results in immediate distress cries (<LINK REF="REF-Alberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberts 1994</LINK>) and "protest-despair" behavior. Human infants placed in a cot cry 10 times more than SSC infants (<LINK REF="STD-Christensson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Christensson 1995</LINK>). Their cry is similar to the vocalizations of separated rat pups using sound spectral analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Michelsson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelsson 1996</LINK>). In rodent studies, the pups who had the least attentive contact from their mothers were the ones whose health and intelligence were compromised across the lifespan (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meaney-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meaney 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plotsky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotsky 2005</LINK>). Also in the report by <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>, a cross-fostering study provided evidence for a direct relationship between maternal behavior and normal hippocampal development in the offspring.</P>
<P>Healthy, full-term infants employ a species-specific set of innate newborn behaviors immediately following delivery when placed in SSC with the mother (<LINK REF="REF-Righard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Righard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varendi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varendi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varendi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varendi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widstrom-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widstrom 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widstrom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widstrom 1990</LINK>). They localize the nipple by smell and have a heightened response to odor cues in the first few hours after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varendi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varendi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varendi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varendi 1997</LINK>). More recently <LINK REF="REF-Widstrom-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widstrom 2011</LINK> described the sequence of nine innate behaviors as the birth cry, relaxation, awakening and opening the eyes, activity, a second resting phase, crawling towards the nipple, touching and licking the nipple, suckling at the breast and finally falling asleep. This 'sensitive period' predisposes or primes mothers and infants to develop a synchronous reciprocal interaction pattern, provided they are together and in intimate contact. Further evidence for a sensitive period is the activation of the olfactory cortex by colostrum, which is only present for the first day of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bartocci-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartocci 2000</LINK>). Infants who are allowed uninterrupted SSC immediately after birth and who self-attach to the mother's nipple may continue to nurse more effectively. Effective nursing increases milk production and infant weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-De-Carvalho-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Carvalho 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dewey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewey 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>SSC is a powerful vagal stimulant, through sensory stimuli such as touch, warmth, and odor, which among other effects releases maternal oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Uvnas_x002d_Moberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uvnas-Moberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 2005</LINK>). Oxytocin causes the skin temperature of the mother's breast to rise, providing warmth to the infant (<LINK REF="REF-Uvnas_x002d_Moberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uvnas-Moberg 1996</LINK>). In a study of infrared thermography of the whole body during the first hour post birth, <LINK REF="REF-Christidis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christidis 2003</LINK> found that SSC was as effective as radiant warmers in preventing heat loss in healthy full-term infants. When operating in a safe environment, oxytocin and direct SSC stimulation of vagal efferents are probably쟰art of a broader neuro-endocrine milieu (<LINK REF="REF-Porges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porges 2007</LINK>). A global physiological regulation of the autonomic nervous system is achieved, supporting growth and development, (homeorhesis). Under conditions perceived by the newborn to be threatening, (<LINK REF="REF-Graeff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graeff 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porges 2007</LINK>), stress mechanisms come into operation, with the focus on survival (homeostasis) rather than development (homeorhesis). The concept of allostasis takes a broader view of homeostasis and homeorhesis, being the relationship between psycho-neurohormonal responses to stress and physical and psychological manifestations of health and illness across the lifespan (<LINK REF="REF-McEwen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shannon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shannon 2007</LINK>). Allostatic mechanisms seek to restore autonomic systems to a healthy baseline. Repeated and chronic stress imposes an &#8216;allostatic load&#8217;, whereby the healthy baseline can no longer be maintained, and is therefore up-regulated or adapted. The higher the allostatic load the greater the damage from stress, because allostatic load is cumulative.</P>
<P>Epigenetic changes probably mediate such change. In development, &#8216;predictive adaptive responses&#8217; have been postulated to make early and permanent gene adaptations in many systems during sensitive periods (<LINK REF="REF-Gluckman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluckman 2005</LINK>). In mammalian studies, maternal-infant separation is regarded as a severe form of stress, with documented epigenetic changes in stress regulation systems (<LINK REF="REF-Arabadzisz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arabadzisz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabatini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabatini 2007</LINK>). The original changes in hippocampal cortisol receptors first described in rats by <LINK REF="REF-Meaney-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meaney 2005</LINK>, are now also being documented in human adults (<LINK REF="REF-McGowan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGowan 2009</LINK>). This concept is now more broadly described in DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease), in which early developmental plasticity impacts &#8220;long-term biological, mental, and behavioral strategies in response to local ecological and/or social conditions&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Hochberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochberg 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>SSC also lowers maternal stress levels. <LINK REF="REF-Handlin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handlin 2009</LINK> found a dose-response relationship between the amount of SSC and maternal plasma cortisol two days post birth. A longer duration of SSC was correlated with a lower median level of cortisol (r = - 0.264, P = 0.044).</P>
<P>SSC induces oxytocin, which antagonizes the flight-fight effect, decreasing maternal anxiety and increasing calmness and social responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Uvnas_x002d_Moberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uvnas-Moberg 2005</LINK>). During the early hours after birth, oxytocin may also enhance parenting behaviors (<LINK REF="REF-Uvnas_x002d_Moberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uvnas-Moberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 2005</LINK>). In the newborn period, stimuli such as SSC, suckling and vocalizations play a role in connecting oxytocin systems to dopamine pathways, neuroimaging shows that maternal neglect is characterized by failure to make such connections (<LINK REF="REF-Strathearn-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strathearn 2011</LINK>). Consistent with this, SSC outcomes for mothers suggest improved bonding/attachment (<LINK REF="REF-Affonso-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Affonso 1989</LINK>); other outcomes are an increased sense of mastery and self-enhancement, resulting in increased confidence. Sense of mastery and confidence are relevant outcomes because they predict breastfeeding duration (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1999</LINK>). Women with low breastfeeding confidence have three times the risk of early weaning (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Campo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Campo 1992</LINK>) and low confidence is also associated with perceived insufficient milk supply (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Time to expulsion of the placenta was shorter (<LINK REF="STD-Marin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marin 2010</LINK>) (M = 409 <U>+</U> 245 sec.) in mothers of SSC infants than in control mothers (M = 475 <U>+</U> 277 sec., P = 0.05). With SSC on the mother's abdomen, the infant's knees and legs press into her abdomen in a massaging manner which would logically induce uterine contractions and thereby reduce risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Mothers who experience SSC have reduced bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Dordevic-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dordevic 2008</LINK>), and a more rapid delivery of the placenta than control mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Marin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marin 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>In previous meta-analyses with full-term infants, early contact was associated with continued breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard_x002d_Bonnin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard-Bonnin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez_x002d_Escamilla-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez-Escamilla 1994</LINK>). Just altering hospital routines can increase breastfeeding levels in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1997</LINK>). The updated review on kangaroo mother care (KMC), (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2014</LINK>) includes 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 2751 low birthweight infants, all less than 2500 g at birth. KMC is defined as continuous or intermittent SSC with exclusive or nearly exclusive breastfeeding and early hospital discharge but KMC is seldom practiced in its entirety. Most included studies focus on SSC as the key intervention, evidenced by exclusive breastfeeding at discharge (and other breastfeeding outcomes) being reported as outcomes rather than the intervention. KMC was associated with reductions in mortality at hospital discharge and at latest follow-up, nosocomial infection/sepsis at hospital discharge and severe infection/sepsis at latest follow-up, hypothermia and hospital length of stay. The current WHO guidelines on newborn care &#8220;WHO recommendations on interventions to improve preterm birth outcomes&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>) advise KMC for thermal care for preterm newborns.</P>
<P>In another meta-analysis of 23 studies (13 case-series, five RCT's, one cross-over and four cohort), <LINK REF="REF-Mori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mori 2010</LINK> evaluated temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation outcomes in both low and normal birthweight infants up to 28 days old; showing small changes of no clinical significance. A Cochrane review focusing on the effect of SSC on procedural pain in all neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2014</LINK>), including 19 RCTs and 1594 infants; concluded that SSC provides effective pain relief as measured by physiological and behavioral responses. A meta-analysis of nine RCTs and six observational studies, all from low- or middle-income settings for infants born below 2000 g focusing on mortality using primarily the GRADE tool (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2010</LINK>) reported that analysis of three RCTs commencing KMC in the first week of life showed a significant reduction in neonatal mortality. A commentary on this meta-analysis points out a number of flaws (<LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2010</LINK>), nevertheless the conclusions are in keeping with <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2014</LINK>.</P>
<P>The possibility exists that postnatal separation of human infants from their mothers is stressful (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1995</LINK>). Delivery room and postpartum hospital routines may significantly disrupt early maternal-infant interactions including breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odent 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1995</LINK>). A concurrent widespread decline in breastfeeding is of major public health concern. Although more women are initiating breastfeeding, fewer are breastfeeding exclusively. Using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II conducted in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 to 2007, <LINK REF="REF-Grummer_x002d_Strawn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grummer-Strawn 2008</LINK> found that 83% of mothers initiated breastfeeding, but only 48% exclusively breast fed during their hospital stay. These innate behaviors can be disrupted by early postpartum hospital routines as shown experimentally by <LINK REF="REF-Widstrom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widstrom 1990</LINK> and in descriptive studies by <LINK REF="REF-Gomez--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jansson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansson 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Righard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Righard 1990</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Gomez--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 1998</LINK> found that infants were eight times more likely to breast feed spontaneously if they spent more than 50 minutes in SSC with their mothers immediately after birth, and concluded that the dose of SSC might be an essential component regarding breastfeeding success. <LINK REF="REF-Bramson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramson 2010</LINK> showed a clear dose-response relationship between SSC in the first three hours post birth and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge in a large (N = 21,842 mothers) hospital-based cohort study, (odds ratio (OR) for exclusive breastfeeding = 1.665 if in SSC for 16 to 30 minutes, and OR = 3.145 for more than 60 minutes of SSC).</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to examine the available evidence of the effects of immediate and early SSC on breastfeeding exclusivity and duration and other outcomes in mothers and their healthy full-term and late preterm newborn infants. Although our intent is to examine all clinically important outcomes, breastfeeding is the predominant outcome investigated so far in healthy newborns. Hence, our emphasis is on breastfeeding, although we also will examine maternal-infant physiology and behavior. The focus of this review is on randomized controlled trials used to test the effects of immediate and early SSC. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2007 and 2012.</P>

<P>All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the active encouragement of immediate or early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between mothers and their healthy newborn infants was compared to usual hospital care.

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-03 20:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth R Moore">
<P>Early SSC for term or late preterm infants can be divided into two subcategories.</P>
<P>(a) In 'Immediate, Birth or Very Early SSC', the infant is placed prone skin-to-skin on the mother's abdomen or chest less than 10 minutes post birth. The infant is suctioned while on the mother's abdomen or chest, if medically indicated, thoroughly dried and covered across the back with a pre-warmed blanket. To prevent heat loss, the infant's head may be covered with a dry cap that is replaced when it becomes damp. Ideally, all other interventions are delayed until at least the end of the first hour post birth or the first successful breastfeeding.<BR/>
<BR/>(b) 'Early SSC' can begin anytime between 10 minutes and 24 hours post birth. The baby is naked (with or without a diaper and cap) and is placed prone on the mother's bare chest between the breasts. The mother may wear a blouse or shirt that opens in front, or a hospital gown worn backwards, and the baby is placed inside the gown so that only the head is exposed. What the mother wears and how the baby is kept warm and what is placed across the baby's back may vary. What is most important is that the mother and baby are in direct ventral-to-ventral SSC and the infant is kept dry and warm.</P>
<P>Standard contact includes a number of diverse conditions: swaddled or dressed infants held in their mothers arms or with other family; infants placed in open cribs or under radiant warmers; or infants placed in a cot in the mother's room or elsewhere without holding. No infant in the comparison arm should have SSC.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:42:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding was unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomization);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison of SSC versus standard contact for healthy infants.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Breastfeeding (any breastfeeding) one month to four months post birth</LI>
<LI>Duration of any breastfeeding in days</LI>
<LI>Exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month post birth</LI>
<LI>Exclusive breastfeeding six weeks to six months post birth</LI>
<LI>Infant stabilization (SCRIP score first six hours post birth)</LI>
<LI>Blood glucose mg/dL at 75 to 180 minutes post birth</LI>
<LI>Infant axillary temperature 90 minutes to 2.5 hours post birth</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomized trials</HEADING>
<P>We included one cluster-like randomized trial in this review with methods described in 'Other unit of analysis issues' below.</P>
<P>If in future updates we identify more eligible cluster-randomized trials, we will include these trials in the analyses along with individually-randomized trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6] using an estimate of the intra cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesize the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomization unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomization unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we included a trial that randomized physicians rather than women <LINK REF="STD-Marin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marin 2010</LINK>. This trial was previously excluded from the review due to its cluster-like design. We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the effects of cluster design (1.33 and 1.34). Assuming low dependence, we adjusted the sample size and event rate for the trial using a design effect of 2. <LINK REF="REF-Pagel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagel 2011</LINK> offers a range of ICCs (0.01 to 0.09); a design effect of 2 uses an ICC of approximately 0.05. These adjustments did not substantially change the overall effect estimates or conclusions for our analyses 1.6 or 1.18. We therefore included unadjusted data in the meta-analyses for these outcomes. We did not adjust for cluster design for the continuous variable 1.28 maternal state anxiety; however, the data contributed by this trial are in the same direction as the other trials in the analysis, with a more conservative estimate of the intervention.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:42:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomized to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomized minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:42:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 40% and either the Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 40%), we provided possible reasons for this in the text. We also explored heterogeneity by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:43:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-11-07 15:43:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we planned not to combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>We planned to carry out sensitivity analysis to look at whether the methodological quality of studies had an impact on results; however, none of the included studies met all criteria for low risk of bias and we therefore did not carry out this analysis in this version of the review.

<P>For our two primary outcomes there were high levels of heterogeneity with much of the variation due to a single study. We therefore carried out sensitivity analysis excluding this study (<LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK>) to examine the impact on results (1.29 and 1.30). For infant physiological outcomes, we also carried out sensitivity analysis removing <LINK REF="STD-Villalon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Villalon 1992</LINK> to explore high levels of heterogeneity (1.31 and 1.32).

<P>The characteristics of the intervention varied greatly between studies. Duration of skin-to-skin (SSC) ranged from approximately 15 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-De-Chateau-1977" TYPE="STUDY">De Chateau 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svejda-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Svejda 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaidya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaidya 2005</LINK>) to a mean of 37 hours of continuous SSC (<LINK REF="STD-Syfrett-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Syfrett 1993</LINK>); in <LINK REF="STD-Syfrett-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Syfrett 1993</LINK> all dyads received 24 minutes of SSC before randomization. All dyads in <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK> also received a brief period of SSC immediately after birth. In contrast, all infants in <LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2003</LINK> were immediately warmed, dried, washed and weighed before receiving control or intervention protocol. Apart from different protocols of SSC, intervention arms had different rates of compliance with the intervention (though not all trials reported this). <LINK REF="STD-Armbrust-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Armbrust 2016</LINK> reported (by email) that two infants randomized to SSC did not receive this due to their need to see a neonatologist. <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK> reported that SSC mothers gave SSC 22% of the time and held their wrapped infants for 11.6% of the observation period.</P>
<P>For subgroup analysis we have compared trials that initiated SSC &lt; 10 minutes post birth with trials starting SSC <U>&gt;</U> 10 minutes from birth. Eighteen of 38 trials contributing data to the review began SSC immediately after birth (please see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Delayed contact trials had considerable differences in timing. Many infants went to their mothers after an initial assessment that was longer than 10 minutes; exact timing was not always described.

<P>No trial was at high risk of bias due to quasi-random methods of sequence generation. In 22 of the 46 included studies trialists described clear and appropriate methods for generating the randomization sequence for an assessment of low risk of bias. For 24 studies we found insufficient information to determine if the method of sequence generation was robust before allocation of the participants to groups occurred; one of these studies used a random numbers table, but there was some confusion as to whether women could have been re-assigned (<LINK REF="STD-McClellan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McClellan 1980</LINK>).</P>

Fourteen of 46 included studies were of low risk of bias for allocation concealment due to use of sequential, sealed envelopes or computer-numbered programs (the minimization method) (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chwo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chwo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gouchon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gouchon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nimbalkar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Nimbalkar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norouzi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Norouzi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Punthmatharith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Punthmatharith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shiau 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Syfrett-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Syfrett 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thukral-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Thukral 2012</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>No trial was blinded for performance bias. Because the intervention clearly differed from the control in all trials, we have assessed all trials as of high risk of bias. We have downgraded all evidence assessed with GRADE for lack of adequate blinding of the intervention from staff and women in trials.</P>
<P>Most women and staff were aware of the intervention, and this awareness may have altered women's responses to questions and influenced the content and quality of care from staff. That stated, many included trials reported different scenarios where blinding of staff or women was attempted. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Ferber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ferber 2004</LINK> stated that the nursery staff were blind to patient group assignment. Surprisingly, several trials attempted to blind for patient performance bias. In seven older studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carlsson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Carlsson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ferber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kastner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kastner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svejda-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Svejda 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1979</LINK>), it was reported that the women randomized were not aware that they were receiving an experimental treatment and/or they were not informed about the true purpose of the study. Adequate control for patient performance is problematic in the more recent studies because of Institutional Review Board requirements that investigators disclose the true purpose of the study or the experimental conditions, or both.</P>
<P>In the majority of studies, control for provider performance bias was difficult to determine, and certainly the risk of bias of an unblinded intervention may differ according to the outcome in question - whether physiological or self-reported. However, due to the very different protocols for intervention and control arms, we have assessed all trials as of high risk of performance bias.</P>

<P>Blinding outcome assessors to treatment group is extremely difficult for this type of intervention, and we found it hard to judge the impact of lack of blinding on particular outcomes.

In 15 trials researchers who were aware of allocation also collected outcome data; these trials were assessed as high risk of detection bias.

<P>A judgement unclear risk of 'other bias' has to do with different types of interventions and control groups (affecting generalizability of results), possible differences in important baseline characteristics between arms, and discrepancies in the published reports. The following trials were assessed as unclear for stated reasons. In several trials, women in the control arms received help with breastfeeding and lactation support (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chwo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chwo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gouchon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gouchon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2005</LINK>).

We were unsure of the impact of possible differences in baseline characteristics in <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2013</LINK>. Other factors noted were: whether the primary outcome of the trial targeted something different from the focus of this review and whether or not the women had analgesia.</P>
<P>For several trials there were factors that we felt deserved a judgement of high risk of 'other bias'. The infants in both arms of <LINK REF="STD-Gouchon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gouchon 2010</LINK> were bathed before returning to their mother, which would impact on the temperature outcomes. For another trial, the results represent an interim analysis and this was rated as high risk of bias; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK> had difficulty recruiting women and stopped the trial after interim analyses favored the intervention. Infants receiving SSC in <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2006</LINK> weighed significantly more than control infants. In the <LINK REF="STD-Marin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marin 2010</LINK> trial, SCC infants weighed less than controls, and the trial report does not offer any details of adjustments made for cluster-design (randomization of pediatricians rather than women). Infants receiving the intervention in the <LINK REF="STD-Nolan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 2009</LINK> trial had significantly higher cortisol and weighed more than control infants; further, this trial had several co-interventions. More women in the control group of <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK> had poor socio-economic status as measured with a socio-economic index score; the authors used this to explain the difference in breastfeeding status favoring the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Syfrett-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Syfrett 1993</LINK> had a very small sample size that was recruited at times convenient to the investigators and multiple co-interventions.</P>

<P>Where multiple studies contributed outcome data, there was often considerable statistical heterogeneity noted. Where we identified statistical heterogeneity (an I greater than 40%), we have drawn attention to this in the text and provided explanation. We urge caution in the interpretation of these results which show the average treatment effect.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes - breastfeeding rates/duration</HEADING>
<P>Immediate or early SSC resulted in better overall performance on several measures of breastfeeding status, although there was heterogeneity between studies. Almost all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Shiau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shiau 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chwo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chwo 1999</LINK> began SSC during the first hour post birth. We found few studies and limited data for many of the review outcomes.</P>
<P>More SSC dyads were still <B>breastfeeding one to four months post birth</B> (average risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.43; participants = 887; studies = 14; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). Overall, there were differences in the size of the treatment effect between studies leading to moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (Tau = 0.02, P = 0.05, I = 41%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Much of the heterogeneity was due to a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK>) where the study author speculated that variation in treatment effect was due to the particular population of women with lower socio-economic status attending one study hospital. We carried out a sensitivity analysis removing this study, which reduced statistical heterogeneity (Tau = 0.00, P = 0.53, I = 0%) and had little impact on the overall treatment effect; results favoring the SCC group remained (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.39; participants = 827; studies = 13) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>). As sufficient studies contributed data to this outcome, we generated a funnel plot to explore whether there was any obvious small-study effect. Visual examination of the forest and funnel plots suggested that there was a greater treatment effect associated with smaller studies and this may indicate possible publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven studies with 324 mother/infant pairs reported data on the <B>duration of breastfeeding in days</B>. Women randomized to SSC were probably more likely to breast feed their infants for a longer duration, though the CI for this analysis just crosses the line of no difference (mean difference (MD) 43 days, 95% CI -1.69 to 86.79; participants = 324; studies = seven; I = 66%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was considerable heterogeneity for this outcome. It was clear from visual examination of the forest plot that much of the heterogeneity was due to the <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK> study where control group women breast fed their babies for a longer duration. We excluded this study in a sensitivity analysis which removed all heterogeneity; results then favored women with SSC who breast fed their infants on average 64 days longer (MD 64 days, 95% CI 37.96 to 89.50; participants = 264; studies = six; I = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK> accounted for all of the heterogeneity in our primary analysis, we have reported the results of the sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>) in the summary of findings, abstract and discussion of this review. We view the result of the sensitivity analysis as a truer estimate of the effect of SSC. We view all results from the Sosa trials for breastfeeding duration as of high risk of bias. No Sosa trial reported a standard deviation for the mean, and so we calculated SDs from the imprecise P values reported (as shown on the forest plot). This estimation will introduce imprecision in the effect estimate.</P>
<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK>) (conducted at Roosevelt Hospital in 1974) was done at a charity hospital when women who moved from rural to urban areas were just beginning to deliver in a hospital; more of these poorer women who were more likely to breastfeed ended up in the control group. The socio-economic index score (includes home environment, education and income) of women in the control group was 11 and in the experimental group was 14. The women in <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976b" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976c" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976c</LINK> did not have an imbalance of socio-economic index score between the treatment and control groups.</P>

<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Luong-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Luong 2015</LINK> utilized SCRIP scores (a measure of infant cardio-respiratory stability in preterm infants that evaluates infant heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) to compare SSC in healthy late preterm SSC infants with late preterm control infants placed in a servo-controlled incubator next to their mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK>) or transferred to the neonatal unit (<LINK REF="STD-Luong-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Luong 2015</LINK>). Bergman used an aggregated score with a maximum of 78 rather than the standard range of SCRIP scores of one to six for a five-minute epoch (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1998</LINK>). Within the SCRIP score, infant heart rate is scored two for regular, one for a deceleration to 80 to 100 BPM and zero for a heart rate &lt; 80 or &gt; 200. Respiratory rate is scored two for regular, one for apnea &lt; 10 seconds or periodic breathing, zero for apnea &gt; than 10 seconds or tachypnea &gt; 80 RPM.

<P>SSC infants had higher<B> SCRIP scores during the first six hours post birth </B>suggesting better transition to extra-uterine life (stabilization), though data are very limited (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; participants = 81; studies = two; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). As a rule of thumb, an SMD of 1.24 represents a large effect. However, we are unsure of the impact of the trialists' averaging of scores at several time points, because there is some evidence to suggest that this practice can contribute to an inflated SMD (http://bayesfactor.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/averaging-can-produce-misleading.html).</P>

A difference of 10 mg/dL in blood glucose levels is clinically significant because symptomatic or high-risk infants may be given supplemental bottles of infant formula, a practice that can interfere with the establishment of successful breastfeeding.</P>

<B>Infant axillary temperature at 90 minutes to 2.5 hours after the birth</B> was reported in six studies including a total of 558 dyads (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Five of the six studies found that axillary temperatures were higher in SSC infants (MD 0.30, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.47; participants = 558; studies = six; I = 88%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). A mean difference of 0.30 캜 does not represent a clinically meaningful difference in temperature. All infants in this analysis had a temperature between 36.4 and 37.1 캜. Results from this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity and studies with very small sample sizes. For <LINK REF="STD-Christensson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Christensson 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Christensson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Christensson 1995</LINK>, infants had SSC or were placed in a 'cot' (bassinet) next to the mother during the first 90 minutes post birth.

In <LINK REF="STD-Luong-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Luong 2015</LINK> control infants were separated from their mothers and covered by a diaper, cap, socks, gloves and a blanket and placed in either a cot or an incubator.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Breastfeeding outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Six studies with 711 women reported the number <B>exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge</B> <B>to one month post birth</B>; SSC infants were more likely to be breastfeeding at that time (average RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49; I = 44%; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Results from this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to moderate heterogeneity for this outcome. All heterogeneity disappears when we remove the <LINK REF="STD-Thukral-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Thukral 2012</LINK> trial, which measured exclusive breastfeeding at 48 hours post birth (analysis not shown).</P>
<P>Three studies with 245 women examined breastfeeding status (using the Index of Breastfeeding Status <B>(IBS) at one month postpartum</B>. The IBS (<LINK REF="REF-Hake_x002d_Brooks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hake-Brooks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1990</LINK>) is a single-item indicator and consists of three major levels of breastfeeding exclusivity -- full, partial, and token breastfeeding. Full breastfeeding is divided into two subcategories. In exclusive breastfeeding, the first subcategory, the infant consumes only breast milk and no other liquid or solid food. The second is almost exclusive breastfeeding where infants are given water, juice, vitamins and minerals infrequently in addition to breast milk. Partial breastfeeding is divided into four subcategories &#8211; high, medium-high, medium-low and low. In high partial breastfeeding more than 80% of the infant&#8217;s diet is composed of breast milk, in medium-high 50% to 80%, in medium-low 20% to less than 50%, and in low less than 20%. In token breastfeeding, the breast is used primarily as a source of comfort for the infant. Breastfeeding is occasional and irregular, less than 15 minutes a day. The infant is weaned when no longer receiving any breast milk. The eight patterns of IBS are ranked as one for exclusive and two for almost exclusive breastfeeding, three for high, four for medium-high, five for medium-low and six for low partial breastfeeding. Token breastfeeding is ranked seven and weaning is ranked eight. All scores were reversed for this analysis so that a higher score indicated more exclusive breastfeeding. There was no clear evidence of differences between groups for this outcome, and results varied considerably between studies; therefore the overall average treatment effect should be interpreted with caution (MD 0.86, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.44; participants = 245; studies = three; I = 90%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different hospital care protocols for women and infants in treatment and control arms contribute to the high heterogeneity for this outcome. The mothers in the <LINK REF="STD-Punthmatharith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Punthmatharith 2001</LINK> study delivered in a Baby Friendly Hospital in Thailand with 24-hour rooming-in for all healthy infants. SSC began 60 minutes post birth and the infants received (M = 30 minutes) of SSC. Control mothers held their swaddled infants after the episiotomy repair. Most of the SSC took place in extremely warm, un-air conditioned eight-bed postpartum rooms with frequent visitors so that contextual issues, such as body warmth and modesty, may have changed SSC desirability and also effectiveness. There were no between-group differences in breastfeeding status in this trial. In <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2005</LINK>, SSC infants were held a mean of 99.5 minutes and swaddled control infants a mean of 60 minutes and both groups were assisted with the first breastfeeding in the delivery room. <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2005</LINK> suggested that barriers to long-term breastfeeding that exist in the USA, especially the customary absence of, or very brief, paid maternity leave, attenuated the effectiveness of early SSC on breastfeeding status day 28 to one month post birth. In <LINK REF="STD-Shiau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shiau 1997</LINK>, mothers began SSC at four hours post birth and held their infants in SSC eight hours daily for three days. Control mothers began breastfeeding 24 hours post birth and they fed their infants every four hours in the nursery. In this trial there was a large difference in breastfeeding status favoring the SSC group.</P>
<P>More infants were <B>exclusively breastfeeding six weeks to six months post birth</B> in seven studies (n = 640) (average RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.90; participants = 640; studies = seven; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>;<I> moderate-quality evidence</I>). There was considerable heterogeneity for this outcome: Chi = 15.92, P = 0.01, I = 62%, so results should be interpreted with caution. Heterogeneity is likely due to the different time points at which breastfeeding was measured.</P>
<P>Two small studies reported no group differences in <B>breastfeeding at one year post birth</B> (RR 6.19, 95% CI 0.82 to 46.78; participants = 62; studies = two; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

The Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (IBFAT) evaluates four parameters of infant suckling competence: infant state of arousal or readiness to feed; rooting reflex; latch-on; and suckling pattern. The infant can receive a score of 0 to 3 on each item for a maximum total score of 12 indicating adequate suckling competence (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1991</LINK>). An IBFAT &gt; 10 is considered successful, and a 2.69 difference in score between treatment groups represents a 22% difference in score and may be clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>Five studies found that infants held SSC were more likely to breast feed successfully during their first feeding post birth than those who were held swaddled in blankets by their mothers. <B>'Successful' meant an IBFAT 10 to 12 or BAT 8 to 12,</B> and the mix of instruments probably contributed to the considerable variability between findings in these five studies (n = 575) (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.67; heterogeneity Tau = 0.05, P &lt; 0.00, I = 85%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

<P>SSC has been widely incorporated into immediate post-delivery care following a vaginal birth in the USA. The 2013 Centers for Disease Control (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>) National Survey of Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (nPINC) found that 72% of maternity care facilities provided SSC for at least 30 minutes following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery most of the time, up from 54% in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>). However the figures for cesarean births are not as robust. Only 59% of facilities reported that they implemented SSC for at least 30 minutes after an uncomplicated cesarean birth most of the time in 2013, up from 43% in 2011.</P>
<P>A number of barriers to SSC in the operating room have been identified in the research and quality improvement literature.

Lack of time, staffing issues and cost concerns can prevent nursery staff from being present in the OR for an extended period to monitor these more vulnerable infants while in SSC with their mothers.</P>
<P>The sympathetic nervous system is not mobilized in infants born by cesarean birth in the same way that it is in vaginally delivered newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Hagnevik-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagnevik 1984</LINK>) where fluid is squeezed out of the lungs during the passage through the birth canal and levels of catecholamines surge. This increases the risk of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB) caused by retained lung fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>). These infants are also less alert and may be less sensitive to odor cues than vaginally delivered newborns making them more susceptible to breastfeeding difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Velandia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velandia 2012</LINK>). Infants who are placed in SSC with their mothers immediately after an uncomplicated cesarean birth begin to breast feed a median of 117 minutes post birth, almost an hour later than vaginally delivered newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Velandia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velandia 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>There were very limited data for all review outcomes from these RCTs, and only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Armbrust-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Armbrust 2016</LINK>) was conducted in the operating room. Lack of data limits the conclusions we can make regarding SSC after cesarean birth.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-07 16:00:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review summarizes the results from 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (3472 mother-infant pairs) that provided outcome data for analysis out of a total of 46 trials (3850 mother-infant pairs) that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 21 countries representing both low-resource and more developed settings. Six of the 46 studies were conducted with late preterm infants and eight with women after a cesarean birth. All studies compared mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) beginning within 24 hours after birth versus standard patterns of care that did not involve SSC.</P>
<P>No negative outcomes associated with SSC were reported in any of the included studies except <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK>, who reported a longer duration of breastfeeding in the control group, and this finding may be due imbalances in an important covariate (socio-economic status).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Breastfeeding/lactation outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Women experiencing SSC with their infants were 24% more likely to continue breastfeeding between one and four months post birth (14 trials; 887 mother-infant pairs). We graded evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, lack of blinding in included trials and statistical heterogeneity with a random-effects model. We were also unsure whether the strong effects found in two small trials suggest publication bias. A GRADE of moderate quality suggests relative confidence in the finding. Future randomized trials of good quality and adequate sample size may change the results of this analysis, but we are probably near a true estimate.</P>
<P>There were similar positive results of SSC for our outcome of duration of breastfeeding, with similar reservations regarding the quality of the evidence. Pooled results for breastfeeding duration (seven trials; 324 mother-infant pairs) showed that women breast fed an average 43 days longer if exposed to SSC, though there was inadequate power to achieve statistical significance for this analysis. However, most of the heterogeneity in this analysis was caused by the <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK> trial and when this trial was excluded using sensitivity analysis there was no evidence of heterogeneity and results achieved statistical significance. Women who received SSC breast fed an average of 64 days longer (six trials; 264 mother/infant pairs). We have displayed the result of sensitivity analyses in our 'Summary of findings' table for the duration outcome.</P>
<P>Mothers who experienced SSC were also 30% more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month post birth (six trials; 711 participants) and 50% more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at three to six months post birth (seven trials; 640 participants). These findings of improved breastfeeding were obtained in diverse countries and among women of low and high socio-economic class. This evidence was also found to be of moderate methodological quality due to unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, lack of blinding and statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Overall, even with the methodological inconsistencies within trials, results for breastfeeding outcomes show benefits of SSC for the first months following birth. Breastfeeding outcomes, in turn, are clinically important for maternal and infant health.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Infant physiological/behavioral outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The SCRIP score as presented in <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK> is a composite measure of transition to extra-uterine life through a time-line, achieving cardiorespiratory stabilization in the first hours after birth. Individual cardiac and respiratory parameters at any particular time point do not as adequately provide a measure of stabilization. Infants whose mothers had SSC had higher SCRIP scores or better stabilization post birth. However, we have little confidence in this finding due to very limited data (two trials; 81 participants) and the possibility that the standardized mean difference (SMD) has been exaggerated by the trialists' averaging of scores over several time points. Though the evidence is weak, and derived only from late preterm infants, it is consistent with studies from mammalian biology (see <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infants who experienced SSC with their mothers had higher blood glucose levels (10 mg/dL on average; three trials, 144 participants) than those exposed to standard care. The methodological quality of these trials was downgraded to low because of limitations related to small sample size and unclear risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. The assessment of blood glucose levels in term infants is controversial and recent guidelines recommend against screening of healthy newborns unless there are risk factors or clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia present (<LINK REF="REF-Adamkin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamkin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wight-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wight 2014</LINK>). Late preterm infants are at higher risk for hypoglycemia than term infants. An arbitrary cut-off for treatment of symptomatic newborns is 40 mg/dL (<LINK REF="REF-Adamkin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamkin 2011</LINK>), and the goal is to maintain plasma glucose between 40 mg and 50 mg/dL (<LINK REF="REF-Adamkin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamkin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wight-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wight 2014</LINK>). A difference of 10 mg/dL in blood glucose levels is clinically significant because symptomatic or high-risk infants may be given supplemental bottles of infant formula, a practice that can interfere with the establishment of successful breastfeeding.</P>
<P>We did not find the mean infant axillary temperature difference of 0.3 캜 (six trials; 558 participants) to be clinically meaningful. In low birthweight neonates, SSC (as in kangaroo mother care (KMC), <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2014</LINK>) is associated with reduced incidence of hypothermia at discharge. Assuming maternal warming of the neonate is the biological default, it is possible that the larger infants in these studies are coping with cold stress better than smaller infants. Regardless, clinicians can be assured that infants who receive SSC are not at greater risk for hypothermia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>A rare adverse event occasionally associated with early SSC is sudden unexpected postnatal collapse (SUPC) of an apparently healthy infant occurring within the first two hours post birth often during the first breastfeeding attempt (<LINK REF="REF-Pejovic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pejovic 2013</LINK>). The incidence of SUPC reported in population-based studies from France, Germany and the UK ranges from 2.6 to five cases per 100,000 births and death rates from 0 to 1.1 deaths per 100,000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 2012</LINK>). SUPC is not an outcome analyzed in this review, but there are several studies of this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Dageville-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dageville 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pejovic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pejovic 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poets-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poets 2011</LINK>). A neonatal clinical evaluation tool, the Respiratory, Activity, Perfusion and Position tool (RAPP) (<LINK REF="REF-Ludington_x002d_Hoe-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludington-Hoe 2014</LINK>) and a surveillance protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Davanzo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davanzo 2015</LINK>) have been developed to assist clinicians in rapidly identifying infants who are becoming unstable. Several hospitals have also developed protocols for safely providing SSC immediately after a cesarean birth (<LINK REF="REF-Barbero-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbero 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grassley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grassley 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schorn-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schorn 2015</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-29 18:19:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth R Moore">
<P>The available evidence does address the review question, but seldom abides by any clear definition of acceptable public health breastfeeding outcomes. Only <LINK REF="REF-Hake_x002d_Brooks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hake-Brooks 2008</LINK> (under <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Punthmatharith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Punthmatharith 2001</LINK>;and <LINK REF="STD-Shiau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shiau 1997</LINK> used the Index of Breastfeeding Status (<LINK REF="REF-Hake_x002d_Brooks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hake-Brooks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1990</LINK>) to measure the degree of breastfeeding exclusivity. In all the other studies, breastfeeding was considered a dichotomous variable. The infant was either breastfeeding (yes/no) or exclusively breastfeeding (yes/no). Further, the actual intervention in terms of timing and duration of SSC was highly variable, and at times very short. Despite this, the evidence is fairly consistent in supporting the effect of SSC on breastfeeding in so far as the findings are numerous and pooled findings are consistently in favor of SSC and show moderate effects. However, for many outcomes findings were from individual studies: the variety of outcomes measured and the lack of consistency in the way outcomes were measured meant that meta-analysis was not appropriate.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-07 16:00:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Evidence for three dichotomous breastfeeding outcomes assessed with GRADE methodology was considered to be of moderate quality. A judgement of moderate quality means that we have some confidence that our results for breastfeeding outcomes approach the true impact of SSC on breastfeeding; at the same time, we acknowledge that future trials may change these results. We assessed the breastfeeding duration outcome and all infant outcomes to be of low GRADE quality. A judgement of low quality means that we acknowledge uncertainty in results for all of these outcomes, and we anticipate that future good-quality studies may change the effect estimates presented in this review. We downgraded the evidence for all outcomes for lack of blinding in the table. Where blinding is not feasible for certain interventions, it is also acceptable not to downgrade evidence for lack of bias. Many estimates in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> had inadequate sample size; many estimates also had considerable statistical heterogeneity, and all evidence suffered from risk of bias concerns in the contributing trials. There are detailed footnotes in the 'Summary of findings' table that explain our decisions.</P>
<P>The high levels of heterogeneity between studies could possibly reflect bias with selective outcome reporting, with data reported on the basis of post-hoc observations rather than predefined public health outcomes. Another possible source of bias concerns the quality of breastfeeding support provided, and whether this was controlled for adequately between groups. In some instances, co-interventions were added to SSC such as music that make it difficult to disentangle the effects of SSC from the other interventions. The variability in outcomes reported, instruments used, context, and timing made it difficult to combine many of the attachment outcomes for meta-analysis. Because of these methodological limitations, the overall quality of the evidence is again considered low.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-07 16:00:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We are aware that the review process may be affected by bias; and we attempted to minimize bias in a number of ways. At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, carried out data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. However, some aspects of the review process involve subjective judgements: assessing risk of bias in included studies, for example, is not an exact science, and it is possible that a different review team could have reached different conclusions about the quality of the evidence. We have attempted to explain our decisions regarding study quality in the 'Risk of bias' tables. We have also provided details about the participants and interventions in individual studies and we would encourage readers to interpret results in the light of the information set out in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables. Several review authors have conducted trials that have been included in this review. All of these trials were assessed by another researcher, not involved in the trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-07 16:01:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The findings are in general agreement with results from other studies mentioned in this review. While we did not find a dose-response effect, in a large hospital-based cohort study (n = 21,842), <LINK REF="REF-Bramson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramson 2010</LINK> demonstrated a clear dose-response effect of SSC on exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge. In the <LINK REF="REF-Bramson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramson 2010</LINK> study there were four levels of SSC. A one- to 15-minute dose was associated with a 1.376 odds ratio (OR) of exclusive breastfeeding during hospitalization, a 16- to 30-minute dose with an OR of 1.665, a 31 to 59 minute dose with an OR of 2.357, and greater than one-hour dose with an OR of 3.145 compared to no SSC. Similar effect sizes on breastfeeding outcomes are reported in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2014</LINK> on KMC with low birthweight infants.</P>
<P>The data from this review are inadequate to demonstrate a dose-response effect. In our review, because of the small number of studies, we were only able to compare a low dose (defined 60 minutes or less of SSC in the first 24 hours) and a high dose (more than 60 minutes).</P>
<P>Data were limited in this review regarding exclusive breastfeeding after a cesarean birth. However, several quality improvement studies (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crenshaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crenshaw 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hung-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hung 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schorn-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schorn 2015</LINK>) have focused primarily upon exclusive breastfeeding during hospitalization. All studies except <LINK REF="REF-Crenshaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crenshaw 2012</LINK> reported an increase in exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge in cesarean birth mothers post-implementation of SSC in the operating room.</P>
<P>Although the modality and timing of measurement of infant temperature varied between studies, minimal increases in temperature with SSC were found in this review. These results support those obtained by <LINK REF="REF-Mori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mori 2010</LINK> who found a mean increase of 0.22 캜. in a meta-analysis of 21 studies of infant temperature pre-SSC compared to during the intervention. <LINK REF="REF-Mori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mori 2010</LINK> also found an increase in infant heart rate of 2.04 BPM in a meta-analysis of 12 studies of preterm infants pre versus during SSC.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-07 16:01:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<I>Breastfeeding outcomes</I>: This review does provide evidence to support current practices as recommended by the UNICEF endorsed Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, in which SSC is encouraged. However, we found inadequate evidence with respect to details of SSC such as timing of initiation and dose. There was no evidence that immediate was better than delayed, however, almost all of the studies began SSC within the first hour post birth. This review does not address subsequent ongoing SSC as an intervention to support breastfeeding. It is, however, noteworthy that an intervention practiced even for a short time at birth should have measurable breastfeeding effects one to four months post birth.</P>
<P>
<I>Infant outcomes</I>: Our review found evidence for a clinically meaningful increase in blood glucose in infants who received SSC. The data for all infant outcomes were limited, and we are unable to provide evidence to inform practice recommendations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-13 17:53:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current recommendations for healthy newborns are that SSC should begin as soon as possible post birth (by 10 minutes) and continue as long as possible (at least one hour) during the first 24 hours. Given the weak-to-moderate evidence for all outcomes presented here, and lack of evidence for differential effect of the timing or dosage of SSC, there is a need for larger definitive studies that make explicit SSC initiation time, frequency and duration. Techniques employed to ensure safe SSC also deserve study. More research needs to be conducted on the effects of early SSC on mothers who deliver by cesarean birth and on late preterm infants.</P>
<P>Breastfeeding outcomes: Clinical trials should consider the mother's prenatal breastfeeding intention (how long she planned to nurse her infant). We also need a valid measure of effective suckling at a single feeding (this may identify problems in time to minimize breastfeeding attrition (<LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1997</LINK>)). Several potential confounding factors for breastfeeding deserve study, including the effects of assistance with the first feeding provided by an experienced nurse or midwife, the protractility of the mother's nipples or presence of a short frenulum (<LINK REF="REF-Dewey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infant outcomes: rigorous and validated composite measures of physiological benefit are not yet available in the literature. This review contained only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christensson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Christensson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mazurek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mazurek 1999</LINK>) that evaluated infant crying as an outcome. The relationship between the amount of infant crying, blood glucose and temperature needs further exploration as crying is theorized to expend calories meant for physiological adaptation. Episodes of hypoglycemia and hypothermia are also important to measure especially in the more vulnerable late preterm infants.</P>
<P>Attachment outcomes: improvement is needed in examining maternal attachment behaviors. Studies should consider using rigorously validated instruments.</P>
<P>Future investigations are recommended because the methodological quality of the included studies is marginally adequate, the characteristics of the SSC and control conditions are diverse, and many outcome measures are difficult to combine. To facilitate meta-analysis of the data, future research in this area should involve outcome measures consistent with the best measures used in previous studies or measures developed to increase methodological rigor, including core outcome sets where available (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1990</LINK>). The CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>) should be used to document the flow of participants through all clinical trials. Investigators should improve reporting of trial methodology and ensure reporting of outcome data is complete. Control for provider and patient performance bias may continue to be problematic for SSC trials due to requirements for informed consent and the nature of the interventions. Outcome assessors should be blinded, however (<LINK REF="REF-Polit-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polit 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>For previous updates we revised the protocol, modified outcomes and updated methods. At a previous update we also decided to exclude quasi-randomized trials.</P>
<P>For the 2016 update we have made the following changes to review methods.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cluster-randomized trials are now eligible for inclusion.</LI>
<LI>Trials of SSC after cesarean birth were eligible for inclusion.</LI>
<LI>We have clarified our definition of standard care to say that no infant in the comparison arms should have SSC.</LI>
<LI>We have clarified our eligibility criteria for types of participants. We included healthy term and healthy late preterm babies. Late preterm infants were those &gt; 33 weeks&#8217; gestation. We excluded any infants &lt; 1500 g or any infants requiring NICU care.</LI>
<LI>We have revised our subgroup analysis of clinical groups to compare the following: timing of initiation - immediate contact (&lt; 10 minutes) versus delayed contact (<U>&gt;</U> 10 minutes post birth), and dose &#8211; high dose (&gt; 60 minutes) versus low dose (60 minutes or less).</LI>
<LI>The definition of outcome from <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> has been changed from exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge to exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month post birth.</LI>

<P>An Assessment Tool for the Observation of Mother/Infant Interaction was developed for this study. It was evaluated for face and content validity as well as inter-rater reliability by experts in the field. It examined behaviors such as the mother&#8217;s affective responsiveness to her infant, eye contact, stimulation of the baby, voice, patience and latch-on attempts primarily on a 5-point Likert scale from rough to soft. The researchers found that mothers in the SSC group were softer in their attempts to stimulate and latch their babies than those in the nursery separation group but had more nipple pain during latch (X was the statistic).</P>

<P>We have reported on results for the Roosevelt 1 study as <LINK REF="STD-Sosa-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Sosa 1976a</LINK>. This study was conducted at a charity hospital in 1974 when women who moved from rural to urban areas were just beginning to deliver in a hospital and more of these poorer women ended up in the control group and were more likely to breast feed. The socio-economic index score (includes home environment, education and income) of women in the control group was 11 and in the experimental group was 14 so the groups were unbalanced as far as socio-economic status was concerned.</P>

<P>This was not a study of late preterm infants. The mean GA was 32.45 weeks KMC and 31.59 weeks CMC infants. The mean birthweight was 1514.8 g (range 1000 g to 1900 g) for KMC and 1471.8 g (range 930 g to 1900 g) for CMC infants. 58% of the KMC and 52% of CMC infants were on IV fluids and 34% of the KMC and 37% of the CMC infants were on oxygen through nasopharyngeal catheter. In addition, these infants experienced significant morbidity; 22.5% of the KMC infants and 38% of the CMC infants died during the study period. Infants were randomly assigned using a list of random numbers to conventional care (n = 61, overhead lamp warmers or a heated room, oxygen therapy, breast, tube, cup or mixed feedings) or early KMC (n = 62) starting during the first 24 h of life (mean age 10 h KMC, 9.8 CMC).</P>

<SUP>12</SUP>Estimate based on small sample size. We also have some reservations regarding the trials' averaging SCRIP scores across repeated measures, as was done in both trials included in this analysis. Averaging will reduce the variability in infants' scores, reducing also the standard deviation. A smaller SD will increase the SMD, even if the actual difference between groups is not large.
