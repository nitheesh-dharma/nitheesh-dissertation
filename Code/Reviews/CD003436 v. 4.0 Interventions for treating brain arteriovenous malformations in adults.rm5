<P>Haemorrhage into the brain, known as intracerebral haemorrhage or ICH for short, is a devastating condition that kills four in 10 people within one month. Brain AVMs are the single most common cause of stroke due to ICH in young adults. Brain AVMs can also leave young people disabled for life and cause epilepsy. How they should be treated, if at all, is highly controversial. The main options are: (1) medical management of epileptic seizures and headaches (sometimes known as 'conservative'); or (2) one or more of the following 'interventional' treatments: neurosurgery, endovascular embolisation (glue, coils, or particles are lodged within the AVM via a catheter inserted temporarily in the groin), or radiotherapy (a non-invasive treatment involving radiation). In this systematic review of the literature, we found only one ongoing randomised controlled trial that will help to decide whether to use interventional treatments for brain AVMs that have never bled (<A HREF="http://www.ARUBAstudy.org">www.arubastudy.org</A>), but there were no trials addressing whether AVMs that have bled are best treated by one intervention or another.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-19 20:33:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the single most common cause of intracerebral haemorrhage in young adults. Brain AVMs also cause seizure(s) and focal neurological deficits (in the absence of haemorrhage, migraine or an epileptic seizure); approximately one fifth are incidental discoveries. Various interventions are used in an attempt to eradicate brain AVMs: neurosurgical excision, stereotactic radiotherapy/'radiosurgery' (using gamma knife, linear accelerator, proton beam, or 'Cyber Knife'), endovascular embolisation (using glues, particles, fibres, coils, or balloons), and staged combinations of these interventions. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-12-04 16:29:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Ross">
<P>To assess the clinical effects of interventions to treat brain AVMs in adults (with the aim of either partial obliteration or total eradication), using data published in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:55:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched November 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 4, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to November 2009). We searched international registers of clinical trials, the contents pages of relevant journals, and bibliographies of relevant articles (November 2009). We also contacted manufacturers of interventional treatments for brain AVMs (March 2005).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We sought randomised trials of any or all of the interventions for brain AVMs, compared against each other or against usual medical therapy, with relevant clinical outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:33:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and reviewed the relevant studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-11 14:40:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One ongoing RCT fulfils the selection criteria for this review: A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA, <A HREF="http://www.arubastudy.org">www.arubastudy.org</A>), comparing interventional treatment versus medical management for brain AVMs that have never bled. We also found two RCTs which tested the equivalence of two embolic agents for the pre-operative embolisation of brain AVMs (one published, one unpublished), but none of the primary or secondary outcome measures in these trials met our desired criteria. We also excluded a third RCT which studied three different blood pressure lowering treatments to induce deliberate hypotension during surgical resection of brain AVMs because the intervention was not the focus of this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:55:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials with clear clinical outcomes comparing different interventional treatments for brain AVMs against each other or against usual medical therapy to guide the interventional treatment of brain AVMs in adults. One such trial (ARUBA) is ongoing.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:55:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:55:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are distinguished from other types of intracranial vascular malformation by having a tangled anastomosis of arteries and veins (without intervening capillaries) in the brain parenchyma. Arteriovenous shunting occurs in a central nidus (the point towards which one or more feeding arteries converge and from which one or more veins drain) (<LINK REF="REF-Doppman-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doppman 1971</LINK>). Brain AVMs are sometimes accompanied by arterial aneurysms within the nidus, on vessels feeding it, or on vessels remote from it. The other types of intracranial vascular malformation (such as cavernous and venous malformations) are classified separately from brain AVMs, not only on the basis of morphological differences, but also because of broad differences in prognosis and response to the different interventions available. A description suitable for non-medical readers can be found in the information leaflet, 'Vascular malformations of the brain' published by the Brain and Spine foundation (freely downloadable in PDF format from <A HREF="http://www.brainandspine.org.uk/">http://www.brainandspine.org.uk/</A>).</P>
<P>The cause of brain AVMs is unknown, but it is assumed to be multifactorial with contributions from both genetic polymorphisms and environmental exposures (<LINK REF="REF-Lasjaunias-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasjaunias 1997</LINK>). Although brain AVMs have long been assumed to be congenital, whilst possible, there is no strong evidence for this. Brain AVMs do affect neonates and can arise early in childhood, but most come to light in young adults, and an unknown number remain asymptomatic. We have not addressed the management of brain AVMs in children in this review, because their morphology, clinical features and management tend to differ from AVMs in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lasjaunias-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasjaunias 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Technological advances in both non-invasive imaging of the brain and catheter angiography, and their widening availability, have increased the rate of detection of brain AVMs (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>). A contemporary estimate of their prevalence is approximately 18 per 100,000 adults (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Shahi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Shahi 2002</LINK>), and their incidence in unselected populations is approximately one per 100,000 adults per year (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Shahi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Shahi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stapf-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapf 2003</LINK>). It is known that brain AVMs account for 1% to 2% of all strokes, 4% of strokes in young adults, and 9% of subarachnoid haemorrhages. Although brain AVMs are responsible for 4% of all intracerebral haemorrhages, they cause as many as one-third in young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Shahi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Shahi 2001</LINK>). Brain AVMs also cause focal and secondary generalised seizures. Brain AVMs also seem to cause transient, persistent or progressive focal neurological deficits (in the absence of haemorrhage, migraine or an epileptic seizure). However, there is uncertainty about their role in causing other symptoms such as cognitive impairment and headache. There are limited high quality data about brain AVM clinical course and prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Shahi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Shahi 2001</LINK>): the long-term crude annual case fatality is 1% to 1.5%, the crude annual risk of first occurrence of haemorrhage from an unruptured AVM is approximately 1%, but the risk of recurrent haemorrhage may be as high as 34% in the first year (<LINK REF="REF-Stapf-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapf 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-12-03 09:30:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rustam Al-Shahi Salman">
<P>Complete obliteration of the brain AVM nidus probably causes a reduction in case fatality and in the subsequent occurrence or recurrence of haemorrhage and epilepsy. These benefits may, of course, be offset by the risks of the interventional treatment itself. Small, simple, superficial lesions with cortical venous drainage in 'non-eloquent' areas of the brain are amenable to complete microsurgical excision. But neurosurgery carries the risks of a craniotomy and general anaesthetic in addition to the operative hazards of excising a brain AVM. The use of either linear accelerator or gamma knife stereotactic radiotherapy ('radiosurgery') is limited to brain AVMs with a compact nidus of 3 cm diameter or less (with or without prior endovascular embolisation), and approximately two years after treatment it achieves radiographic evidence of nidus obliteration in 50% to 80%. Stereotactic radiotherapy leaves people exposed to the risk of haemorrhage before occlusion, which may be incomplete, and radionecrosis of adjacent brain. Endovascular embolisation can occlude brain AVMs completely (depending on their vascular anatomy, or 'angioarchitecture'), and is also used for nidus volume reduction prior to radiosurgery or neurosurgery. The benefits of embolisation may be offset by the risk of vessel or aneurysm rupture, and the reflux of embolic agents into vessels supplying eloquent areas of the brain.</P>
<P>The decision to treat is currently based on a comparison of an estimate of a patient's likely untreated clinical course with estimates of the effectiveness and adverse effects of the different interventions for brain AVMs, published in case series. The Spetzler-Martin grading system is used by many to estimate the risk of surgical intervention by grading AVMs on a five-point scale, determined by their maximum nidus diameter, pattern of venous drainage, and 'eloquence' of adjacent brain (<LINK REF="REF-Spetzler-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spetzler 1986</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-12-03 09:30:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rustam Al-Shahi Salman">
<P>Because there are no existing systematic reviews of interventions for brain AVMs (although brain AVM management reviews/guidelines do exist (<LINK REF="REF-AVM-Study-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AVM Study Group 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogilvy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvy 2001</LINK>)) we have searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventional treatments for brain AVMs in adults.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:34:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our primary objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of the different interventions, alone or in combination, for treating brain AVMs in adults compared against either each other, or conservative management, in RCTs.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-05-11 13:56:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We have sought all unconfounded, truly randomised comparisons, published in any year, concurrently comparing one intervention (or combination of interventions) either against control, or against another intervention (or combination of interventions). Allocation to either treatment group must have been truly random (for example, we will not include trials using allocation by alternation, date of birth, day of the week, hospital number, or an unconcealed random number list since foreknowledge of treatment allocation might bias results), with adequate concealment of allocation.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We have sought trials involving adult humans (aged 16 years or over) with a radiologically definite brain AVM that has not previously been treated, in people with any type of clinical presentation (haemorrhage, epilepsy, incidental discovery, focal neurological deficit). We have excluded any studies involving people with other types of intracranial vascular malformation, such as cavernous (<LINK REF="REF-Rigamonti-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigamonti 1987</LINK>) and venous (<LINK REF="REF-Rigamonti-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigamonti 1988</LINK>) malformations in which arteriovenous shunting does not occur, and we have also excluded studies of AVMs solely involving the dura mater rather than the brain parenchyma.</P>

<P>We independently extracted and cross-checked data (blinded to the study authors) on trial design, the intervention(s) and outcomes during follow up. We intended to perform an intention-to-treat analysis using data on the number of people with each outcome event in each allocated treatment group, regardless of compliance and irrespective of whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. Ideally, we would also have collected data on age at presentation (that is, the clinical event that led to the diagnosis of a brain AVM), the delay from presentation to trial entry, the mode of presentation, demographics of the adults included, certain angioarchitectural features (maximum nidus diameter, presence and location of aneurysms, and deep/superficial venous drainage) and the type of intervention(s) used. If important data were not available in a publication, we contacted the principal investigator of the trial for further information.</P>

<P>Because outcome events from brain AVMs are relatively infrequent, and because it is likely that the length of follow-up in any trials will be variable, we would ideally have liked to analyse outcomes at one - and preferably five - years following randomisation. Where possible, we intended to calculate odds ratios and absolute risk reductions (using the Peto odds ratio to calculate absolute risks across a variety of control group risks) for each dichotomous outcome, calculate hazard ratios for each time-to-event outcome, and use a random-effects model. If we had identified more than one comparable study, a weighted estimate of the odds ratio across studies would have been calculated using the Peto method.</P>

<P>One ongoing RCT fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-ARUBA" TYPE="STUDY">ARUBA</LINK>). A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (<A HREF="http://www.arubastudy.org/">http://www.arubastudy.org/</A>) is an international, multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open, prospective clinical trial comparing interventional treatment (endovascular, surgical, and/or radiation therapy) versus medical management for unruptured brain AVMs in adults.</P>
<P>The intended sample size is a 1:1 random assignment of 400 patients (JP Mohr, personal communication) aged 18 years and over, diagnosed with an unruptured brain AVM considered treatable by the local investigators. The endpoint is a composite event of death from any cause or stroke (haemorrhage or infarction confirmed by imaging). Secondary outcomes include risk of death or clinical impairment (Rankin Score of 2 or greater) at a minimum of five years post-randomisation with clinical outcome status measured by the Rankin Scale, NIHSS, and EuroQuol. Patients are randomly assigned to best possible interventional treatment (endovascular, surgical, and/or radiation therapy) versus medical management alone and are followed for a minimum of five years from randomisation. ARUBA's primary aim is to determine whether medical management is superior (or, alternatively, not inferior) to interventional treatment for preventing the composite outcome of death from any cause or stroke (symptomatic haemorrhage or infarction confirmed by imaging). ARUBA's secondary aim is to determine whether medical management of unruptured brain AVMs decreases the risk of death or clinical impairment (Rankin Score of 2 or greater) at five years post-randomisation compared to invasive treatment. ARUBA had enrolled 107 patients on 26 February 2010.</P>

<EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:56:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We excluded the RCT which studied three different blood-pressure-lowering treatments to induce deliberate hypotension during surgical resection of brain AVMs (<LINK REF="STD-Ornstein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ornstein 1991</LINK>) because the intervention was not the focus of this review.</P>
<P>We have also excluded the RCT which intended to test equivalence between the embolic agents n-Butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) liquid and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles for the pre-operative embolisation of brain AVMs (<LINK REF="STD-n_x002d_BCA-Trial-2002" TYPE="STUDY">n-BCA Trial 2002</LINK>). The study was conducted to obtain USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the use of n-BCA. Following correspondence with the <LINK REF="STD-n_x002d_BCA-Trial-2002" TYPE="STUDY">n-BCA Trial 2002</LINK> principal investigator (Thomas A Tomsick, Department of Radiology, University Hospital, Ohio, USA): the random allocation sequence was contained within consecutively numbered randomisation envelopes (although we do not know how the sequence was generated); unblinding may have affected patients (after their embolisation, which was not performed under general anaesthesia) and the central radiologist determining the degree of vascular occlusion achieved was unblinded because n-BCA is radiopaque. The trial was funded by Cordis Neurovascular, manufacturers of n-BCA. None of the primary or secondary outcome measures in the <LINK REF="STD-n_x002d_BCA-Trial-2002" TYPE="STUDY">n-BCA Trial 2002</LINK> met our inclusion criteria; the primary outcome was the degree of vascular occlusion achieved (judged by the per cent nidus reduction and number of feeding vessels treated on catheter angiography), and secondary outcomes were the duration of subsequent surgical resection and the number of transfusions required during surgery. Although important clinical outcomes were reported (such as deaths, intracranial haemorrhages, Glasgow Outcome Scale, etc), absolute numbers were not reported and it was not entirely clear that these outcomes were assessed at a standard time interval after treatment, making a meaningful comparison between treatment arms of the RCT impossible.</P>
<P>Following personal communication with Dr Gary Duckwiler (Department of Radiology, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, USA), we found one unpublished 'non-inferiority' RCT comparing the liquid embolic agent Onyx with n-BCA for the pre-operative embolisation of brain AVMs (<LINK REF="STD-MTI-Onyx" TYPE="STUDY">MTI Onyx</LINK>). This study was sponsored by Microtherapeutics Inc (MTI), the manufacturers of Onyx, and the preliminary results are available on the USA Food and Drug Administration website. We excluded this study too, because its outcome measures failed to meet our inclusion criteria.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-12-04 16:29:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Ross">
<P>Apart from three RCTs that do not satisfy all of the inclusion criteria for this review, and one ongoing RCT (<LINK REF="STD-ARUBA" TYPE="STUDY">ARUBA</LINK>), the medical literature is composed exclusively of reports of uncontrolled case series of interventional treatments for brain AVMs. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:56:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Until now, the major dilemmas in the management of brain AVMs in clinical practice have not yet been addressed in RCTs. It is hoped that the results of the ongoing <LINK REF="STD-ARUBA" TYPE="STUDY">ARUBA</LINK> study will address some of the uncertainties surrounding whether and how to treat unruptured brain AVMs.</P>
<P>North American multidisciplinary management guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvy 2001</LINK>) have recommended the following approach.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Surgical excision is the single treatment of choice for Spetzler-Martin grade I and II brain AVMs.</LI>
<LI>Radiosurgery is the preferred single treatment for small (less than 3 cm diameter) grade I and II brain AVMs if the vascular anatomy is unsuitable for surgery.</LI>
<LI>A combined approach to eradicate the brain AVM nidus using embolisation - perhaps repeatedly - prior to surgery or radiosurgery is the treatment of choice for other suitable grade II to V lesions.</LI>
<LI>Surgery alone is unsuitable for grade IV and V brain AVMs.</LI>
<LI>Palliative embolisation (without complete brain AVM eradication) is beneficial when a reduced arterial inflow is required in view of venous outflow obstruction or true 'steal' (<LINK REF="REF-Mast-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mast 1995</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Despite this apparent consensus, based on non-randomised evidence, brain AVMs now pose a regular management problem because the pace of development of surgical, endovascular and radiation therapies has largely overtaken the impetus to study the 'untreated' clinical course of brain AVMs. Not surprisingly, therefore, there is disagreement about whether to treat patients at all, and if so, which intervention(s) to use. This is based on uncertainty about the risks of treatment compared with the long-term clinical course of people with an untreated brain AVM (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Shahi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Shahi 2001</LINK>), and the benefits/risks of one type of intervention compared with others. This uncertainty is reflected by the variation in current treatment practices within and between different countries. For example, the treatment of small, superficial brain AVMs may be equally appealing to neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists, depending to some extent on the clinical history, location and angioarchitecture of the brain AVM, but surgical excision is likely to be used in North America (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvy 2001</LINK>), whilst there is a growing tendency in Europe to use endovascular techniques to treat such brain AVMs.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-05-20 13:56:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>RCTs would be the ideal method of evaluation of these interventions because of the uncertainty about whether to intervene at all (for example, in older people and in subgroups with a more benign prognosis, such as unruptured brain AVMs). RCTs might also settle the uncertainty about which of the interventions to use when treatment seems appropriate (for example previously ruptured, small, uncomplicated, superficial AVMs in brain areas that are not eloquent, and which might be equally suited to surgical resection or endovascular embolisation). In view of the heterogeneity of brain AVMs and relative infrequency of outcome events, such RCTs should be large, inevitably requiring multi-centre collaboration because of the rarity of brain AVMs (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Shahi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Shahi 2005</LINK>). Follow-up in these RCTs should be long enough to ascertain a sufficient number of early and delayed outcomes to determine effectiveness or equivalence of interventions. To be meaningful and encompass the potential adverse effects of interventions, these outcomes should include case fatality (both all-cause and brain AVM-related), first-ever and recurrent intracranial haemorrhage, first-ever and recurrent epileptic seizure(s), measures of disability/dependence and quality of life, and an assessment of obliteration/recurrence of the brain AVM.</P>

<P>There is evidence from observational cohorts that interventional treatment may be detrimental for unruptured brain AVMs compared with their untreated clinical course (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wedderburn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedderburn 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-ARUBA" TYPE="STUDY">ARUBA</LINK>, a RCT comparing any form(s) of intervention (e.g. endovascular embolisation, radiosurgery, microneurosurgery) versus symptomatic medical management, is now underway (<A HREF="http://www.arubastudy.org/">http://www.arubastudy.org/</A>). Whether or not conservative management proves no worse, or possibly better than interventional therapy, long-term follow-up of the participants in this RCT will be needed.</P>

<P>This was a prospective, multi-centre, single-blind, randomised trial. It involved patients undergoing pre-operative endovascular embolisation of a brain AVM. The interventions studied were liquid n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA)/tantalum powder/ethiodised oil mixture, compared with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles +/- coils. The primary outcome measures (% reduction of maximum AVM nidus dimensions in 3 planes on post-embolisation catheter angiography, and mean number of feeding vessels embolised) and secondary outcome measures (surgical resection time, transfusion/fluid requirements during surgery) did not meet the selection criteria for this review. Clinical outcome data (Glasgow Outcome Score and NIH Stroke Score) were provided, but at unspecified points following treatment, making meaningful analysis impossible. The reported analysis was not truly intention-to-treat.</P>
