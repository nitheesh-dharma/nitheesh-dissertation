<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-25 17:26:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis. Although any part of the body may be affected, the most commonly affected sites are the elbows, knees, and scalp. 'Topical' treatments (i.e. treatments applied to the skin) are usually tried first. These include vitamin D products, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and vitamin A products. As chronic plaque psoriasis is a long-term condition, it is important to find out which treatments work best and what adverse effects they have. This review describes average benefits of different treatments, while recognising that individuals will vary in their experience of each treatment.</P>
<P>The evidence was based on 177 studies, which, in total, included 34,808 people. Studies were typically about 7 weeks' long, but this ranged from 1 week to 52 weeks. Vitamin D products were found to work better than placebo (the base cream or ointment). Potent topical corticosteroids (strong, e.g. betamethasone dipropionate) and very potent (very strong, e.g. clobetasol propionate) topical corticosteroids were also effective.</P>
<P>Some studies compared vitamin D products directly with potent or very potent corticosteroids. These products had similar effects when applied to the body, but corticosteroids worked better than vitamin D for scalp psoriasis. Treatment that combined vitamin D with a corticosteroid was more effective than vitamin D alone and more effective than the topical corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D products generally performed better than coal tar, but studies found conflicting results when comparing vitamin D with dithranol.</P>
<P>Whether applied to the body or to the scalp, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause 'local adverse events', such as skin irritation or burning, and people were therefore more likely to stop using vitamin D products. When studies examined whether topical treatments had effects within the body ('systemic adverse events'), we found no difference between placebo and any other treatment. However, this may be because many trials did not properly assess systemic adverse events, rather than because there really was no difference.</P>
<P>More long-term studies would help doctors and people with psoriasis decide on the best way to treat this chronic condition.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-25 12:11:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-02-25 16:30:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>To compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-25 17:20:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years).</P>
<P>We identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies.</P>
<P>A separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005).</P>
<P>Final update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-01-21 17:01:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Mason">
<P>Randomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-06 09:47:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long-term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-25 17:22:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>This update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies.</P>
<P>When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.67 (95% CI -1.04 to -0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice-daily becocalcidiol to SMD -1.66 (95% CI -2.66 to -0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once-daily paricalcitol. On a 6-point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.72; I² statistic = 65.1%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD -1.56; 95% CI -1.87 to -1.26); I² statistic = 81.7%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6-point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo.</P>
<P>Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo-controlled trials supported these findings.</P>
<P>For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-07 09:57:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Corticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long-term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-25 17:30:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a prevalence ranging from between 1% and 2% in the UK and northern European populations (<LINK REF="REF-Hellgren-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellgren 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krueger-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krueger 1984</LINK>) to 0.1% to 0.3% in the Far East (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1949</LINK>) and China (<LINK REF="REF-Yip-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yip 1984</LINK>). Psoriasis comprises multiple phenotypes and may be localised (e.g. to the skin-fold areas (inverse psoriasis), the palms, or the soles) or widespread. Types of widespread psoriasis include guttate, generalised pustular, and erythrodermic (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2007</LINK>). Chronic plaque psoriasis may be localised or widespread and accounts for 90% of psoriasis cases (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2007</LINK>); it is characterised by red patches of thickened skin (plaques) covered in silver scales (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Any area of the body may be affected, but the main areas are the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp. There is a wide spectrum of disease severity from a single plaque to involvement of more than 90% of the skin surface. Psoriasis may be classified as 'mild', 'moderate', or 'severe', although these categories are difficult to define precisely (<LINK REF="REF-Krueger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krueger 2000</LINK>). Psoriatic arthritis accompanies the cutaneous (skin) manifestations of psoriasis in 5% to 30% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Barisic_x002d_Drusko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barisic-Drusko 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krueger-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krueger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salvarani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvarani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanolli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanolli 1992</LINK>). Recent improvements in the classification criteria may reduce the wide variation in reported prevalence of psoriatic arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2006</LINK>). Psoriasis occurs in 5% of people with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1990</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>The way that psoriasis develops is complicated and appears to be influenced by many factors, including genetic changes, local trauma, infections, certain drugs (such as beta-blockers, lithium, chloroquine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), the duration of antipsoriatic treatments, endocrine factors, sunlight, alcohol, smoking, and stress (<LINK REF="REF-Tagami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tagami 1997</LINK>). The skin lesions of psoriasis are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, and they are characterised by cells multiplying too quickly (epidermal hyperproliferation), cells not maturing normally (abnormal keratinocyte differentiation), and the presence of cells that cause inflammation (a lymphocyte inflammatory infiltrate) (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stern-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1997</LINK>). Psoriasis is now recognised as an immune-mediated disorder, with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;), dendritic cells, and T-cells all contributing to its pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2007a</LINK>). Several genes interact with environmental factors to induce the development of psoriasis, and different combinations of changes in several genes and environmental factors can produce the same clinical picture of psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Bhalerao-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhalerao 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brandrup-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandrup 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farber-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farber 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lomholt-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lomholt 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willan-1808" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willan 1808</LINK>). A locus (plural = loci) is the specific location of a gene on a chromosome, and its position is defined using the letters 'p' (for a chromosome's short arm) and 'q' (for a long arm). At least nine chromosomal psoriasis susceptibility loci were originally identified (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2007a</LINK>). The strongest association and linkage is to a locus within the major histocompatibility complex, the area affecting immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Genetic-Analysis-of-Psoriasis-Consortium-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genetic Analysis of Psoriasis Consortium 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henseler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henseler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svejgaard-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svejgaard 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tazi_x002d_Ahnini-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tazi-Ahnini 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tazi_x002d_Ahnini-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tazi-Ahnini 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trembath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trembath 1997</LINK>). Other linkage studies have reported linkage to 4q and 17q (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomfohrde-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomfohrde 1994</LINK>) and 16q and 20q (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trembath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trembath 1997</LINK>). Proinflammatory CD4-positive T helper cells produce interferon gamma (produced by Th1) or interleukin (IL)-17 (produced by Th17). These cells interact with dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils, causing inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Ghoreschi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghoreschi 2007</LINK>). A meta-analysis of 3 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has identified 15 new susceptibility loci (<LINK REF="REF-Tsoi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsoi 2012</LINK>) for psoriasis. This brings the total number of loci associated with psoriasis to 36. Several of these loci are involved in the regulation of the skin's innate immune response. They provide confirmation of the role of several existing biologic therapies as well as new targets for drug development. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Until identified as a single disease by von Hebra in 1841, psoriasis was thought to be a variant of leprosy and regarded as contagious (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 1997</LINK>). The misconception may persist: In a survey of people with psoriasis in 1997, almost three-quarters of respondents reported that others thought their condition was contagious, and a similar proportion feared swimming and taking part in sporting activities (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1998</LINK>). Psoriasis can lead to social isolation (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 1997a</LINK>), stigmatisation (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 1997a</LINK>), and fear of other people's reactions, adversely affecting the quality of daily life (<LINK REF="REF-Finlay-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finlay-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finlay-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finlay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKenna-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortonne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortonne 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stern-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1995</LINK>).

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-25 17:36:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Treatment of psoriasis should always be appropriate to its severity and importance to that individual: It should never be more unpleasant, intolerable, or dangerous than the disease itself (<LINK REF="REF-Camp-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camp 1992</LINK>). Topical treatments include vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids (<LINK REF="STD-Baadsgaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baadsgaard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fredriksson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredriksson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goeckerman-1931" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goeckerman 1931</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingram-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingram 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kragballe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kragballe 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Staberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unna-1916" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unna 1916</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 1996a</LINK>), but there is no evidence-based 'treatment ladder' by which to sequence treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Kerkhof-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Kerkhof 2008</LINK>). Emollients are generally used in a supportive role as an addition to topical treatments, to normalise hyperproliferation, differentiation, and to exert anti-inflammatory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Fluhr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fluhr 2008</LINK>). The two classes of topical treatment for psoriasis that are most commonly prescribed in developed countries are vitamin D analogues and topical corticosteroids, because they are considered more cosmetically acceptable than tar and dithranol preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Baadsgaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baadsgaard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kragballe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kragballe 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 1996a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Topical corticosteroids (specifically glucocorticoids) are available in four potencies: mild, moderate, potent, and very potent, which are assessed using the vasoconstrictor assay (<LINK REF="REF-BMA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMA 2012</LINK>). The benefit of topical steroids is that in cream formulations, they are easy to apply, cosmetically acceptable, do not stain the skin, and rarely cause irritation. There are several adverse effects of corticosteroids, including cutaneous atrophy, rebound after discontinuation of treatment, and decreasing response to the drug (tachyphylaxis) (<LINK REF="REF-du-Vivier-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Vivier 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 2003</LINK>). Glucocorticoids (GC) exert their effects either via interaction with cell membranes (non-genomic effects) or downstream with the genome and via interaction with intracellular fluid in GC receptors and downstream with the genome (genomic effects). The genomic effects are of two types: "transrepression (inhibition of synthesis of regulatory proteins) and transactivation (induction of the synthesis of regulatory proteins)" (<LINK REF="REF-Bos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2008</LINK>). Transactivation appears to mediate certain adverse reactions, such as cutaneous atrophy. Immunomodulation seems to be the result of GC-mediated transrepression, that is, silencing of proinflammatory genes, such as TNF&#945;. Non-steroidal GC receptor ligands (selective GC receptor agonists) have recently been identified and may reduce the side-effects of GC without loss of immunosuppressive effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The naturally occurring active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol (1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) (<LINK REF="REF-Langner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langner 1996</LINK>), and two synthetic vitamin D analogues, calcipotriol (<LINK REF="REF-Kragballe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kragballe 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Staberg 1989</LINK>) and tacalcitol (1a,24-dihydroxyvitamin D3) (<LINK REF="STD-Baadsgaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baadsgaard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 1996a</LINK>), are effective when applied topically in psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002a</LINK>). These agents bind to vitamin D receptors (VDR), which in turn bind to vitamin D-responsive elements (VDRE) in multiple genes. 'Switching on' (transactivation of) these genes inhibits the multiplication of cells and stimulates their differentiation (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). VDRs also suppress the inflammatory component of psoriasis by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (small proteins that affect cell-cell interaction), such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). Vitamin D analogues all have the potential to induce abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood serum (hypercalcaemia) and urine (hypercalciuria). Although calcipotriol ointment causes no elevation of total serum calcium when used at the recommended dose of 100 g per week (<LINK REF="REF-Mortensen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortensen 1993</LINK>), there are significant elevations in both serum and urinary calcium when the dose is increased to 300 g per week (<LINK REF="REF-Bourke-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourke 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourke-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourke 1994</LINK>). Topical vitamin D analogues are cosmetically acceptable; they are not known to cause skin atrophy; and they are not usually associated with rebound when therapy is discontinued. However, at least 25% of people are reported to have little or no response to topical vitamin D analogues (<LINK REF="REF-Holick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mee-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mee 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Urea or salicylic acid may be used to reduce thickness and scaling of the skin; combination with other products can improve their absorption. However, these can also irritate the skin. Topical immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, and topical macrolactams, such as tacrolimus, are relatively new treatments, and their effectiveness, tolerability, and longer-term effects are less clear than with the more established products. This review also considers combination products involving any of the above treatments.</P>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Library</I> has three published Cochrane reviews of interventions for psoriasis. <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2000</LINK> assessed the impact of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis. The review found that "although both antibiotics and tonsillectomy have frequently been advocated for patients with recurrent guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis, there is to date no good evidence that either intervention is beneficial." <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2000</LINK> reviewed all treatments, excluding antistreptococcal interventions, for guttate psoriasis. The review identified only one relevant trial and no evidence of the effectiveness of any topical interventions. <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2006</LINK> assessed interventions, including topical treatments, for chronic palmoplantar pustulosis (a disease that is closely related to psoriasis and used to be considered a variant of psoriasis). <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2006</LINK> found that topical steroids under hydrocolloid occlusion were effective in inducing remission. In addition, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>has four published Cochrane review protocols, which cover interventions for nail psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Velema-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velema 2009</LINK>), interventions for scalp psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Jales-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jales 2012</LINK>), phototherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>), and the biological agent ustekinumab (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Chronic plaque psoriasis is a condition for which there is no known cure, and currently, available treatments may only temporarily clear the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Bonifati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonifati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2004</LINK>). Clinical practice varies between and within different countries. By focusing on topical treatments for psoriasis, either as monotherapy or in combination, this review assesses the relative effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of these treatments and so helps to determine how best to induce remission and delay recurrence in people receiving topical treatment. <LINK REF="TBL-20" TYPE="TABLE">Table 20</LINK> provides a list of acronyms used in the review.</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials in the review. Trials could be either placebo-controlled or head-to-head with a vitamin D preparation (head-to-head trials compare two active treatments with each other). The types of study design eligible for inclusion were as follows: parallel-group (between-patient), cross-over, and within-patient designs. For within-patient studies, where study participants serve as their own control, we included only those studies that clearly adopted a left-right design, and we excluded studies where multiple plaques were treated with more than two products. If no useful effectiveness, withdrawal, or adverse events data were available, either from the published paper or from sponsors or trialists, we excluded the study.</P>
<P>In addition to findings on adverse events from the main review, we undertook separate searches for additional safety and tolerability studies. The searches for longer-term adverse events included studies of any design that included humans (i.e. not only animals; either humans only or humans and animals). However, studies with fewer than 10 participants (including case reports) were not eligible for inclusion. We did not restrict the search for concordance/adherence studies by study design (i.e. non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion).</P>

</UL>
<P>We compared topical treatments with vehicle (placebo). We also compared vitamin D analogues with other topical treatments. We selected vitamin D analogues for this comparison because they are first-line treatments in many developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 1998</LINK>). We based the potency of topical corticosteroids on classifications from a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review included any topical treatment for psoriasis, except for products for which (a) no licence was obtained and (b) research into the product was discontinued. The reason for this exclusion criterion is that these products are unlikely to be of interest to people making decisions about health care, such as policy-makers, people with psoriasis, or clinicians. Although they may be of interest to researchers, lessons from the research into 'failed' molecules are likely to have been reflected in the development of subsequent products.</P>

<P>Two authors (AM and JM) screened titles and (where available) abstracts identified from the searches, and another author (MC) acted as an arbiter when necessary. In our protocol, we stated our intention that we would exclude studies meeting only some of the inclusion criteria stated above. However, this was infeasible, because we would have needed to cite large numbers of studies (over 1000). Therefore, we listed as excluded only those studies that we deemed potentially eligible for inclusion <I>and</I> for which we retrieved full papers, but which subsequently failed to meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>For the separate search for studies exploring adverse events, we deemed studies as eligible if they addressed safety or tolerability issues, focused on drugs included in the main review, and were longer-term in follow-up (&gt; 12 weeks). Short-term studies (with follow-up &lt; 12 weeks) were eligible for inclusion only if they were designed specifically to consider adverse effects, tolerability, or safety. Studies that included fewer than 10 participants (including case reports) were not eligible for inclusion.</P>

<P>For each outcome measure under a comparison, we included the same treatment options regardless of data availability (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summarising primary outcomes with standardised mean differences</HEADING>
<P>We extracted data on four primary outcome measures:</P>
<UL>
<LI>IAGI (Investigator's Assessment of Global Improvement) or the IGA (Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity)</LI>
<LI>TSS (Total Severity Score)</LI>
<LI>PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index)</LI>
<LI>PAGI (Patient Assessment of Global Improvement) or the PGA (Patient Global Assessment of Disease Severity)</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials often reported more than one measure, but none of the trials reported all measures. We therefore devised a 'combined end point', which allowed more data to contribute to an overall analysis and facilitated treatment comparisons. We labelled this 'super' outcome as outcome (e) throughout the review.</P>
<P>We constructed the combined end point by taking IAGI (or IGA) data when available, and failing this, TSS, PASI, or PAGI (PGA) data in that order of availability. For PASI and TSS, some included trials reported change scores and others reported end point scores. In view of the mix of end point/change scores and of the variation in scale, we analysed findings using a standardised mean difference statistic (SMD) in a random-effects model. <LINK REF="TBL-26" TYPE="TABLE">Table 26</LINK> summarises the characteristics of the outcome measures.</P>
<P>We also expressed SMDs in physical units adjusting by the appropriate pooled standard deviation estimate (<LINK REF="TBL-27" TYPE="TABLE">Table 27</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We summarised data on adverse events, quality of life measures, economic outcomes, and concordance as narratives. We summarised withdrawal data using the risk difference (RD) metric and pooled using a random-effects model. We felt this was more appropriate than a fixed-effect model since definitions of withdrawal and adverse events vary between trials.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-02-25 14:19:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Within-patient studies are statistically analogous to cross-over studies, and results should be adjusted by the correlation coefficient (Section 16.4.6, <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). No study included in the review reported this statistic, and we did not have access to patient-level data, so could not estimate it directly. </P>
<P>On the subject of cross-over studies, the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> states (Section 16.4.5; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) the following: "A common situation is that means and standard deviations (or standard errors) are available only for measurements on E [experimental group] and C [control group] separately. A simple approach to incorporating cross-over trials in a meta-analysis is thus to take all measurements from intervention E periods and all measurements from intervention C periods and analyse these as if the trial were a parallel-group trial of E versus C. This approach gives rise to a unit-of-analysis error (see Chapter 9, Section 9.3) and should be avoided unless it can be demonstrated that the results approximate those from a paired analysis, as described in Section 16.4.4. The reason for this is that confidence intervals are likely to be too wide, and the trial will receive too little weight, with the possible consequence of disguising clinically important heterogeneity. Nevertheless, this incorrect analysis is conservative, in that studies are under-weighted rather than over-weighted. While some argue against the inclusion of cross-over trials in this way, the unit-of-analysis error might be regarded as less serious than some other types of unit-of-analysis error."</P>
<P>Consequently, we included within-patient studies as though they were parallel-group studies, accepting that they are under-weighted. To explore whether it was appropriate to combine these trials, we undertook two sensitivity analyses. First, we considered how effect size varied for within- and between-patient studies. If the magnitude of effect varied consistently between the two study designs, this strongly suggested a non-zero correlation coefficient and an appropriateness to separate the trials. Second, we used sensitivity analysis to explore the impact on pooled findings of varying the correlation coefficient (rho) for within-patient studies. This analysis used the generic inverse variance measure, with SMDs and their standard errors estimated from the formulae in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (Section 16.4.6.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). These estimated SMDs differ slightly from those that RevMan estimates for continuous outcomes, even when the correlation coefficient is zero (which is the assumption implicit in the latter model). </P>
<P>The analyses found no evidence that the magnitude of effect varied consistently. Within-patient trials did not consistently demonstrate smaller or larger effects than between-patient trials. Varying the value of rho had no significant effect on the findings: As rho increased, the effect size increased and the confidence intervals (usually) widened, but the magnitudes of changes were small and non-significant at the 5% level.</P>
<P>In the interests of statistical purity, these trials could (a) be reported separately or (b) be removed altogether.  The drawback of option (a) is that it makes an already complex review even more complex and less accessible; the disadvantage of option (b) is that it removes data that might be of interest to clinicians and people with psoriasis. On balance, we preferred to report relevant randomised data wherever possible to help inform pragmatic decision-making.</P>

<P>We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data.</P>
<P>Where studies did not report estimates of variance, we derived them from confidence intervals (CIs) or from P values where possible.

<P>We analysed findings using a standardised mean difference statistic (SMD) in a random-effects model. However, this model cannot perfectly address all the sources of design complexity that arise when summarising findings across studies. Three of the main sources of complexity are listed below. Other sources of complexity include variation in trial duration, disease severity, participant demographics, treatment application method, dosing frequency, drug potency and vehicle.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design (within- versus between-patient)</HEADING>
<P>Trials were either between-patient or within-patient designs. The former randomise participants into separate (parallel) groups; the latter randomise treatments to the left or right side of the same participant. Within- and between-patient trials have different variance structures. Moreover, the two responses (left and right) of within-patient studies may be correlated (See <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK> for further details).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Absence of a simple one-to-one correspondence between papers, trials, and comparisons</HEADING>
<P>There were instances of single papers reporting either multiple trials or multiple analyses within a single trial. Therefore, simple counts of numbers of participants and numbers of studies contributing data to the analysis were misleading, and we made adjustments accordingly (<LINK REF="TBL-25" TYPE="TABLE">Table 25</LINK>). Thus, these numbers may not match the numbers estimated in RevMan, which does not account for these factors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Body area targeted for treatment</HEADING>
<P>Whereas the majority of trials investigated chronic plaque psoriasis on the body, some trials focused on scalp psoriasis; some reported findings for both scalp and body psoriasis; and some were of inverse (flexural) or facial psoriasis. One trial of body and scalp psoriasis reported overall outcomes (IAGI/PAGI), a scalp-only outcome (TSS), and a body-only outcome (modified PASI) (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2002a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2010</LINK> reported findings separately for treatment of the body and treatment of the face. We previously used sensitivity analysis to investigate the scalp psoriasis trials (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2009</LINK>), but in this update we analysed trials of inverse psoriasis (comparisons 16 and 17) and scalp trials (comparisons 18 and 19) separately from the trials of body psoriasis (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>).</P>

<P>We examined findings by agent class (as our primary analysis) and individual topical agent (within-class analysis).</P>
<P>When comparing trials both within and across therapeutic classes, the summary estimates may demonstrate substantial heterogeneity. Ideally, we would seek to identify the reasons for individual differences, but publications rarely report sufficient detail to make a robust investigation feasible. Reasons might include differences in trial design, length of follow-up, disease severity, participant selection, adherence, adequacy of concealment of allocation, adequacy of blinding, and source of funding (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002a</LINK>). </P>
<P>The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> explicitly endorses the combination of 'apples and oranges' "if they are used to contribute to a wider question about fruit" (Section 9.5.1; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Our purpose was to identify whether classes of topical treatments work and are safe. To this end, there is a fundamental difference between heterogeneity that makes it uncertain whether individual people with psoriasis will derive any benefit from a treatment and heterogeneity that makes the size of a positive benefit imprecise. Clinicians and those with psoriasis will still value information about a treatment that is beneficial even though its magnitude is poorly understood. However, we clearly stated the presence of heterogeneity where it occurred and used the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> as a guide to interpretation (Section 8.5.2; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).  </P>

<P>We used a meta-analysis with a random-effects estimation both for measures of effect and for pooling of risk differences for adverse events. We quantified heterogeneity using the I² statistic. If we identified outliers, we undertook a sensitivity analysis to investigate the implications of their exclusion on the pooled summary statistics. In addition, we undertook sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of within-patient versus between-patient trials, and to explore the impact on pooled findings of varying the correlation coefficient (see <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK>). In some comparisons, there were no, or relatively few, studies that included both within-patient and between-patient designs, few participants contributing data, or both. We used the following criteria to help decide whether we should have included an analysis in the sensitivity analysis:</P>
<UL>
<LI>frequently-used products in clinical practice; and</LI>
<LI>for within-/between-patient sensitivity analysis: whether it included both within-patient and between-patient designs</LI>
</UL>
<P>Where at least two within-patient trials were included in a pooled comparison, we explored the potential influence of the correlation coefficient.</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, we selected six comparisons (analyses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 18) for sensitivity analysis. To ensure sufficient data were available, we analysed the combined end points. These analyses cover vitamin D analogues, dithranol, and corticosteroids, which are amongst the most frequently used products in clinical practice.</P>

<P>From the 2011 searches, we retrieved 148 papers and screened these for eligibility. (Some papers were multiple reports of the same trial).</P>

<P>We included 48 new randomised controlled trials in the updated review. Compared with the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2009</LINK>), studies were larger (mean number of participants: 284 versus 164), had a longer treatment duration (10 weeks versus 6 weeks) and follow up (11 weeks versus 8 weeks), and were more likely to be parallel-group in design (88% versus 63%). The new studies were also more likely to include an active control group (60% versus 43%) and patient-reported outcomes (44% versus 24%), and there were relatively more scalp trials (21% versus 12%). The 48 trials provided evidence on 7 new active treatments.  </P>

<P>The updated review included 177 studies, with 34,808 participants.</P>
<P>The number of included studies counted by RevMan is 190, because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table as two studies.</P>
<P>Of the included studies, 106 of these were placebo-controlled; 84 compared treatments head-to-head, with 15 trials reporting both placebo-controlled and head-to-head comparisons. The 15 trials reporting both head-to-head and placebo comparisons contributed only once to the analysis of study characteristics, unless the trial involved entirely distinct participants in its placebo-controlled and active-controlled analyses.

This study contributed only once to the analysis of study characteristics (number of participants, proportion of males, etc).

One trial evaluated psoriasis in children (<LINK REF="STD-Oranje-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oranje 1997</LINK>). Most trials were conducted in ambulatory care settings, but four trials were of hospitalised participants (<LINK REF="STD-Grattan-1997-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Grattan 1997 (H) </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Grattan-1997-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Grattan 1997 (P)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monastirli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Monastirli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Vleuten-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Vleuten 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>One hundred and twenty-three trials adopted a between-patient (parallel-group) design; 53 were within-patient studies; and one trial used both designs (<LINK REF="STD-Henneicke_x002d_v.-Z.-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henneicke-v. Z. 1993</LINK>). The trial by Levine (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-2010-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2010 (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Levine-2010-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2010 (P)</LINK>) was a within-patient trial that randomised participants to two of seven treatment options. Therefore, the pair-wise comparisons we analysed (e.g. calcipotriol versus placebo) included a mixture of within- and between-patient designs: Some participants received calcipotriol on one side and placebo on the other; other participants received calcipotriol on one side and another active treatment on the other side.</P>
<P>The 177 studies included 34,808 participants. Of these studies, 133 provided data on the age of participants. The mean age of all participants for which studies provided data was 47.2 years (range = 2 to 97 years) (N = 28,921). Data on the gender of participants (N = 28,941) were available from 140 studies. Overall, participants were more likely to be male; the mean proportion of males was 56.7% (range = 30% to 100%).</P>
<P>Almost half the studies (77/177 = 44%) did not clearly report the overall baseline severity of study participants (e.g. participants with mild to moderate disease) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). One hundred studies explicitly reported baseline severity or reported sufficient information on global severity scores, such as the mean and variation in baseline PASI or the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected, to allow us to infer global severity using guidance on the interpretation of severity scores (<LINK REF="REF-Finlay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krueger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krueger 2000</LINK>). In the 100 trials where severity was assessable, we classified participant severity as mild (5 studies), mild to moderate (36 studies), mild to severe (6) or very severe (2 studies), moderate (12 studies), moderate to severe (27 studies), moderately severe (2 studies), moderately severe to very severe (2 studies), and severe (8 studies).</P>
<P>Seventy-seven studies provided insufficient information to allow an assessment of clinical severity to be made; we could not make assessments of the clinical characteristics of participants in studies reporting only the mean PASI (with no information about variation) or reporting only localised (e.g. TSS) scores. One example of a study that included participants with a wide range of severity scores is the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1992</LINK>, where the mean baseline PASI was 9.0 (suggesting moderately severe disease, according to <LINK REF="REF-Finlay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 2005</LINK>), but where individual participant scores ranged from 0.6 to 41.2. Another example is the study by <LINK REF="STD-Olsen-1996-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 1996 (1)</LINK>, where participant BSA involvement averaged 12%, but ranged from 1% to 80%. It is unclear how participant severity was distributed within these ranges (i.e. whether these extremes were 'outliers' or whether a sizeable proportion of participants were clustered at the extreme ends of the distribution).</P>
<P>Even where trialists classified participant severity, it was not always clear that this was consistent with published guidance, which itself does not always provide consistent messages. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Finlay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 2005</LINK> states that a PASI score &gt; 10, a BSA involvement &gt; 10%, or Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score &gt; 10 constitutes severe disease. However, <LINK REF="REF-Krueger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krueger 2000</LINK> argues that BSA is unreliable as an indicator of severity, which is better proxied by quality of life assessments. However, the included studies rarely assessed quality of life. Given this lack of clarity and the absence of adequate severity data in around half (44%) of the included studies, we could not use sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of baseline participant severity, nor could we reliably use severity to investigate inter-study heterogeneity.</P>
<P>All 177 studies provided data on treatment duration (mean: 7 weeks; range = 1 to 52) and follow-up duration (mean: 9 weeks; range = 2 to 52), where 'follow-up duration' was defined as including the treatment period. Commonly used outcomes assessed by the studies included the following:</P>

<P>We grouped placebo-controlled trials by type of treatment (e.g. vitamin D products) and grouped head-to-head trials in a similar way (e.g. vitamin D versus potent corticosteroid). We included 19 comparisons in the review. Since many trials did not specify participants' disease severity, it was not possible to use severity to inform pooling decisions. The primary analysis explored the results of pooling within these 19 comparison groups using a random-effects model. In addition, we undertook sensitivity analyses for five comparisons using the 'combined end point'. These analyses used pooled data to explore within- and between-patient trial variation.</P>
<P>In 90% (159/177) of the studies included in the review, participants applied their own treatments. Nurses applied treatments in 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Geilen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geilen 2000</LINK>); participants' parents delivered some care in a trial of childhood psoriasis (<LINK REF="STD-Oranje-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oranje 1997</LINK>); and the delivery method was unclear in 16 studies.</P>

<P>Of the 177 studies assessed for quality, 15 (8.5%) explicitly achieved adequate concealment of treatment allocation (low risk of bias). Concealment was unclear in the majority of studies (160 studies = 90.4%), so the risk of bias was also unclear.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Method of generation of the randomisation sequence</HEADING>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. However, 130 studies (73%) did not clearly report the randomisation method used. Fourteen studies reported a block randomisation design, and 27 studies used computerised methods (5 studies used both). Four reported that sequential allocation had been used (3 of these studies were published in the 1970s); 1 study used the toss of a coin; and another study used a sealed envelope method. It could be argued that we should have excluded trials with sequential allocation from the review, but this might discriminate against studies with better reporting methods in favour of those not stating the randomisation method.</P>

Studies could demonstrate comparability by reporting data for each group, by reporting the outcome of statistical tests (e.g. P values), or both. One hundred and sixteen studies (65.5%) demonstrated that the groups were comparable at baseline; 27 studies (15.3%) demonstrated partial comparability; and 34 studies (19.2%) did not clearly demonstrate comparability between the groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The review analyses 19 comparisons. Of these, 8 are topical treatment versus placebo analyses, and 11 are head-to-head analyses of a topical treatment against a vitamin D analogue (i.e. 1 commonly used class of treatments). Some analyses are a 'catch all' category; for example, analysis 6 includes 'Other treatment versus placebo', which covers 26 treatments for body psoriasis for which there is less research evidence (both in terms of numbers of studies and numbers of participants contributing data). Similarly, analysis 15 incorporates 12 head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D analogues for body psoriasis that are not easily classified under the other head-to-head comparisons. Scalp trials (comparisons 18 and 19) and trials of inverse psoriasis (comparisons 16 and 17) are analysed separately from the trials of body psoriasis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-25" TYPE="TABLE">Table 25</LINK> summarises the 19 analyses. <LINK REF="TBL-26" TYPE="TABLE">Table 26</LINK> gives details of the outcome measures considered. The number of participants and number of studies are adjusted manually from those reported in the Tables and Figures to allow for within-patient studies, studies contributing more than once to a single analysis, and studies contributing to multiple analyses. Therefore, numbers of participants and studies reported sometimes differ from the numbers estimated by RevMan.</P>
<P>For each of the 19 analyses, we analysed data on 5 effectiveness outcome measures, where available. The fifth measure is a 'combined end point' that uses data from the four primary outcome measures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 1: Vitamin D analogues versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included eight vitamin D analogues for body psoriasis (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Twenty trials with 3771 participants reported IAGI data on 7 of these treatments. Thirteen trials were between-patient design, and 7 were within-patient studies. Treatment duration ranged from 4 weeks to 12 weeks. The pooled SMD across all treatments was -0.95 (95% CI -1.17 to -0.74; I² statistic = 89.0%), but there was considerable variation between treatments, so we removed pooling across subgroups. Six treatments were significantly more effective than placebo, with the effect size ranging from -0.67 (becocalcidiol twice daily) to -1.66 (paricalcitol once daily). There was considerable between-study variation in the IAGI SMD for calcitriol. The pooled effect was -1.03 (95% CI -1.71 to -0.36), but this ranged from -0.26 (95% CI -0.99 to 0.47) for <LINK REF="STD-Langner-2001-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Langner 2001 (P)</LINK> to -3.11 (95% CI -3.57 to -2.66) for <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1996</LINK>. The magnitude of the IAGI SMD for the Perez study was the highest across all comparisons and treatments. For the 'combined end point' of this analysis, we explored the impact of removing this trial from the pooled findings using sensitivity analysis. The presence of considerable heterogeneity within this subgroup means that the estimated average benefit should be interpreted with caution (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

Nine studies with 1867 participants reported IAGI data on 6 of these 10 treatments. Eight trials were between-patient design, and one was a within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2001</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from 3 to 12 weeks.

Five studies with 515 participants reported IAGI data on 2 of the 3 treatments. There were four between-patient trials and 1 within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Beutner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beutner 2006</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from two to four weeks. The IAGI SMD across both treatments was -1.87 (95% CI -2.38 to -1.36; I² statistic = 78.7%). Both clobetasol propionate and halobetasol performed statistically significantly better than placebo.

Five parallel-group studies with 2058 participants contributed data on both dosing options. Treatment duration ranged from four to eight weeks. The IAGI SMD across treatments was -1.44 (95% CI -1.76 to -1.12; I² statistic = 89.4%), with twice-daily combination treatment (SMD -1.90; 95% CI -2.09 to -1.71) achieving a significantly larger effect than once-daily treatment (SMD -1.21; 95% CI -1.50 to -0.91). However, the difference between once- and twice-daily dosing was not statistically significant when benefit was assessed using the PASI (see <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>). In <LINK REF="CMP-018.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 18.1</LINK>, we report placebo-controlled trials of combination vitamin D/steroid treatments for scalp psoriasis.</P>

<P>In total, we included 26 treatments in this analysis (see <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Eight studies with 364 participants reported IAGI data on 8 of these 26 treatments. Four trials were between-patient design, and four were within-patient studies. Treatment duration ranged from 3 to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Four treatments performed statistically significantly better than placebo: anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody cream; betamethasone 17-valerate 21-acetate plus tretinoin plus salicylic acid, indigo naturalise 1.4% ointment, and methotrexate gel. The effect size for the IAGI ranged from -0.56 (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2001</LINK>; methotrexate gel) to -2.14 (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; indigo naturalise 1.4% ointment).</P>
<P>In four treatments, the difference relative to placebo was not statistically significant: hexafluoro-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, kukui nut oil, oleum horwathiensis, and platelet aggregation activating factor (PAF). No treatment was statistically significantly less effective than placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 7: Vitamin D analogues versus corticosteroid (potent)</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included eight vitamin D analogue-potent corticosteroid contrasts for body psoriasis (see <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). Eight studies with 2655 participants reported IAGI data for 6 of the 8 intervention-comparator contrasts (see <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). Seven trials were between-patient design, and one was a within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Medansky-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Medansky 1996</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from three to eight weeks. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between vitamin D analogues and potent corticosteroids: The SMD across all 6 treatments for IAGI was 0.17 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.37; I² statistic = 83.4%). In light of the high level of heterogeneity and inconsistency across treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We removed pooling. Vitamin D analogues performed statistically significantly better than one potent corticosteroid. This finding came from a single between-patient study in which 99 participants contributed data (<LINK REF="STD-Bruce-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bruce 1994</LINK>). The SMD for calcipotriol against fluocinonide 0.05% ointment was -0.58 (95% CI -0.99 to -0.18; I² statistic = NA). Calcipotriol was statistically significantly less effective than both diflorasone diacetate 0.05% ointment (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.52) and betamethasone dipropionate (SMD 0.43; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.58; I² statistic = 50.3%). We found no statistically significant difference between calcipotriol and betamethasone valerate, calcitriol and betamethasone dipropionate, or calcitriol and betamethasone valerate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 8: Vitamin D analogues versus corticosteroid (very potent)</HEADING>

One study with 42 participants reported IAGI data. <LINK REF="STD-Koo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Koo 2006</LINK> was a between-patient study with a treatment duration of two weeks, which found no significant difference between the treatments (SMD 0.19; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.80).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 9: Vitamin D combined with corticosteroid versus corticosteroid</HEADING>
<P>This comparison considered vitamin D analogues-steroid combination against potent or very potent corticosteroids for body psoriasis (see <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). The comparison included three contrasts: calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate versus betamethasone dipropionate, calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate versus clobetasol propionate, and calcipotriol plus clobetasol propionate versus clobetasol propionate.</P>
<P>Four between-patient trials reported IAGI data for 1991 participants on 2 of the 3 intervention-comparator contrasts. Treatment duration ranged between two and eight weeks. As these treatment comparisons were very different, we only pooled subtotals. In all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2010-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2010 (H)</LINK>), combination treatment was significantly more effective than corticosteroid alone. Three of the four trials compared calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate against betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -0.40; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.27; I² statistic = 41.8%), and one trial compared combined treatment with calcipotriol and clobetasol against clobetasol alone (SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.15).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 10: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus dithranol</HEADING>
<P>This comparison considered vitamin D analogues against dithranol (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). We identified three intervention-comparator contrasts: calcipotriol versus dithranol, calcitriol versus dithranol, and tacalcitol versus dithranol. Five between-patient trials reported IAGI data for 1108 participants on 2 of these 3 intervention-comparator contrasts. Treatment duration ranged from 8 weeks to 12 weeks. There was some variation in the dithranol regimens employed by trials and in the baseline severity of trial participants. These factors may help explain the high level of heterogeneity found in the pooled results.</P>
<P>The SMD for the IAGI was -0.24 (95% CI -0.72 to 0.25; I² statistic = 93.0%). The presence of considerable heterogeneity means that the estimated average benefit should be treated with caution and pooling was therefore removed (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Data from four trials contributed to the SMD for the calcipotriol versus dithranol: -0.43 (95% CI -0.85 to -0.01; I² statistic = 89.3%), indicating that calcipotriol was statistically significantly more effective than dithranol. Three of these four trials found a significant difference in favour of calcipotriol (<LINK REF="STD-Berth-Jones-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Berth Jones 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 1998</LINK>), but the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2006</LINK> found outpatient treatment with short contact dithranol to be significantly more effective than calcipotriol alone.</P>
<P>Data from one trial contributed to the SMD for the calcitriol versus dithranol: 0.51 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; I² statistic = NA), indicating that dithranol was statistically significantly more effective than calcitriol.</P>

Three trials involving 498 participants contributed IAGI data for all 3 intervention-comparator contrasts (one trial for each contrast). Two trials were between-patient, and one was within-patient in design (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1999-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1999 (H)</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from 8 to 12 weeks. The SMD for the IAGI was -0.06 (95% CI -0.51 to 0.38; I² statistic = 82.2%). The presence of substantial heterogeneity reflects differences in the findings from the two intervention-comparator contrasts underlying this statistic. We found a statistically significant difference in favour of calcipotriol in the analysis against tacalcitol (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.21), but there was no significant difference relative to calcitriol (SMD 0.00; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.25) or between calcipotriol and maxacalcitol (SMD 0.43; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.98).

Eleven parallel-group trials involving 4791 participants contributed IAGI data for 9 of these 12 intervention-comparator contrasts. Treatment duration ranged from two to eight weeks.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 13: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other treatments: complex regimens</HEADING>
<P>This comparison summarises findings on complex regimens for body psoriasis, defined here as treatment sequences that do not consist of a simple head-to-head comparison between two active treatments (see <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>). We identified 12 intervention-comparator contrasts, and IAGI data were available for 10 of these. Data from 2755 participants contributed to the IAGI analysis, based on findings from seven trials. Six of the trials were between-patient (parallel-group) in design, and one was a within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Austad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Austad 1998</LINK>). Trial duration varied between 6 and 12 weeks. As the interventions and comparators were highly variable and because two trials each contributed three pair-wise contrasts, we did not pool the data.</P>
<P>Six intervention-comparator contrasts for which IAGI data were available found a significant difference between regimens. A two-week regimen with clobetasol propionate followed by four weeks' treatment with calcipotriol was more effective than six weeks of monotherapy with calcipotriol (SMD 0.60; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.02). All treatments were applied twice-daily in this within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Austad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Austad 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining five more effective regimens all involved once-daily treatment with a combined product containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, and the same study (<LINK REF="STD-White-2006-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">White 2006 (P)</LINK>) reported three contrasts. This study involved an initial 'treatment' phase consisting of 4 weeks' treatment with the combined product, followed by an 8-week maintenance phase. In one maintenance phase, participants received placebo ointment for 8 weeks. This was significantly less effective than maintenance with once-daily calcipotriol (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41), and it was also less effective than maintenance with once-daily calcipotriol on weekdays and the combined product at the weekend (SMD 0.51; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66). When these two comparator regimens were compared directly (<LINK REF="STD-White-2006-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">White 2006 (H)</LINK>), the alternating regimen using weekday/weekend treatments during the maintenance phase was significantly more effective than once-daily calcipotriol for maintenance (SMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40). <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2004</LINK> compared 3 12-week treatment regimens, 2 of which were 'complex'. When we compared these complex regimens, eight weeks' once-daily combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, followed by four weeks of once-daily calcipotriol was significantly less effective than a regimen consisting of four weeks' once-daily combination treatment, followed by eight weeks of once-daily calcipotriol on weekdays and the combined product at weekends (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40). A separate trial compared 8 weeks with tacalcitol to combination ointment for 4 weeks, followed by calcipotriol for 4 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2004</LINK>). Participants applied all treatments once daily (at night time). Monotherapy with tacalcitol was significantly less effective than the complex regimen (SMD 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72).</P>
<P>In 4 of the 10 intervention-comparator contrasts for which IAGI data were available, there was no significant difference in effect. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2004</LINK> (see paragraph above) found no difference between twice-daily calcipotriol and the two comparator complex regimens. One regimen consisted of eight weeks' once-daily treatment with a combined product containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, followed by four weeks of once-daily calcipotriol. Relative to calcipotriol monotherapy, the SMD for the IAGI was -0.12 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.04). When compared with a regimen consisting of four weeks' once-daily treatment with a combined product containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, followed by eight weeks of once-daily calcipotriol on weekdays and the combined product at weekends, twice-daily calcipotriol appeared to be slightly less effective, although the difference was not statistically significant (SMD 0.13; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.29).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK> compared a six-week course of twice-daily calcipotriol with a complex routine using halometasone and calcipotriol. For two weeks participants applied halometasone in the morning and calcipotriol at night; over the next two weeks, halometasone was applied twice daily at weekends and calcipotriol twice daily during the week. For the final two weeks, treatment reverted to twice-daily calcipotriol. Although there was a trend in favour of the complex regimen (SMD 0.41; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.86), the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lahfa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lahfa 2003</LINK> compared two different vitamin D products combined with a very potent corticosteroid. In the initial phase, participants applied dual therapy (clobetasol propionate in the mornings and the vitamin D analogue (calcipotriol or calcitriol) at night) until achieving clearance or marked improvement or until 4 weeks had elapsed. Participants then switched to a monotherapy maintenance phase with the vitamin D product for the remainder of the 12-week study period. The IAGI results showed the 2 treatment regimens to be equivalent: -0.19 (95% CI -0.54 to 0.16).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 14: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other treatment: long-term studies (&gt; 24 weeks)</HEADING>

One longer-term placebo-controlled trial of the body (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1991a</LINK>) and two long-term scalp trials (<LINK REF="STD-Luger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 2010</LINK>) did not meet the inclusion criteria for this comparison, and they are evaluated elsewhere (Analysis 2, Analysis 19, and Analysis 18, respectively).</P>
<P>One trial was included in this comparison; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK> was a between-patient trial that compared three 52-week regimens with all treatments used once daily:</P>

</UL>
<P>In total, 297 participants contributed IGA data to the analysis. Data were unsuitable for pooling because the same participants contributed to more than one analysis.</P>
<P>According to the investigators' assessment, there was no significant difference between the three long-term regimens. One year's combination therapy was not significantly better than either the alternating regimen (SMD -0.09; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.18) or the regimen of treatment with 4 weeks of combination therapy followed by 48 weeks of calcipotriol (SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.47 to 0.10). In both these comparisons, combination therapy achieved a larger absolute benefit, but the difference was not statistically significant. When alternating therapy was compared with the regimen of 4 weeks' combination therapy followed by 48 weeks of calcipotriol, the SMD for the IAGI also indicated the two regimens were not statistically significantly different: -0.09 (95% CI -0.37 to 0.19).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 15: Vitamin D analogues versus other treatment</HEADING>
<P>This comparison incorporated all other vitamin D head-to-head comparisons of treatments for psoriasis of the body (excluding inverse psoriasis) that had not already been included (see <LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK>). We included 12 intervention-comparator contrasts, with IAGI data available for 6 of these contrasts. Eight between-patient trials and 2 within-patient trials provided data for 1386 participants. Trial duration ranged between 4 and 12 weeks. In light of the pharmacological diversity amongst the comparators, we only pooled data within subgroups.</P>
<P>According to the investigator's global assessment, twice-daily calcipotriol was significantly more effective than coal tar polytherapy (SMD -0.59; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.31; I² statistic = 0%). Once-daily vitamin D was significantly less effective than a twice-daily application (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.09; I² statistic = 0%). This contrast included a comparison of once- versus twice-daily dosing of calcipotriol (SMD -0.27; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.06) and a dosing comparison combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.00).</P>
<P>In the remaining four intervention-comparator contrasts, no significant difference was found between twice-daily calcipotriol and the comparators. This finding held for the comparison against coal tar monotherapy (SMD -0.53; 95% CI -1.74 to 0.68; I² statistic = 91.1%), against betamethasone dipropionate ointment and salicylic acid (SMD -0.06; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.22; I² statistic = NA), against tacrolimus ointment (SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.60 to 0.16; I² statistic = NA), and against vitamin B12 cream (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -1.33 to 0.24; I² statistic = NA).</P>
<P>Two of the three trials comparing calcipotriol with coal tar monotherapy found a significant difference in favour of calcipotriol; the other trial found a significant difference in favour of coal tar (<LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK>).

Evidence on four treatments was found in this comparison: the potent steroid betamethasone valerate; the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol; and two topical calcineurin inhibitors, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. We only found one trial that evaluated tacrolimus ointment (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2004</LINK>), but the study did not report any effectiveness data suitable for this review. However, the study did contribute data on adverse events and withdrawal rates.</P>

Calcitriol was compared with tacrolimus.</P>
<P>Two between-patient studies contributed IAGI data from 457 study participants on 2 of the 5 intervention-comparator contrasts. Trial duration ranged from six to eight weeks.

We included evidence on 11 treatments in this comparison, with IAGI data available for 9 treatments. Ten trials, 9 of which were between-patient studies, contributed data from 2472 participants. One study was a within-patient trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lepaw-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Lepaw 1978</LINK>). Trial duration ranged between two and eight weeks. IAGI data were not available for betamethasone valerate or ciclopirox olamine shampoo.</P>
<P>Eight treatments for scalp psoriasis that were assessed using the IAGI scale were significantly more effective than placebo. The least effective treatment was calcipotriol (SMD -0.72; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.16; I² statistic = 69.2%), and the most effective treatment was clobetasol propionate (SMD -1.73; 95% CI -1.99 to -1.48; I² statistic = 14.3%). Combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate was also effective (SMD -0.97; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.32; I² statistic = 90.2%). Data from the three very potent corticosteroids were pooled (amcinonide, clobetasol propionate, halcinonide). The SMD across these treatments was -1.57 (95% CI -1.85 to -1.28; I² statistic = 49.7%).

Nineteen studies reported TSS data with 2647 participants contributing data. Nine trials were between-patient design, and 10 were within-patient studies.

The high level of heterogeneity means that the estimated average benefit should be treated with caution; there was considerable variation between effective treatments, with the TSS ranging from -0.46 (becocalcidiol twice daily) to -2.15 (paricalcitol once daily). Therefore, we removed pooling across subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

Three between-patient trials and 1 within-patient trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grattan-1997-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Grattan 1997 (H)</LINK>) reported TSS data for 386 participants.

These factors may help explain the substantial heterogeneity found in the pooled results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The SMD for the TSS was -0.27 (95% CI -0.73 to 0.20; I² statistic = 80.6%).

Evidence on four treatments was found in this comparison: the potent steroid betamethasone valerate; the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol; and two topical calcineurin inhibitors, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. We found only one placebo-controlled trial that evaluated tacrolimus ointment (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2004</LINK>), but the study did not report any effectiveness data suitable for this review.

<P>This comparison summarises findings on complex regimens for body psoriasis, defined here as treatment sequences that do not consist of a simple head-to-head comparison between two active treatments (see <LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>). PASI data were available for 11 of the 12 intervention-comparator contrasts identified. Data from 2991 participants contributed to the PASI analysis, based on findings from 8 between-patient trials. Trial duration varied between 2 and 12 weeks. Because the interventions and comparators were highly variable and two trials each contributed three pair-wise contrasts, we did not pool the data.</P>
<P>Six intervention-comparator contrasts for which PASI data were available found a significant difference between regimens. A six-week course of calcipotriol was compared with two different complex regimens. Monotherapy with calcipotriol was significantly less effective than two weeks of treatment with calcipotriol and fluocinonide acetonide followed by four weeks of calcipotriol (SMD 0.66; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.32) (<LINK REF="STD-Wozel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wozel 2001</LINK>). Calcipotriol monotherapy was also less effective than treatment with calcipotriol to which halometasone was added (SMD 1.13; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.62) (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>). Monotherapy with tacalcitol (8 weeks) was less effective than sequential treatment with a combined calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate product (4 weeks) followed by calcipotriol monotherapy for a further 4 weeks (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.67) (<LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-White-2006-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">White 2006 (P)</LINK> compared three regimens, all of which included an initial phase in which participants applied combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate once a day for four weeks. The subsequent eight-week maintenance phase using placebo ointment was significantly less effective than maintenance with either twice-daily calcipotriol (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.39), or maintenance with calcipotriol on weekdays and combination treatment at weekends (SMD 0.59; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.74). When the two active maintenance regimens were compared directly, the alternating (weekday/weekend) regimen was significantly more efficacious (SMD 0.30; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.45) (<LINK REF="STD-White-2006-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">White 2006 (H)</LINK>).</P>

<P>According to the PASI assessment, twice-daily calcipotriol was significantly more effective than coal tar polytherapy (SMD -0.63; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.20; I² statistic = NA) as well as propylthiouracil cream (SMD -2.24; 95% CI -3.23 to -1.25; I² statistic = NA). Twice-daily calcipotriol was not significantly more effective than coal tar (SMD -0.10; 95% CI -1.54 to 1.35; I² statistic = 92.8%), betamethasone dipropionate and salicylic acid (SMD -0.05; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.26; I² statistic = NA), or vitamin B12 cream (SMD -0.01; 95% CI -0.78 to 0.75; I² statistic = NA). The high level of heterogeneity observed in the pooled analysis of calcipotriol versus coal tar reflects contradictory findings from two studies, one finding in favour of calcipotriol (<LINK REF="STD-Tham-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tham 1994</LINK>) and the other in favour of coal tar (<LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK>).</P>

Calcipotriol was more effective than coal tar both as monotherapy (SMD -1.51; 95% CI -2.12 to -0.90; <LINK REF="STD-Tham-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tham 1994</LINK>) and as polytherapy (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.99 to -0.13; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2002a</LINK>), and more effective than betamethasone dipropionate and salicylic acid (SMD -0.49; 95% CI -0.79 to -0.20; <LINK REF="STD-Scarpa-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scarpa 1994</LINK>).

We found evidence on four treatments in this comparison: the potent steroid betamethasone valerate; the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol; and two topical calcineurin inhibitors, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. We identified only one placebo-controlled trial evaluating tacrolimus ointment (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2004</LINK>), but the study did not report any effectiveness data suitable for this review. However, the study did contribute data on adverse events and withdrawal rates.</P>

One 8-week between-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Gribetz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gribetz 2004</LINK>) reported data from 47 participants. Relative to placebo, the SMD for the PAGI found a statistically significant difference in favour of twice-daily pimecrolimus cream (SMD -0.65; 95% CI -1.24 to -0.06).</P>

<P>Four of the five treatments for scalp psoriasis that were evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment Scale were significantly more effective than placebo. The least effective treatment was calcipotriol (SMD -0.66; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.05; I² statistic = 74.5%), and the most effective was betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -1.23; 95% CI -1.43 to -1.03; I² statistic = NA). Effects for the very potent steroid amcinonide (SMD -0.97; 95% CI -1.33 to -0.61 I² statistic = NA) and combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -1.00; 95% CI -1.79 to -0.22; I² statistic = 93.2%) fell between these two extremes.

<P>Our review included eight vitamin D analogues for body psoriasis in this comparison (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Thirty studies, involving 4986 participants, contributed data. Eighteen trials were between-patient design, and 12 were within-patient studies. Treatment duration ranged from 3 to 12 weeks. Six studies had adequately concealed treatment allocation. The pooled effect across all 30 studies was -0.90 (95% CI -1.07 to -0.72; I² statistic = 87.5%), which equates to 1.03 on a 6-point IAGI scale. However, the summary statistic conceals considerable variation between treatments. In two treatments, the effect was not statistically significantly different to placebo (twice-daily calcipotriol plus occlusion for 2 weeks followed by 4 weeks with no treatment, and once-daily becocalcidiol). In treatments that were significantly more effective than placebo, the effect ranged from -0.67 (twice-daily becocalcidiol) to -1.66 (once-daily paricalcitol); on a 6-point IAGI scale, these effects translate into 0.80 and 1.91 points, respectively. However, given the high level of heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis, it may be more informative to look at individual products within the class, rather than treating this class as a single group. We removed the pooling across the class, so that we only pooled subtotals.</P>

<P>We explored differences in within-patient and between-patient designs using one-way sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The SMD for the 12 within-patient studies (600 participants) was -1.11 (95% CI -1.58 to -0.64; I² statistic = 91.5%). This translates into a change of 1.27 on a 6-point IAGI scale, slightly larger than the effect size for all studies. The SMD for the 18 between-patient studies (4386 participants) was -0.80 (95% CI -0.96 to -0.63; I² statistic = 83.2%). This translates into a change of 0.91 on a 6-point IAGI scale, slightly smaller than the effect size for the within-patient studies.</P>
<P>We also used sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of varying the correlation coefficient (rho) for the 12 within-patient studies. As no trial in the review reported this statistic, we tested values of 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. Varying the value of rho for the within-patient studies had no significant effect on the findings: The pooled SMD ranged from -0.85 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.71; I² statistic = 87.8%; 30 studies), when we assumed the correlation to be zero, to -0.91 (95% CI -1.07 to -0.75; I² statistic = 93.2%; 30 studies), when we assumed the correlation to be 0.75.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1996</LINK> comparing calcitriol and placebo reported large and statistically significant differences for both TSS and IAGI outcomes. In both outcomes, the magnitude of the effect was the largest across all comparisons and treatments. <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1996</LINK> was a 10-week within-patient study involving 84 participants. The study included people with severe disease (mean TSS at baseline: 7.6 on a 10-point scale, with at least 10% of body surface area affected) who had previously had an unsatisfactory response to at least 1 previous treatment including topical steroids, UVB, PUVA, and methotrexate. The dramatic improvement observed in the intervention group is difficult to interpret in the context of findings from other trials, and we explored the impact of removing this study in a sensitivity analysis. When we removed <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1996</LINK> from the pooled analysis for calcitriol, the effect size was smaller but still statistically significantly different from placebo: SMD with <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1996 </LINK>was -0.92 (95% CI -1.54 to -0.29; I² statistic = 94.9%; 7 studies), and SMD without <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1996</LINK> was -0.60 (95% CI -0.78 to -0.41; I² statistic = 30%; 6 studies). On a 6-point IAGI scale, these effect sizes equate to 1.05 and 0.68, respectively (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials of calcipotriol varied by dose, treatment duration, and dosing frequency; where trials reported more than one dose (<LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 1988b</LINK>) or type of vehicle (<LINK REF="STD-Harrington-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrington 1996a</LINK>), we estimated the weighted mean and standard deviation across the trial. The effect size for twice-daily regimens was -1.02 (95% CI -1.23 to -0.82 I² statistic = 73.5%; 13 studies); this equates to 1.18 on a 6-point IAGI scale. For once-daily calcipotriol, the corresponding figures were -0.76 (95% CI -1.13 to -0.40; I² statistic = 82.3%; 4 studies) and 0.87 on a 6-point IAGI scale.

The treatments included three betamethasone dipropionate regimens, but we identified no effectiveness evidence for budesonide and no study reporting PAGI data. Therefore, 13 studies involving 2216 participants contributed data on 9 of the 10 treatments. Eleven trials were between-patient design, and two were within-patient studies. Treatment allocation was adequately concealed in four studies. Treatment duration ranged from 2 to 12 weeks.

With the exception of diflorasone diacetate (<LINK REF="STD-Lane-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lane 1983</LINK>), all potent corticosteroids were significantly more effective than placebo at the 5% level of significance.

When assessed using the TSS (one study), PASI (four studies), and PAGI (two studies), calcipotriol was significantly more effective than betamethasone valerate (see <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>, and <LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>). There were similar inconsistencies between the outcome assessments for the comparison of calcitriol with betamethasone dipropionate, all of which we based on a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Camarasa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Camarasa 2003</LINK>). According to the TSS and PASI, calcitriol was significantly less effective than betamethasone dipropionate, but the IAGI indicated that the difference was not significant (see <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one intervention-comparator contrast (calcipotriol versus fluocinonide), the vitamin D analogue was significantly more effective than potent corticosteroid: SMD -0.58 (95% CI: -0.99 to -0.18; I² statistic = NA). This effect is equivalent to a gain of approximately two-thirds of a point (0.64) on a 6-point IAGI scale. In three intervention-comparator contrasts, the potent corticosteroid was significantly more effective than the vitamin D analogue (calcipotriol versus betamethasone dipropionate, calcipotriol versus diflorasone diacetate, tacalcitol versus betamethasone valerate). The SMD effect sizes for these were 0.43, 0.27, and 0.41, respectively, equivalent to improvements of 0.47, 0.30, and 0.45 on a 6-point IAGI scale.</P>

<P>We explored differences in within-patient and between-patient designs using one-way sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). In both types of design, the difference between vitamin D and potent corticosteroid was not statistically significant, but we associated the pooled results with substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The SMD for the 5 within-patient studies (554 participants) was 0.17 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.54; I² statistic = 81.9%). The SMD for the 9 between-patient studies (2988 participants) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.31; I² statistic = 84.9%).</P>
<P>We also used sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of varying the correlation coefficient (rho) for the 5 within-patient studies. As no trial in the review reported this statistic, we tested values of 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. Varying the value of rho for the within-patient studies had no significant effect on the findings: The pooled SMD ranged from 0.10 (95% CI -0.08 to 0.28; I² statistic = 90.5%; 14 studies), when we assumed the correlation to be zero, to 0.12 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.30; I² statistic = 94.3%), when we assumed the correlation to be 0.75.</P>

Five parallel-group studies, ranging in treatment duration from 2 to 8 weeks, provided data on 2113 participants. The adequacy of the concealment of treatment allocation was unclear in all five trials.</P>
<P>Effectiveness data were available for three contrasts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate versus betamethasone dipropionate;</LI>
<LI>calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate versus clobetasol propionate; and</LI>
<LI>calcipotriol plus clobetasol propionate versus clobetasol propionate.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Overall, combination treatment was more effective than monotherapy with corticosteroids: SMD -0.26 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.00; I² statistic = 84.4%; 5 studies). This effect is equivalent to a change of 0.29 on a 6-point IAGI scale. However, the pooled finding masks important diversity between the three intervention-comparator contrasts. When we compared combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate with a potent steroid (betamethasone dipropionate alone), combination treatment was more effective (SMD -0.40; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.27; I² statistic = 41.8%; 3 studies). However, the same combination treatment was significantly less effective than monotherapy with a very potent steroid (clobetasol propionate) (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.81; I² statistic = NA). Calcipotriol in combination with clobetasol propionate however was more effective than the very potent steroid used alone (SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.15; I² statistic = NA). Therefore, we removed pooling for this analysis, but the findings demonstrate that combination treatment with vitamin D analogue and a corticosteroid is more effective than the same steroid used as a monotherapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 10: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus dithranol</HEADING>
<P>This comparison considered vitamin D analogues against dithranol for body psoriasis (see <LINK REF="CMP-010.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). We identified three intervention-comparator contrasts: calcipotriol versus dithranol, calcitriol versus dithranol, and tacalcitol versus dithranol. Seven between-patient trials and one within-patient trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grattan-1997-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Grattan 1997 (H)</LINK>) reported data for 1284 participants. We considered concealment of treatment allocation to be adequate in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2006</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from 4 weeks to 12 weeks. In addition, there was some variation in the dithranol regimens employed by trials and in the baseline severity of trial participants. These factors may explain the high level of heterogeneity found in the pooled results.</P>
<P>The SMD for the combined end point was 0.09 (95% CI -0.44 to 0.63; I² statistic = 94.9%; 8 studies), indicating that there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in effect between vitamin D analogues and dithranol. The pooled findings for calcipotriol against dithranol (SMD 0.07; 95% CI -0.57 to 0.71; I² statistic = 95.7%; 6 studies) and tacalcitol versus dithranol (SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.60 to 0.25; I² statistic = NA) were aligned with, and drove, this result. However, the high levels of heterogeneity mean that findings merit closer scrutiny. Six studies contributed data from 1086 participants to the comparison of calcipotriol and dithranol. In three of these studies, calcipotriol performed significantly better than dithranol; two trials found significant differences in favour of dithranol; and one study found no significant difference between the treatments (see <LINK REF="CMP-010.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.5</LINK>). A single study of 114 participants compared calcitriol against dithranol (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 2000</LINK>) and found a statistically significant difference in favour of dithranol (SMD 0.51; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.88; I² statistic = NA). This equates to just over half a point (0.56 of a point) improvement on a 6-point IAGI scale. However, the same study found no significant difference between the treatments in the assessment using the TSS (<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>) or the PASI (<LINK REF="CMP-010.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 11: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other vitamin D analogue</HEADING>
<P>Our review identified three intervention-comparator contrasts for body psoriasis in this comparison: calcipotriol versus calcitriol, calcipotriol versus tacalcitol, and calcipotriol versus maxacalcitol (see <LINK REF="CMP-011.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>). Four trials involving 513 participants contributed data. One trial was within-patient (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1999-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1999 (H)</LINK>); three were between-patient in design; and no trials demonstrated the concealment of treatment allocation to be adequate. Treatment duration ranged from 8 to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>The SMD for the combined end point indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the treatments: -0.17 (95% CI -0.62 to 0.27; I² statistic = 78.5%; 4 studies). When we considered individual intervention-comparator contrasts using the combined end point, calcipotriol was more effective than tacalcitol (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.21; I² statistic = NA), which equates to an improvement of 0.52 on a 6-point IAGI scale. However, there was no statistically significant difference between calcipotriol and calcitriol (SMD -0.41; 95% CI -1.46 to 0.64; I² statistic = 72.3%; 2 studies) or between calcipotriol and maxacalcitol (SMD 0.43; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.98; I² statistic = NA).

<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ji-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ji 2008</LINK> used three outcome measures to assess the effects of calcipotriol and calcitriol.

As findings for <LINK REF="STD-Ji-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ji 2008</LINK> varied depending on the outcome measure used, we tested the impact of using TSS data for the combined end point instead of IAGI data. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that findings were robust, both for the SMD for the combined end point for all treatments (SMD -0.28; 95% CI -0.66 to 0.10; I² statistic = 70.6%; 4 studies) and for the comparison of calcipotriol and calcitriol (SMD -0.52; 95% CI -1.19 to 0.15; I² statistic = 44.9%; 2 studies).</P>

<P>Our review identified 12 intervention-comparator contrasts for body psoriasis, involving 3 vitamin D analogues, 2 combination products, and 7 different corticosteroids (see <LINK REF="CMP-012.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>). Seventeen trials involving 5856 participants contributed data. Sixteen trials were between-patient, and 1 was within-patient in design (<LINK REF="STD-Salmhofer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Salmhofer 2000</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. Four trials adequately concealed treatment allocation, but concealment was inadequate in one trial (in the other trials, insufficient data were reported to allow an assessment of adequacy).</P>
<P>Overall, vitamin D plus corticosteroid was more effective than vitamin D alone: The SMD for the combined end point was 0.46 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.59; I² statistic = 83.3%; 17 studies), which translates into half of 1 point (0.50) on a 6-point IAGI scale. The substantial level of heterogeneity reflects not only different dosing schedules of the intervention and comparator products, but also the different potency of the corticosteroids and the different vitamin D analogues evaluated; we therefore removed pooling (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twice-daily calcipotriol was significantly less effective than combination treatment with betamethasone dipropionate. This finding held whether participants applied the corticosteroid separately at night time (SMD 0.56; equivalent to 0.61 on a 6-point IAGI scale) or as a combined product used once daily or twice daily (SMD 0.43 and 0.66, respectively, translating into improvements of 0.48 and 0.73 points on a 6-point IAGI scale). Twice-daily calcipotriol was also significantly less effective than combination treatment with clobetasone butyrate (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.48; I² statistic = NA; 0.29 of a point on a 6-point IAGI) or clobetasol propionate (SMD 0.88; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.42; I² statistic = NA; 0.97 of a point on a 6-point IAGI scale). Once-daily combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate was significantly more effective than once-daily treatment with either calcipotriol (SMD 0.66; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.02; I² statistic = 80.9%; 2 studies) or tacalcitol (SMD 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70; I² statistic = NA).</P>
<P>In none of the 12 intervention-comparator contrasts was the vitamin D analogue significantly more effective than combined vitamin D plus corticosteroid. However, in five instances, there was no significant difference between vitamin D and the comparator (combination treatment). These included twice-daily calcipotriol against combination treatment with betamethasone valerate or diflucortolone valerate, once-daily calcipotriol against combination treatment with fluocinonide acetonide or hydrocortisone, and twice-daily calcitriol against combination treatment with diflucortolone valerate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 13: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other treatments: complex regimens</HEADING>
<P>This comparison summarises complex regimens for body psoriasis, defined here as treatment sequences that do not consist of a simple head-to-head comparison between two active treatments (see <LINK REF="CMP-013.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>). Using the combined end point, data were available for all 12 intervention-comparator contrasts (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Data were available from 2936 participants from 8 between-patient trials and 1 within-patient trial (<LINK REF="STD-Austad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Austad 1998</LINK>). Trial duration varied between 2 and 12 weeks. One trial adequately concealed treatment allocation. As the interventions and comparators were highly variable and because two trials each contributed three pair-wise contrasts, we did not pool the data.</P>
<P>Seven intervention-comparator contrasts found a significant difference between regimens. Six weeks' monotherapy with twice-daily calcipotriol was less effective than clobetasol propionate (2 weeks) followed by 4 weeks' monotherapy with calcipotriol (SMD 0.60; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.02) (<LINK REF="STD-Austad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Austad 1998</LINK>). A similar effect was evident when calcipotriol monotherapy (once daily for two weeks, then twice daily for four weeks) was compared with two weeks of treatment with calcipotriol (mornings) and fluocinonide acetonide (evenings), followed by 4 weeks' monotherapy with calcipotriol (SMD 0.66; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.32) (<LINK REF="STD-Wozel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wozel 2001</LINK>). These benefits translated into improvements of 0.66 and 0.72 (i.e. around two-thirds of a point) on a 6-point IAGI scale.</P>
<P>The 12-week trial by <LINK REF="STD-White-2006-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">White 2006 (H)</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-White-2006-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">White 2006 (P)</LINK> compared 3 regimens; all included an initial phase in which participants applied once-daily combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate for 4 weeks, but differed in their subsequent 8-week maintenance phase. Maintenance therapy with twice-daily placebo ointment was significantly less effective than maintenance with either calcipotriol ointment (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41) or maintenance with calcipotriol on weekdays and combination treatment at weekends (SMD 0.51; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66). When we directly compared the two regimens with active maintenance options, the alternating (weekday/weekend) approach was significantly more effective (SMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40). The benefits of these 3 regimens equate to an improvement of 0.29, 0.56, and 0.28 of a point, respectively, on a 6-point IAGI scale. These findings, based on the investigators' assessment of severity, were aligned with those of both the PASI assessment (<LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>) and the participants' assessment (PAGI) (<LINK REF="CMP-013.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.4</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2004</LINK> compared 12 weeks of calcipotriol monotherapy with 2 complex regimens, both of which involved different sequences of combination therapy (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate) and calcipotriol. When we directly compared these two complex regimens, 8 weeks of combination therapy followed by 4 weeks of once-daily calcipotriol was significantly less effective than a routine involving 4 weeks of combination therapy followed by 8 weeks of once-daily calcipotriol on weekdays and combination therapy at the weekend (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40, equivalent to 0.27 (¼ of 1 point) on a 6-point IAGI scale). This finding was based on the investigators' assessment (IAGI), which was very similar to the participants' (PAGI) assessment (<LINK REF="CMP-013.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.4</LINK>). However, the PASI found a non-significant trend in favour of the weekday/weekend regimen (<LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In five intervention-comparator contrasts, we found no significant difference.

Compared with monotherapy, participants who applied once-daily combination treatment (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate) for 8 weeks followed by once-daily calcipotriol for 4 weeks did not experience a significantly greater improvement (SMD -0.12; 95% CI -0.29 to 0.04). Similarly, the psoriasis of participants on monotherapy with twice-daily calcipotriol did not improve significantly more or less than the disease in participants who applied once-daily combination treatment (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate) for 4 weeks followed by 8 weeks using once-daily calcipotriol (weekdays) and once-daily combination therapy (weekends) (SMD 0.13; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.29). These findings were based on the investigators' assessment (IAGI), which were consistent with those of the participants (<LINK REF="CMP-013.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.4</LINK>) and with the PASI assessment (<LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>).</P>

One longer-term placebo-controlled trial of the body (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1991a</LINK>) and two long-term scalp trials (<LINK REF="STD-Luger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 2010</LINK>) did not meet the inclusion criteria for this comparison, so we evaluated them elsewhere (Analyses 2, 19, and 18, respectively).</P>
<P>This comparison included one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK>, which was a between-patient trial that compared 3 52-week regimens with all treatments used once daily:</P>

In both these comparisons, combination therapy achieved a larger absolute benefit, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Three studies adequately concealed treatment allocation. In light of the pharmacological diversity of the comparators, we only pooled data within subgroups.</P>
<P>In three intervention-comparator contrasts, vitamin D was significantly more effective than the comparator. Specifically, twice-daily calcipotriol was more effective than coal tar polytherapy (SMD -0.59; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.31; I² statistic = 0%; 2 studies) and propylthiouracil cream (SMD -2.24; 95% CI -3.23 to -1.25; I² statistic = NA). On a 6-point IAGI scale, these equate to improvements of 0.65 of a point and 2.46 points, respectively. Twice-daily vitamin D was significantly more effective than once-daily treatment (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.32 to -0.07; I² statistic = 0%; 3 studies), achieving an additional improvement of around 0.22 of a point on a 6-point IAGI scale. This finding was based on dosing assessments of 2 vitamin D products: calcipotriol (SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.02; I² statistic = 12%; 2 studies) and combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.00; I² statistic = NA).</P>
<P>In the remaining eight intervention-comparator contrasts, we found no significant difference between twice-daily calcipotriol and the comparators. This finding held for the comparison against the following products: coal tar monotherapy (SMD -0.53; 95% CI -1.74 to 0.68; I² statistic = 91.1%; 3 studies); nicotinamide, either alone (SMD -0.09; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.31; I² statistic: NA) or in combination with calcipotriol (SMD 0.19; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.52; I² statistic = NA); betamethasone dipropionate ointment and salicylic acid (SMD -0.05; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.15; I² statistic = NA); tacrolimus ointment (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -1.28 to 0.17; I² statistic = 75.9%; 2 studies); tazarotene (SMD -0.10; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.16; I² statistic = 0%; 2 studies); and vitamin B12 cream (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -1.33 to 0.24; I² statistic = NA). The addition of occlusion to calcipotriol did not significantly improve the drug's effectiveness (SMD -0.18; 95% CI -2.04 to 1.68; I² statistic = 96.2%; 2 studies).</P>
<P>Two of the three trials comparing calcipotriol with coal tar monotherapy found a significant difference in favour of calcipotriol (<LINK REF="STD-De-Simone-1993" TYPE="STUDY">De Simone 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tham-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tham 1994</LINK>); the other trial found a significant difference in favour of coal tar (<LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK>). This apparent contradiction may reflect different formulations of coal tar, treatment durations, or different baseline disease severity. <LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK> also assessed effectiveness and quality of life over the six-week post-treatment period, finding that the coal tar group maintained their improvement significantly better than those treated with calcipotriol (see section (c) Quality of life measures).</P>
<P>The two occlusion trials used very different regimens and may be better considered separately. <LINK REF="STD-Hinds_x00e9_n-2006-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hindsén 2006 (H)</LINK> compared calcipotriol with occlusion (applied once weekly for 2 weeks) followed by 4 weeks off treatment against 6 weeks of calcipotriol monotherapy. This trial does not provide a simple assessment of occlusion, since, additionally, treatment is withdrawn. This parallel-group trial contributed data from 209 participants with moderately severe disease and found monotherapy was significantly more effective at the 6-week end point (SMD -1.11; 95% CI -1.40 to -0.81). In the other trial, 19 participants were treated for 8 weeks with twice-daily calcipotriol on both sides of the body, and one side was randomised to receive overnight occlusion with polythene. <LINK REF="STD-Bourke-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Bourke 1993b</LINK> found a significant difference in favour of occlusion (SMD 0.79; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.45); the trial did not explicitly state the severity of participants.</P>
<P>We reported elsewhere trials comparing vitamin D and other treatments for scalp psoriasis (<LINK REF="CMP-019.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 19.5</LINK>) and inverse psoriasis (<LINK REF="CMP-017.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.5</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 16: Flexural/facial psoriasis: placebo-controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included placebo-controlled trials of topical treatments for inverse or facial psoriasis (see <LINK REF="CMP-016.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK>). We found evidence on four treatments in this comparison: the potent steroid betamethasone valerate; the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol; and two topical calcineurin inhibitors, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. We identified only one placebo-controlled trial evaluating tacrolimus ointment (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2004</LINK>), but the study did not report any effectiveness data suitable for this review. However, the study did contribute data on adverse events and withdrawal rates. We pooled only subtotals in this comparison.</P>
<P>Using the combined end point, data were available for three of the four topical treatments for inverse psoriasis. Two between-patient trials contributed data from 122 participants. <LINK REF="STD-Gribetz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gribetz 2004</LINK> was a eight-week study that evaluated twice-daily pimecrolimus cream. The four-week trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-2006-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 2006 (P)</LINK> compared betamethasone valerate, calcipotriol, and pimecrolimus against placebo; all treatments were applied once daily. Treatment allocation was adequately concealed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gribetz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gribetz 2004</LINK>). Therefore, we based the findings for each treatment on a single study.</P>
<P>The SMD for the combined end point found a statistically significant difference in favour of betamethasone valerate (SMD -2.83; 95% CI -3.79 to -1.88) and calcipotriol ointment (SMD -1.08; 95% CI -1.77 to -0.40). These equate to improvements of 3.25 points and 1.24 points on a 6-point IAGI scale. Pimecrolimus cream was also significantly more effective than vehicle (SMD -0.86; 95% CI -1.30 to -0.41; I² statistic = 0%), equivalent to almost 1 point on a 6-point IAGI. This result pooled data on twice-daily applications for 8 weeks (SMD -1.07; 95% CI -1.69 to -0.45) and once-daily pimecrolimus cream for 4 weeks (SMD -0.62; 95% CI -1.27 to 0.02). These findings suggest that different dosing schedules may influence efficacy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 17: Flexural/facial psoriasis: vitamin D alone or in combination versus other treatment</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included head-to-head trials of treatments for inverse psoriasis, where we compared vitamin D with an active control (see <LINK REF="CMP-017.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK>). We identified five intervention-comparator contrasts. Four treatments were compared with calcipotriol: once-daily betamethasone valerate, combined treatment with calcipotriol and hydrocortisone, calcitriol, and pimecrolimus. Calcitriol was compared with tacrolimus.</P>
<P>Using the combined end point, data were available for all five intervention-comparator contrasts. Four trials, varying in duration from 4 to 8 weeks, contributed data from 588 participants. Three studies were between-patient trials, and one was a within-patient study (<LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2003</LINK>). The adequacy of concealment of treatment allocation was unclear in all four trials.</P>
<P>When applied to sensitive areas of the body, calcipotriol was significantly less effective than three of the comparators. These included betamethasone valerate (SMD 2.02; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.84) (<LINK REF="STD-Kreuter-2006-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuter 2006 (H)</LINK>), combination treatment with calcipotriol and hydrocortisone (SMD 0.30; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.50) (<LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2010</LINK>), and calcitriol (SMD 0.61; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.94) (<LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2003</LINK>). On a 6-point IAGI scale, the additional benefit equates to 2.22 points for betamethasone valerate, &#8531; of a point for combination treatment with hydrocortisone, and &#8532; of a point for calcitriol.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between vitamin D and the topical calcineurin inhibitors (calcipotriol versus pimecrolimus: SMD -0.53 (95% CI -1.17 to 0.11; I² statistic = NA); calcitriol versus tacrolimus: SMD 0.42 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.98; I² statistic = NA)).</P>

Thirteen between-patient trials and 1 within-patient trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lepaw-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Lepaw 1978</LINK>) contributed data from 3011 participants. Trial duration ranged between two and eight weeks. Concealment of treatment allocation was adequate in one trial.</P>
<P>Two treatments were not significantly more effective than placebo. These were ciclopirox olamine shampoo (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.82 to 0.68; I² statistic = NA) and salicylic acid (SMD -0.86; 95% CI -1.79 to 0.06; I² statistic = NA). Of the nine treatments demonstrated to be significantly more effective than placebo, corticosteroids achieved the largest effects. Two very potent corticosteroids, amcinonide (SMD -1.42; 95% CI -1.80 to -1.04; I² statistic = NA) and clobetasol propionate (SMD -1.57; 95% CI -1.81 to -1.34; I² statistic = 43.3%; 4 studies), delivered benefits equating to almost 2 points (1.70 and 1.88 points, respectively) on a 6-point IAGI (Investigator's Assessment of Global Improvement) scale. Betamethasone dipropionate combined with salicylic acid achieved a similar effect (SMD -1.48; 95% CI -2.50 to -0.47; I² statistic = NA), translating into 1.77 point improvement on the 6-point IAGI over and above placebo.</P>
<P>When used as monotherapy, the 2 potent corticosteroids evaluated were both more effective than placebo: Betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -1.09; 95% CI -1.29 to -0.90; I² statistic = 0%; 2 studies) had a smaller effect than betamethasone valerate (SMD -1.40; 95% CI -1.75 to -1.05; I² statistic = NA), although the difference was not statistically significant. Calcipotriol had the smallest observed benefit (SMD -0.72; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.16; I² statistic = 69.2%; 2 studies). When calcipotriol was combined with betamethasone dipropionate, the pooled effect was larger than for calcipotriol used alone (SMD -0.97; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.32; I² statistic = 90.2%; 2 studies), or 1.16 points on a 6-point improvement scale. <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> shows that both trials found combination therapy to be significantly more effective, but <LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2008-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2008 (P)</LINK> found a significantly larger effect (SMD -1.28; 95% CI -1.48 to -1.08) than <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 2010</LINK> (SMD -0.62; 95% CI -0.98 to -0.27).

<P>We identified six intervention-comparator contrasts, and data on the combined end point were available for all these contrasts. All studies were parallel-group in design (between-patient). Twelve studies contributed data from 5413 participants. Trial duration ranged from 4 to 8 weeks in 11 studies, but duration was 52 weeks in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Luger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2008</LINK>). The adequacy of the concealment of treatment allocation was unclear in all 12 trials.</P>
<P>Based on the combined end point scores, monotherapy with vitamin D was consistently less effective than monotherapy with potent or very potent corticosteroids, and it was also significantly less effective than combination therapy with vitamin D and a potent steroid. Specifically, calcipotriol was significantly less effective than betamethasone dipropionate (SMD 0.48; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.64; I² statistic = 60.4%; 2 studies), betamethasone valerate (SMD 0.37; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; I² statistic = 0%; 2 studies), and clobetasol propionate (SMD 0.37; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.69; I² statistic = NA). On a 6-point investigators' global assessment of improvement (IAGI) scale, these SMDs translate into 0.62, 0.48, and 0.48 points, respectively.</P>
<P>Combination treatment achieved a significantly greater benefit than either calcipotriol alone or betamethasone dipropionate alone. Calcipotriol was significantly less effective than combination treatment (SMD 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84; I² statistic = 82.3%; 4 studies), with combined therapy delivering a benefit equivalent to 0.83 of a point on a 6-point IAGI. Combination treatment was significantly more effective than monotherapy with betamethasone dipropionate (SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.10; I² statistic = 0%; 3 studies), translating into a net benefit of 0.24 of a point on a 6-point IAGI scale.</P>
<P>Compared with coal tar polytherapy, calcipotriol achieved a larger benefit, though this was not statistically significant at the 5% level (SMD -0.45; 95% CI -0.92 to 0.02; I² statistic = 89.8%; 3 studies).</P>

There was a small but statistically significant difference in favour of potent corticosteroids for withdrawals from the trials for any reason (total withdrawals): RD -0.14 (-0.22 to -0.05; I² statistic = 81.5%). This finding was driven by two large trials of once-daily betamethasone dipropionate (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2010-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2010 (P)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2002-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2002 (P)</LINK>) and two small trials of betamethasone dipropionate used as maintenance (weekend pulse therapy) (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1991a</LINK>).

<P>To simplify the analysis, we summarised withdrawal data by grouping the first 10 intervention-comparator pairs in a single category: calcipotriol versus calcipotriol and corticosteroid. The remaining comparisons were calcitriol versus calcitriol and corticosteroid, and tacalcitol versus calcipotriol and corticosteroid. We pooled withdrawal data using a random-effects risk difference (RD) metric (see <LINK REF="CMP-012.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.6</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-012.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.7,</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-012.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.8</LINK>). There were no data on withdrawals due to treatment failure for the comparisons of combined therapy versus calcitriol or combined therapy versus tacalcitol.</P>
<P>In the comparison of calcipotriol against calcipotriol plus corticosteroid, total withdrawals were statistically significantly different in favour of polytherapy: RD 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; I² statistic = 13.3%). We based this on findings from 4922 participants in 13 trials. Similarly, a significant difference in favour of polytherapy was evident from the data on withdrawals due to adverse events: RD 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.03; I² statistic = 32.9%). However, we found no statistically significant difference for withdrawals due to treatment failure (RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.00 to 0.02; I² statistic = 0%). When either calcitriol or tacalcitol was compared with combination therapy, differences in total withdrawals and in withdrawals due to adverse events were not statistically significant.</P>

<LI>Trial withdrawal rates were also significantly higher in participants receiving 12 weeks of monotherapy with calcipotriol than those treated with combination therapy (4 weeks) followed by alternating calcipotriol on weekdays and combination therapy at the weekend (8 weeks) (RD 0.08; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.13).</LI>
<LI>After an initial 4-week phase with combination ointment, participants who received 8 weeks' maintenance with calcipotriol (RD 0.08; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.14) or 8 weeks' maintenance with an alternating calcipotriol/combined therapy routine (RD 0.11; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.17) were significantly less likely to withdraw than participants who used vehicle ointment for maintenance.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the analysis of withdrawals due to adverse events (<LINK REF="CMP-013.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.7</LINK>), there were no significant differences between vitamin D and any of the complex regimens.</P>

<P>Relative to combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, calcipotriol monotherapy was associated with a significantly higher rate of total withdrawals (RD 0.11; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.18; I² statistic = 78.5%), withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.06; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.09; I² statistic = 78.9%) and withdrawals due to treatment failure (RD 0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10; I² statistic = 88.2%). Compared with betamethasone dipropionate, combination therapy was also significantly less likely to result in participant withdrawal due to treatment failure (RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.00; I² statistic = 0%).</P>
<P>Study participants treated with calcipotriol were significantly more likely to withdraw because of adverse events than participants receiving betamethasone valerate (RD 0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06; I² statistic = 0%) or coal tar polytherapy (RD 0.08; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14; I² statistic = NA).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 1: Vitamin D analogues versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>We pooled data on adverse events using a random-effects risk difference metric (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). There were no adverse events data for the comparison of calcipotriol plus occlusion versus placebo. Therefore, data were available for seven of the eight vitamin D analogues evaluated against placebo</P>
<P>Of the seven vitamin D analogues evaluated against placebo, we found only one statistically significantly difference. Twice-daily becocalcidiol was significantly more likely to cause local adverse events than placebo (RD 0.10; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.19). There were no significant differences for the pooled risk difference for either local adverse events (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02; I² statistic = 0%) or systemic adverse events (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; I² statistic = 0%).</P>

Data on local adverse events were available for 7 of the 10 corticosteroids; data on systemic adverse events were available only for betamethasone dipropionate twice daily, betamethasone dipropionate (maintenance), and mometasone furoate.</P>
<P>The pooled analysis of local adverse events found a significant difference in favour of corticosteroids (RD -0.04; 95% CI -0.08 to -0.00; I² statistic = 56.2%). Among the individual potent corticosteroids evaluated against placebo, we found only one statistically significantly difference. Once-daily betamethasone dipropionate was less likely than placebo to be associated with local adverse events: RD -0.10 (95% CI -0.15 to -0.04; I² statistic = 2.5%). We found no significant difference in the pooled analyses of systemic adverse events data.</P>

No data on adverse events were available for placebo comparisons involving polymyxin B cream, topical sirolimus, topical tacrolimus, coal tar, or tazarotene. Data on local adverse events were available for 22 comparisons, but data on systemic adverse events were reported for just 9 of the 26 comparisons. We assessed data on adverse events using a random-effects risk difference metric. The comparison with placebo found no statistically significant difference in the rate of either local or systemic adverse events for any treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 7: Vitamin D analogues versus corticosteroid (potent)</HEADING>
<P>Of the eight vitamin D analogues that were compared with potent corticosteroids, data on local adverse events were available for five comparisons, and data on systemic events were available for four comparisons (see <LINK REF="CMP-007.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-007.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.10</LINK>). There were no data on adverse events for calcipotriol versus desoxymetasone, calcipotriol versus diflorasone diacetate, and calcitriol versus betamethasone valerate. In addition, systemic adverse events data were unavailable for calcipotriol versus fluocinonide. We pooled data on adverse effects using a random-effects risk difference metric.</P>
<P>In the comparison of individual vitamin D analogues and potent corticosteroids, our review found one statistically significant difference in favour of potent corticosteroids. Pooled data from 3 trials with 1739 participants indicated that the rate of local adverse events was significantly higher in the calcipotriol group than in the group receiving betamethasone dipropionate (RD 0.07; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.09; I² statistic = 0%). This finding drove the pooled (class) result for local adverse events (RD 0.07; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; I² statistic = 82.4%). Our review found no other statistically significant differences for local or systemic adverse events in this comparison.</P>

No adverse events data were available for the comparison of combination (calcipotriol/clobetasol propionate) therapy and clobetasol propionate.</P>
<P>The pooled analysis found no statistically significant difference in adverse event rates between combination (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate) therapy and betamethasone dipropionate. There was no significant difference in local adverse events for combination (calcipotriol/betamethasone) therapy and clobetasol propionate, and there were no data on systemic adverse events for this comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 10: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus dithranol</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events data were available for three intervention-comparator pairs: calcipotriol versus dithranol, calcitriol versus dithranol, and tacalcitol versus dithranol. We pooled these data using a random-effects risk difference metric (see <LINK REF="CMP-010.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-010.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin D was statistically significantly less likely to cause local adverse events (RD -0.32; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.20; I² statistic = 84.5%), although substantial heterogeneity was evident in the pooled statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This finding also held for each of the three intervention-comparator pairs, with the effect size ranging from -0.25 (calcipotriol versus dithranol) to -0.67 (calcitriol versus dithranol). However, the analysis of systemic adverse events found no statistically significant differences.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 11: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other vitamin D analogue</HEADING>
<P>We reported local adverse events data on two of the vitamin D analogues head-to-head comparisons (see <LINK REF="CMP-011.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-011.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.10</LINK>). Systemic adverse events data were not available for any of the three comparisons. We pooled data on adverse effects using a random-effects risk difference metric. Overall, our review found no statistically significant difference on either local or systemic adverse events when comparing pooled vitamin D analogues head-to-head. However, in the comparison of calcipotriol against calcitriol, the rate of local adverse events was significantly lower for calcitriol: RD 0.07 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.14; I² statistic = NA).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 12: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus vitamin D + corticosteroid</HEADING>
<P>To simplify the comparison, we summarised adverse events data by grouping the first 10 intervention-comparator pairs in a single category: calcipotriol versus calcipotriol and corticosteroid. The remaining comparisons were 1) calcitriol versus calcitriol and 2) corticosteroid and tacalcitol versus calcipotriol and corticosteroid. There were no data on systemic adverse events for the comparison of tacalcitol against calcipotriol and corticosteroid.</P>
<P>We pooled data on adverse effects using a random-effects risk difference (RD) metric (see <LINK REF="CMP-012.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-012.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.10</LINK>). In the local adverse events comparison of vitamin D against vitamin D plus corticosteroid, our review found a statistically significantly difference in favour of combination therapy: RD 0.06 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.08; I² statistic = 4.1%). This finding also held for each individual intervention-comparator pair. Our analysis found no statistically significantly difference in the rates of systemic adverse events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 13: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other treatments: complex regimens</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included 12 intervention-comparator contrasts (see <LINK REF="CMP-013.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-013.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.10</LINK>). Data on local adverse events were available for 11 contrasts, but there were no data on the comparison of calcipotriol (12 weeks) versus combination therapy (4 weeks) followed by calcipotriol (8 weeks). No trial in this comparison reported data on systemic adverse events.</P>
<P>In 4 of the 11 contrasts for which data were available, the complex regimen was associated with a significantly lower rate of local adverse events than when the vitamin D analogue was used alone. Twelve weeks of calcipotriol monotherapy was associated with significantly higher rates of local adverse events than two complex regimen comparators. Specifically, the rate of local adverse events was higher for calcipotriol monotherapy than for a regimen consisting of 8 weeks of combination therapy followed by 4 weeks of once-daily calcipotriol (RD 0.11; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.17). Calcipotriol monotherapy was also more likely to be associated with local adverse events than 4 weeks of combination therapy followed by 8 weeks of once-daily calcipotriol on weekdays and combination therapy at the weekend (RD 0.11; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.17) (<LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2004</LINK>). When we compared the two complex regimens directly, the rates of cutaneous adverse events were not significantly different.</P>
<P>Relative to calcipotriol, combination therapy with halometasone and calcipotriol had a significantly lower rate of adverse events of the skin (RD 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.45). An 8-week course of tacalcitol had significantly higher rates of adverse events than a routine of 4 weeks' combined (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate) therapy followed by 4 weeks' monotherapy with calcipotriol (RD 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the rate of local adverse events in any of the remaining seven intervention-comparator contrasts.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 14: Vitamin D alone or in combination versus other treatment: long-term studies (&gt; 24 weeks)</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included active-controlled studies of psoriasis of the body that were at least 24 weeks in duration (see <LINK REF="CMP-014.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-014.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.10</LINK>). No data on systemic adverse events were reported. We included one trial in this comparison: <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK> compared 3 52-week regimens with all treatments used once daily.</P>
<P>Combination therapy with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate was associated with significantly lower rates of adverse events than either of the two 'complex' long-term regimens:</P>
<UL>
<LI>alternating treatment with combination therapy for 4 weeks, then calcipotriol for 4 weeks (RD -0.08; 95% CI -0.17 to -0.00); and</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis 15: vitamin D analogues versus other treatment</HEADING>
<P>A vitamin D analogue was compared with 12 other treatments (see <LINK REF="CMP-015.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.9</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-015.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.10</LINK>). Data on local adverse events were available for 10 intervention-comparator contrasts, and systemic adverse events data were available for 8 intervention-comparator contrasts.</P>
<P>We assessed results from the analyses of adverse events data using a random-effects risk difference metric and report these separately. For local adverse events, three intervention-comparator contrasts were significantly different. These were the comparison of calcipotriol against calcipotriol + nicotinamide (RD -0.17; 95% CI -0.30 to -0.03), calcipotriol versus corticosteroid + salicylic acid (RD 0.09; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.15), and calcipotriol versus tacrolimus ointment (RD -0.19; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.01).

<P>We did not include any of the eight RCTs in the main review. Six RCTs did not meet the inclusion criteria for the main review, because they did not address comparisons of interest (<LINK REF="REF-Andres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andres 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 1998b</LINK>) or effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Guzzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzzo 1996</LINK>). We excluded one RCT from the main review because it did not report the numbers of participants in each arm of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2001</LINK>). In all eight RCTs, the adequacy of concealment of treatment allocation was unclear, the method of randomisation was unclear, and all were double-blind (participant/investigator) trials. Five of the eight trials reported baseline comparability, with two studies demonstrating between-group comparability in both clinical and demographic characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1989</LINK>), two reporting differences in baseline severity (<LINK REF="REF-Guzzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzzo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 1998b</LINK>), and one with some significant differences in demographics and clinical severity (<LINK REF="REF-Andres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andres 2006</LINK>). Four of the eight RCTs were placebo-controlled and six included active controls.</P>
<P>Of the nine controlled studies, two were within-patient designs (<LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1989</LINK>), and the remainder were between-patient (parallel-group) designs.</P>
<P>Trials ranged in size from 10 to over 4000 participants. Treatment duration ranged from 2 weeks to 18 months. Loss to follow up averaged 9.5% (range = 0% to 63%). The mean age of participants was 48 (range = 15 to 85), and participants were more likely to be men (mean: 55%; range = 40 to 82%). In 12 studies, the baseline severity of participants was unclear. Remaining studies recruited participants with mild to moderate disease (N = 4), mild to severe disease (N = 4), moderate to severe disease (N = 6), and severe disease (N = 3).</P>
<P>Study treatments included vitamin D products (18/29), topical corticosteroids (12/29), coal tar (1/29), and tazarotene (2/29). Some comprised of combination regimens, such as vitamin D and corticosteroid (<LINK REF="REF-Lebwohl-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebwohl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vazquez_x002d_Lopez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazquez-Lopez 2004</LINK>) or tazarotene and corticosteroid (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2001</LINK>). No study of dithranol met the inclusion criteria for the review. Twenty-one of the studies assessed local adverse events, 18 assessed systemic effects, and 11 studies assessed both types.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Vitamin D products (N = 18)</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies evaluated local (N = 7) or systemic (N = 8) adverse effects associated with calcipotriol, or both. The rate of withdrawals due to local adverse events ranged from 4% to 14% and the rate of adverse events ranged between 20% and 41%; larger trials reported higher rates (weighted mean: 36%). In the 52-week trial by <LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2000</LINK>, facial irritation affected 30% of participants in the early stages of the trial, but the incidence declined over time. The incidence of systemic effects was less common: 5/8 studies found no significant effects. <LINK REF="REF-Bleiker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleiker 1998</LINK>'s study of inpatients with severe disease found 5/28 developed hypercalcaemia after receiving a dose greater than 5 g/kg. The study by <LINK REF="REF-Berth_x002d_Jones-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berth-Jones 1993</LINK>, in which 10 trial participants received a weekly dose of 100 g of calcipotriol for 4 weeks, found that urinary calcium increased significantly from baseline levels.</P>
<P>Four studies evaluated both local and systemic adverse effects associated with tacalcitol. The rate of withdrawals due to local adverse events ranged from 0% to 6%, and the rate of adverse events ranged between 10% and 21%. Three studies found no systemic effects. The study by <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2002c</LINK> found that over half of study participants with psoriasis affecting 10% to 20% of their body surface area exceeded the recommended daily dose of 5 g/day (up to 13 g daily), but there was no effect on calcium homeostasis. Systemic effects were identified in over half enrolled participants in the trial by <LINK REF="REF-Miyachi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyachi 2002</LINK>, but only 6/155 events were considered to be treatment-related in this uncontrolled study.</P>
<P>Three studies looked at adverse events associated with calcitriol (<LINK REF="REF-Brodell-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodell 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wishart-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wishart 1994</LINK>). One study examined the tolerability and systemic effects of calcitriol used as monotherapy (3 mcg/g ointment applied twice daily, as per licence) (<LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2001</LINK>). Three per cent of participants withdrew due to adverse events, and 15% reported local adverse events. The withdrawal rate due to systemic effects was low (0.4%), but 4 cases of hypercalcaemia were reported (N = 253). Mean daily use of calcitriol in this trial was 6 g (range = 1 to 24 g). In <LINK REF="REF-Brodell-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodell 2011b</LINK>, participants who had responded to treatment with clobetasol spray then received 8 weeks of maintenance treatment with calcitriol 3 mcg/g ointment twice-daily. Around 15% (35/235) of participants reported burning or stinging at the end of treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Wishart-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wishart 1994</LINK> tested the effects of high-dose calcitriol (15 mcg/g once-daily) on 3 groups of participants, with the quantity used proportional to the area affected The trial recruited participants with psoriasis affecting up to 30% of the body surface area. Mean daily drug use ranged from 74 to 306 mcg. The study did not observe any systemic adverse events, skin irritation, or 'clinically relevant' changes in vital signs, haematology, biochemistry, urine, or electrocardiograms.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Corticosteroids (N = 12)</HEADING>
<P>The 12 studies of adverse events associated with steroids adopted a range of different study designs. Four studies had no comparator group (<LINK REF="REF-Brodell-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodell 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimball-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimball 2008</LINK> (Phase II); <LINK REF="REF-Menter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menter 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vazquez_x002d_Lopez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazquez-Lopez 2004</LINK>).

The remaining study retrospectively compared 13 participants who had used topical corticosteroids for between 6 months and 12 years with a 'no steroid' group (N = 15).</P>
<P>Eight of the 12 corticosteroid studies assessed atrophy or preatrophy in people with psoriasis who were treated with topical steroids. Three studies explicitly described the methods used to assess atrophy, and some studies did not clearly state the numbers of participants affected by atrophy or its extent.</P>
<P>The retrospective study by <LINK REF="REF-Heng-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heng 1990</LINK> compared 13 participants who had used topical corticosteroids for between 6 months and 12 years with a 'no steroid' group: These 15 individuals had previously used tar, UVB, or were untreated. Light microscopy revealed no between-group differences. However, electron microscopy revealed multi-layered, fragmented, and disorganised basal laminae (the lining of the outer surface of the cell membrane) in the steroid group; this appeared to be correlated with duration of treatment. Fragmentation was not observed in the control group.</P>
<P>The 4-week study by <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1989</LINK> identified preatrophy in 20% of involved plaques, using a hand-held magnifying lens. Two long-term (26-week) studies of combination maintenance therapy with steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2001</LINK>) did not observe cutaneous atrophy, but neither study reported the assessment method. A 4-week trial of clobetasol propionate for scalp psoriasis assessed atrophy using an ultrasound probe (20 MHz) (<LINK REF="REF-Andres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andres 2006</LINK>). No case of cutaneous atrophy was detected in either the gel (which was left in) or shampoo formulations (which was rinsed out after 15 minutes). However, there was a significantly greater reduction in skin thickness in participants treated with the gel, compared to the shampoo group (<LINK REF="REF-Andres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andres 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>An uncontrolled study of clobetasol spray (<LINK REF="REF-Brodell-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodell 2011b</LINK>) detected atrophy in 7/285 participants after 4 weeks of treatment, though the study did not describe the assessment method. A randomised trial compared 2 weeks of treatment with clobetasol propionate foam (N = 253), clobetasol propionate ointment (N = 121), or placebo foam (N = 123) (<LINK REF="REF-Kimball-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimball 2008</LINK>, Phase III). The paper did not describe the assessment method. The trial found five cases of skin atrophy in the clobetasol foam group and one case in the placebo group, but the paper did not report the number of atrophy cases in the clobetasol ointment group. COBRA (Clobex Spray Community-Based Research Assessment) was an open-label 4-week study where 1421 people with psoriasis used clobetasol spray 0.05% twice daily as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Menter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menter 2007)</LINK>. Cases of telangiectasia, skin atrophy, or folliculitis each occurred in less than 1% of participants (the study did not report the numbers affected or the assessment method).</P>
<P>Four studies examined systemic effects associated with corticosteroids. The study by <LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1976</LINK> compared betamethasone valerate with clobetasol propionate. Quantities used by study participants were small (mean: 7 g/wk), and the study observed no pituitary-adrenal suppression. <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1987b</LINK> compared two 'superpotent' corticosteroids and identified temporary and reversible adrenal suppression in 20% (8/40) of study participants. In the study by <LINK REF="REF-Andres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andres 2006</LINK>, none of the 14 participants assigned to clobetasol propionate shampoo experienced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Conversely, 2 of the 12 participants in the gel group experienced HPA axis suppression. Neither formulation had an impact on ocular safety. In a phase II study (<LINK REF="REF-Kimball-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimball 2008</LINK>), higher levels of clobetasol were found in the plasma tests in ointment group than in the shampoo group, though the difference was not statistically significant.</P>

<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 2001</LINK> compared three types of maintenance therapy: tazarotene plus steroid, tazarotene plus placebo, and placebo alone. In this 6-month trial, there were no withdrawals due to adverse events, but 24% of participants in the tazarotene/steroid group and 29% of participants in the tazarotene/placebo group experienced adverse events. There were no adverse events in the placebo group, and the study did not assess systemic effects. <LINK REF="REF-Veraldi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veraldi 2006</LINK> evaluated short-contact treatment with tazarotene gel in 43 participants. The study drug was applied once daily, left for 20 minutes, and then rinsed off with water.

<P>Eight of the 177 studies included in the main review formally assessed quality of life (QoL) (<LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook_x002d_Bolden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cook-Bolden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guenther-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Guenther 2002 (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Guenther-2002-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Guenther 2002 (P)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saraceno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saraceno 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials used different QoL measures. <LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK> used the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI), and <LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2006</LINK> used the Quality of Life Index. In both measures, higher scores indicate poorer QoL. The trial by Guenther (2002) measured quality of life using the Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) and the EuroQOL (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS), reporting it in a separate publication (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 1998</LINK> also assessed quality of life using the Psoriasis Disability Index; <LINK REF="STD-Wall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 1998</LINK> also used the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Although four studies used the PDI to measure quality of life, they did not report data in sufficient detail to allow pooling, so we reported findings narratively. Four trials included participants with mild to moderate disease; the other three trials included participants with at least moderately severe disease. The number of participants ranged from 60 (<LINK REF="STD-Alora_x002d_Palli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Alora-Palli 2010</LINK>) to 828 (<LINK REF="STD-Guenther-2002-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Guenther 2002 (P)</LINK>), although PDI scores were obtained for only 51% of participants in this trial (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Saraceno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saraceno 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2006</LINK> used the Skindex-29, with <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Kerkhof-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Kerkhof 2006</LINK> also employing the SF-36.

Both treatments improved QoL relative to baseline, but there was no significant difference between the groups at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Participants were followed up for 6 weeks post-treatment; in the LCD group, quality of life continued to improve, but it deteriorated in the calcipotriol group. There was a significant between-group difference in the DLQI scores at the 18-week follow-up assessment. This QoL effect reflected the PASI and physician global assessments, which demonstrated significantly lower recurrence rates in the LCD group at 18 weeks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">EuroQOL (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS) (N = 1)</HEADING>
<P>The EQ5D is a generic quality of life measure. <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2004</LINK> reported quality of life data from the trial by Guenther 2002. The study presented the EQ5D scores in a non-standard method, making their interpretation problematic. EQ-VAS (scored from 1 to 100) supported findings from the PDI assessments, with all groups improving quality of life scores relative to baseline. However, the EQ-VAS score for the once-daily combined calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (plus placebo) group was higher (with a better quality of life) than the corresponding score in the twice-daily group. Relative to baseline, improvements in mean quality of life scores were statistically significant in all treatment groups, but the significance of between-group differences was not reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) (N = 4)</HEADING>
<P>In all four trials reporting this measure, there was an improvement in mean quality of life scores for participants in every group. The trial by Guenther 2002 found the greatest improvement (reduction in PDI from baseline, i.e. improvement in QoL) for twice-daily combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone (50%). Corresponding figures were as follows: once-daily combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone (plus placebo): 41%, calcipotriol twice daily: 31%, and placebo twice daily: 9%. In terms of absolute scores, the group using twice-daily combination treatment with calcipotriol and betamethasone had the best (lowest) quality of life score, followed by the once-daily combined treatment group, calcipotriol group, and placebo group. Relative to baseline, improvements in mean quality of life scores were statistically significant in all treatment groups, but the statistical significance of between-group differences was not reported. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hutchinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchinson 2000</LINK>, quality of life improved from baseline significantly more in the group treated with calcitriol relative to the dithranol group.

These analyses involve a range of modelling approaches and assumptions and have not been formally reviewed here, although they were part of our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002a</LINK>). Our updated review revealed no substantial variations in tolerability or effectiveness for most treatment comparisons, and no trials provided robust resource data on the consequences of managing treatment failure. Consequently, any economic models extrapolating beyond the duration of the trials may be largely speculative and uninformative. In the light of available data, a 'cost and consequences' approach, in which costs and outcomes are reported separately, may be most informative to clinical decision-makers. The relative short-term clinical performance of topical antipsoriatic treatments can be set against their reimbursed costs. While it is accepted that long-term sequelae in participants not responding to treatment may be very important when considering overall costs and benefits, there are no good comparative data on these costs with which to distinguish between treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002a</LINK>).</P>

In total, 11 studies enrolled 5541 participants, of which 39% were men and the mean age was 47.0 (range = 4 to 91). Study size ranged from 10 to 1281 participants, with the questionnaire surveys reporting the largest sample sizes. Studies covered four main issues. First, some reported methodological issues on the measurement of adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Balkrishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkrishnan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>). Second, some studies reported adherence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Balkrishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkrishnan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>). Third, seven studies considered reasons for non-adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gokdemir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gokdemir 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 1998c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological issues relating to adherence measurement and adherence rates</HEADING>
<P>Some studies used self-reported adherence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Gokdemir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gokdemir 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>). In these studies, which included short-term prospective trials and cross-sectional questionnaire surveys, rates varied between 61% and 72%. However, other studies adopted more objective assessment methods. The study by Fouere used a semistructured participant questionnaire: The PMAQ-3w scale (Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire) asked about strict adherence to prescribed regimen over the previous three days and previous weekend. Using this method, the study (<LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>) deemed just 27% of participants as 'compliant'. Some studies adopted a single-blind approach to assess electronic bottle caps (i.e. participants were unaware that bottles were fitted with electronic measuring devices) (<LINK REF="REF-Balkrishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkrishnan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 2007</LINK>). Known as a 'MEMS cap' (Medication Event Monitoring System), the medication bottle cap was fitted with a microprocessor to record the time/date of every opening of the bottle. When compared with participant logs, electronic methods suggested that adherence was considerably lower than rates reported by participants. For example, Balkrishnan's 1-week pilot study of 10 participants found that the adherence rate was 67% by electronic assessment compared with a self-reported rate of 92%. Carroll and colleagues took this pilot study forward using an 8-week trial of 30 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>). Adherence rates fell over time and averaged 55% over the study period when assessed using the MEMS cap. Twice-daily dosing was achieved on 39% of the treatment days.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Reasons for non-adherence</HEADING>
<P>Reasons for non-adherence comprised therapy characteristics (real or perceived), participants' clinical characteristics, and participants' demographic characteristics. Regarding therapy characteristics, the included studies identified the following as influences on adherence: efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 1998c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2000</LINK>), side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>), time for application (<LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gokdemir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gokdemir 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2000</LINK>), and 'messiness' (<LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 1998c</LINK>). Adherence was higher for topical therapy compared with systemic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>), but adherence rates also varied by type of topical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Fouere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouere 2005</LINK>). Disease severity was inversely related to adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>), although the direction of causality is unclear. Higher adherence rates were variously associated with female gender (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>), older age (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>), higher educational achievement (<LINK REF="REF-Gokdemir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gokdemir 2008</LINK>), and older age of disease onset (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>), but findings on marital status were mixed (<LINK REF="REF-Gokdemir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gokdemir 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaghloul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaghloul 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods to improve adherence</HEADING>

An educational programme designed to improve adherence had no impact on the effectiveness of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrandiz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrandiz 1998</LINK>). Van de Kerkhof's study comparing ointment/cream regimen with ointment-only treatment found no clear impact, with 51% of participants reporting better adherence with the cream/ointment option (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2001</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>This review analysed evidence from 177 studies that included 34,808 participants. We reported results separately for treatments of the body, inverse psoriasis, and psoriasis of the scalp.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatments for psoriasis of the body</HEADING>
<P>We analysed six placebo-controlled comparisons of treatments for psoriasis of the body. Most treatments were significantly more effective than placebo, with the equivalent pooled effect on a 6-point improvement (IAGI) scale ranging from 1.02 (potent corticosteroid) to 1.80 (very potent corticosteroid). Pooled effects indicated similar improvements for vitamin D analogues (1.03 points), dithranol (1.22 points), and combination therapy with vitamin D and potent corticosteroid (1.65) on a 6-point scale.</P>
<P>Amongst less frequently researched treatments, 13 were significantly more effective than placebo. For these treatments, the equivalent effect on a 6-point IAGI scale ranged from 0.55 (calcipotriol plus nicotinamide) to 3.40 (herbal skin care products). Tazarotene achieved an equivalent improvement of 0.99 on the 6-point IAGI scale. One small within-patient study found that tar was no more effective than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kanzler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kanzler 1993</LINK>). Findings from single studies should be treated with caution and regarded as requiring further evidence before guiding treatment.</P>
<P>We evaluated nine head-to-head comparisons. Findings from the comparisons of vitamin D against potent or very potent corticosteroids were mixed, and they varied depending on which vitamin D and which corticosteroid were analysed. Combination treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid was usually more effective than monotherapy with the same vitamin D, and it was always more effective than the same corticosteroid used alone.</P>
<P>Twelve complex regimens (i.e. treatment sequences that do not consist of a simple head-to-head comparison between two active treatments) were compared with vitamin D. Seven of the complex regimens were more effective than vitamin D, achieving an additional benefit of between 0.27 points and 0.72 points on an equivalent 6-point IAGI. A comparison of three long-term regimens found no significant difference in effect, but some were better tolerated (see below). These studies were interpreted independently, reflecting the differing management regimens. None of the studies presented have been replicated precisely. Therefore, while supportive evidence for findings can be drawn from similar studies, trial findings for complex regimens should be interpreted with caution when informing clinical decisions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatments for inverse psoriasis</HEADING>
<P>The review included four placebo-controlled comparisons of treatments for psoriasis of the sensitive areas of the body. As there were no effectiveness data for tacrolimus, the review evaluated benefits for three treatments. All three were significantly more effective than placebo, with the pooled effect on a 6-point IAGI scale ranging from 0.98 (pimecrolimus) to 3.25 (betamethasone valerate). Five treatments were compared head-to-head against vitamin D. Betamethasone valerate, combined treatment with calcipotriol and hydrocortisone, and calcitriol were all significantly more effective than calcipotriol alone. On an equivalent 6-point IAGI, these treatments achieved an additional benefit of 2.22, 0.33, and 0.67 points, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatments for psoriasis of the scalp</HEADING>
<P>We compared 11 treatments for scalp psoriasis with placebo. All but two were significantly more effective than vehicle alone; the most effective was the very potent corticosteroid, clobetasol propionate, which delivered a benefit of almost 2 points (1.88) on an equivalent 6-point IAGI scale. When compared head-to-head, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent and very potent corticosteroids. On an equivalent 6-point IAGI scale, the additional benefit was between 0.48 and 0.67 points. Combination therapy with calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate was significantly more effective than either product used alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Randomised evidence found that vitamin D was significantly more likely than potent corticosteroids to cause local adverse effects (15% versus 8%, P = 0.006), and participants were (borderline) more likely to withdraw for this reason (2% versus 1%, P = 0.059). These findings were supported by indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials. Participants tolerated combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp as well as potent corticosteroids and significantly better than vitamin D alone. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.</P>
<P>Studies of longer-term adverse events found that up to 40% of those using vitamin D analogues experienced cutaneous effects and that up to 14% of participants stopped using vitamin D analogues for this reason. There was some evidence to suggest that using vitamin D analogues at high doses could cause systemic adverse effects.</P>
<P>Two of the major cutaneous adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are dermal and epidermal atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Hengge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hengge 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK>). Only 25 of the 78 RCTs of corticosteroids included in the review explicitly assessed cutaneous atrophy, and in these the duration of the trials, skin sites assessed, and methods employed reduced the chance of detection. The studies either did not support the methods used to assess atrophy (14/25 trials), physicians undertook them (10/25), study participants self-reported them (5/25), or a combination of the aforementioned. Where physician assessments were conducted, the methods used were not explicit (for example, whether microscopy or ultrasound was used). Two of the 25 trials featured an independent 'adjudication committee', which assessed whether atrophy was likely to be treatment-related (<LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 2010</LINK>). Trial duration of the 25 trials was typically between 4 and 8 weeks, but there were 2 6-month studies (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 2010</LINK>) and 2 52-week studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials that assessed atrophy did not report whether or not any cases of atrophy occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Koo 2006</LINK>). Ten RCTs reported cases of atrophy, and these were trials of either very potent corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Cook_x002d_Bolden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cook-Bolden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decroix-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Decroix 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reygagne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reygagne 2005</LINK>) or combination treatment with potent corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Guenther-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Guenther 2002 (H)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kragballe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kragballe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2003-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2003 (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2003-_x0028_P_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2003 (P)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>). Three of the 10 were trials of scalp psoriasis (<LINK REF="STD-Cook_x002d_Bolden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cook-Bolden 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Poulin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reygagne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reygagne 2005</LINK>), all of which investigated clobetasol propionate.</P>
<P>Some studies reviewed as part of our search for additional studies of adverse events of longer-term use of topical corticosteroids revealed atrophy and damage to basal laminae, the extent of which appeared to be correlated with dosage and duration of use. Research of very potent steroids on the skin of normal volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Kao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 2003</LINK>). Longer-term use with topical retinoids caused cutaneous effects in around 30% of participants, but systemic effects were not assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Concordance/adherence</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-four of the 177 RCTs assessed adherence ('compliance'), and 26 trials reported findings. Trials used various methods such as self-report by participants, medication weight, and treatment completion. Most of the 26 studies that reported findings on adherence found it to be suboptimal. However, Gupta has argued that the relevant notion is concordance rather than compliance or adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2007</LINK>). Whereas adherence implies that people comply with clinicians' prescribed treatment, concordance involves a negotiated doctor-patient agreement about the treatment regimen. Van de Kerkhof's survey of over 800 European people with psoriasis found that some chose not to comply, preferring to apply the 'minimum' dose needed to achieve the effect they wanted (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Kerkhof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Kerkhof 2000</LINK>). If prescribed regimens reflected the wishes of the person with psoriasis, 'adherence' rates might be expected to rise. Nonetheless, poor adherence to treatment regimens is likely to impair the effectiveness of treatment.</P>
<P>The review identified one study that used an educational programme to improve adherence rates in people with psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrandiz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrandiz 1998</LINK>). This study found no statistically significant difference in outcomes, a finding which contrasts with evidence concerning an educational programme for atopic dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Cork-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cork 2003</LINK>). However, whereas the programme in the <LINK REF="REF-Ferrandiz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrandiz 1998</LINK> study provided education about the disease, the study by Cork involved specialist nurses teaching methods for applying topical treatments. Therefore, the findings from <LINK REF="REF-Ferrandiz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrandiz 1998</LINK> may not generalise to reflect the value of other educational programmes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>In four comparisons, we used sensitivity analysis to explore whether within-patient versus between-patient study designs were associated with different effect sizes. When comparing within-patient and between-patient study designs, our review found no statistically significant difference in treatment effect size. If within-patient studies featured some correlation, due to systemic effects or cross contamination, then one would expect systematically smaller effect sizes from within-patient studies. If there is no correlation, then one would expect the variance to be smaller (as other sources of between-patient variation have been removed) but the effect size to be similar. We found no evidence to support a correlation for within-patient studies, and variances were similar for within and between-patient studies (<LINK REF="TBL-27" TYPE="TABLE">Table 27</LINK>), supporting the pooling of these, although it is accepted that within-patient designs are 'underweighted' in meta-analyses.</P>
<P>In the placebo-controlled studies of vitamin D products, there was little difference when comparing within-patient and between-patient study findings. On average, within-patient studies identified a slightly greater effect than between-patient studies (mean difference: 0.36 points on a 6-point IAGI scale). For placebo-controlled potent corticosteroids, there was a more pronounced difference in favour of within-patient studies (mean difference: 0.55 points on a 6-point IAGI scale). In the case of very potent corticosteroids, the mean effect relative to placebo was slightly larger in the between-patient studies (mean difference: 0.07 points on a 6-point IAGI scale), and the analysis of vitamin D against potent corticosteroid was similar in this respect (a small positive difference in favour of between-patient studies). These non-statistically significant differences may be chance findings.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-20 13:43:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>All included trials were randomised, but only 47 studies (27%) clearly reported the method used to randomise participants (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Just 15 trials (9%) adequately concealed treatment allocation, but most (74%) masked participants to treatment. Of the 177 studies assessed, 151 reported loss to follow up, and 143 demonstrated that groups were comparable at baseline. Based on the 100 studies that reported assessable data on baseline severity, it was apparent that a wide range of severity was included within and between trials. If the PASI is unreliable for mild-to-moderate disease (PASI scores less than 10) (<LINK REF="REF-Brownell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownell 2007</LINK>), it is possible that some trials may have contributed unreliable PASI data to this review.</P>
<P>Trials varied in their treatment duration and in their outcome measures (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK> section for details). One reason for the variation in trial treatment duration is that the time taken for an intervention to be effective differs between treatments. The analyses and forest plots do not provide information on treatment duration, but this is an important consideration for clinical decisions. Trials also used different outcome measures; for example, only 113 studies reported data on the IAGI or IGA, and 65 studies reported PASI data. In order to maximise the number of studies contributing data for a particular treatment comparison, we used a combined end point that incorporated different outcome measures. This approach is not ideal; although all outcome measures essentially assess redness, thickness, and scaling (and sometimes area of psoriatic involvement), they differ in their construct. Therefore, the composite end points should be seen as indicative rather than definitive.</P>
<P>Medical text books commonly document the risk of skin atrophy and tachyphylaxis (diminution of the effects of a drug with continual use) as problems associated with topical corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Bos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2008</LINK>). Randomised evidence reported in this review suggests that maintenance regimens using intermittent dosing are safe and effective, and no RCT included in the review detected a statistically significant difference in systemic effects. However, the RCTs did not clearly report the methods employed (e.g. whether the investigator used ultrasound) and may have reduced the chance of detection. We undertook a separate search for longer-term studies of adverse events, which identified 12 relevant studies of corticosteroids. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of design, assessment methods, comparators considered, and doses used, so we did not pool data (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Eight studies assessed atrophy, and six found some evidence of basal damage and atrophy. We identified no studies reporting adequate data on tachyphylaxis, despite including this term in our searches.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-02-20 13:45:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>There are a number of limitations to this review. First, one author extracted data and a second checked it. Ideally, two authors should extract data independently (<LINK REF="REF-NHSCRD-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSCRD 2001</LINK>). However, this approach was not feasible for this review because of funding constraints. Second, requests for unpublished data from trialists and sponsors were of variable success; requests were more likely to be successful when made for more recently published studies, products still on patent, or both.</P>
<P>This review included 19 comparisons with 10 potential outcomes, so multiple analyses may be expected to generate occasional chance findings. Thus, greater importance is attached where supportive findings are found from placebo-controlled and head-to-head studies as well as linked therapeutic modalities.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-02-20 13:47:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review by Ashcroft and colleagues focused on head-to-head trials of one vitamin D analogue, calcipotriol (<LINK REF="REF-Ashcroft-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashcroft 2000a</LINK>). Based on data from 37 studies with over 6000 participants, the review found that calcipotriol was at least as effective as potent topical corticosteroids and more effective than calcitriol, tacalcitol, coal tar, and short contact dithranol. Our review generally supported these findings. However, we found no significant difference for the comparison of calcipotriol and calcitriol (SMD -0.41; 95% CI -1.46 to 0.64), a finding based on 2 head-to-head trials with 261 participants. Our review also found that calcitriol is more efficacious than calcipotriol when used for inverse psoriasis, and it is also better tolerated. Our findings on the effectiveness of short-contact dithranol compared with calcipotriol were mixed, but physicians and people with psoriasis may be interested to know that inpatient treatment with dithranol appears more effective than calcipotriol (<LINK REF="STD-Monastirli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Monastirli 2000</LINK>). Our review also supported findings from the review by <LINK REF="REF-Ashcroft-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashcroft 2000a</LINK> that although calcipotriol caused significantly more skin irritation than potent topical corticosteroids, skin irritation rarely led to withdrawal of calcipotriol treatment.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Afifi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afifi 2005</LINK> concluded that combined treatment with steroids and vitamin D analogues or topical retinoids appeared the most promising current treatment on account of its superior efficacy and favourable side-effects profile. However, longer-term adverse effects were not addressed by this review. In contrast, the review by <LINK REF="REF-Bruner-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruner 2003a</LINK> focused on adverse effects. This review supported our findings that there is little robust evidence on longer-term adverse effects; therefore, concluding that since clearance is not a realistic expectation, "reasonable goals" are needed to avoid increasing the risk of cutaneous and systemic side-effects through over use.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-25 15:15:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-25 15:15:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Evidence from large numbers of trials indicates that most of the topical treatments tested in the trials reviewed here alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis. However, it was not possible to assess the performance of treatments at different levels of severity of psoriasis.</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that vitamin D products are more effective than emollient alone. Potent and very potent corticosteroids are also effective, and very potent corticosteroids are more effective than either potent corticosteroids or vitamin D products. The effectiveness of dithranol and tazarotene appears to be similar to that of vitamin D products. Although vitamin D and corticosteroids are equally effective for treating psoriasis of the body, corticosteroids appear to be more effective than vitamin D for treating psoriasis of the scalp. Combined treatment of vitamin D with corticosteroid is more effective than either vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D is more effective than coal tar, but findings on the relative effectiveness of vitamin D and dithranol were mixed. Occlusion enhances the effectiveness of vitamin D, as does twice-daily rather than once-daily application.</P>
<P>Compared with vitamin D alone, combined therapy that uses two products separately (vitamin D in the morning and corticosteroid at night) can achieve similar effects and be as well tolerated as using a combined product. However, some corticosteroids seem to perform better than others when used separately (see <LINK REF="CMP-012.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-012.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.9</LINK>), and disease severity may also affect treatment performance, though poor reporting of baseline severity in trials means that we cannot confirm this. Use of a combined product may also enhance concordance, and there is evidence to suggest that adherence is higher when application time is shorter.</P>
<P>Potent corticosteroids are less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, and treatment with corticosteroids is less likely to result in discontinued use because of these adverse events. Tazarotene is more likely than emollient to cause local adverse events. Our review found no difference between placebo and any other topical treatment in the assessment of systemic adverse events. However, this may reflect an absence of evidence (trials failing to appropriately assess these events over adequate time periods) rather than being evidence of absence.</P>
<P>Although current evidence demonstrates that topical steroids are as effective as and at least as well tolerated as vitamin D analogues, concern remains about the potential safety problems associated with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Bos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2008</LINK>). Concerns include the risk of rebound (a worsening of disease following treatment discontinuation), skin atrophy (skin thinning), and tachyphylaxis (decreasing response to the drug) after long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Hengge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hengge 2006</LINK>). Methods to assess rebound have been developed and should be used in future research (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 2006</LINK>). Regarding skin thinning, one problem with psoriasis is that the skin is very thick and a goal of therapy is to reduce the thickness of lesional (epidermal) skin. Damage to the surrounding normal skin may occur, and for that reason, people should use topical corticosteroids for limited periods or sparingly in delicate areas, such as the face or folds of the skin.</P>
<P>Although topical corticosteroids have been in use for about 50 years, there is a surprising lack of relevant evidence addressing steroid-associated skin dermal atrophy in people with chronic plaque psoriasis requiring long-term treatment. It is improbable that short-term (less than three weeks) courses of topical corticosteroids cause dermal skin atrophy, except in delicate areas such as the face and flexures (groin, axillae, inframammary). However, treatment may be long-term and continuous for people with more severe chronic psoriasis. Current assessments of cutaneous dermal atrophy within trials have largely been limited to clinical observation or symptom and sign reporting by trial participants (which will only detect severe atrophy of the dermis). More sensitive and reliable methods, such as high frequency ultrasound, are routinely available (<LINK REF="REF-Cossmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cossmann 2006</LINK>). Dermal atrophy might be monitored in part if trials routinely adopted more robust methods, such as high frequency ultrasound, to assess dermal skin atrophy skin-thinning, providing useful information for patients and clinicians. </P>
<P>Excessive use of topical corticosteroids can also cause a substantial thinning of the epidermis (<LINK REF="REF-Kao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 2003</LINK>). However, thickening of the epidermis is part of the problem in psoriasis and so thinning of the epidermis (not dermis) that has been caused by topical corticosteroids may be of benefit in psoriasis. Evidence drawn from healthy volunteers or severe long-term cases cannot be generalised. Specifically, evidence is required concerning the frequency and spectrum of atrophy in people with chronic psoriasis requiring long-term treatment.</P>
<P>Topical vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol, tacalcitol) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) do not cause cutaneous atrophy. The issue may become a historical one if newer safer steroids, currently being developed and evaluated for atopic dermatitis, subsequently demonstrate efficacy and safety in chronic plaque psoriasis.</P>
<P>We found no evidence on tachyphylaxis, but if treatment response were to decline, this could lead to over-use, increasing the risk of percutaneous absorption. As the evidence base on longer-term adverse effects in psoriasis is inadequate, the preferences of people with psoriasis and their attitudes to these perceived risks should inform treatment choice. Further research is required to inform approaches to long-term maintenance.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-20 13:57:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Evidence showing that treatments improve the symptoms of psoriasis has focused mainly on treatments with relatively short duration. Although improving, there is still relatively limited randomised evidence to tell us about the long-term effect of using these treatments; good quality head-to-head evidence is therefore needed to quantify and compare long-term adverse events and to explore the feasibility of long-term treatment. There are important sources of heterogeneity in currently available trial findings, which it is not possible to explore in anything other than a qualitative sense. For example, the properties of the vehicle preparation are known to deliver wide variation in response to treatment. This is important when interpreting the findings of this review. The value of the active ingredient may be worth one point on a six-point (IAGI) scale, but possibly one to two points are also being contributed by the vehicle. However, an analysis of vehicle performance was outside the scope of the review. Trial publications included in this review span 45 years. Reporting standards within these trials are generally suboptimal by today's standards, and it would be useful to ensure that current trials adhere to CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) standards to help future reviews to interpret findings appropriately. For example, where trials enrol participants with a wide range of baseline severity, stratifying the randomisation by baseline severity would be a useful design feature. We are not aware of studies that have adopted this approach. Trialists might usefully consider including more homogeneous participant groups in terms of severity, so that the clinical implications of findings are clearer.</P>
<P>Given the importance of safety to patients and to resolve clinical uncertainties, it would be valuable to obtain reliable data on the safety of corticosteroids used long-term at recommended doses, including step-down or intermittent management. Historically, these uncertainties have been driven by unrepresentative case series of non-standard use of steroids. Given the variety of methods used to assess atrophy and other sequelae, it would be valuable to reach clinical consensus about reliable assessment methods (<LINK REF="REF-Cossmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cossmann 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>There are some differences between the protocol and the review.</P>
<P>1. In our protocol, we stated our intention to adjust for the precision of findings from within-patient studies for within-patient correlation. However, we were unsuccessful in our attempts to identify estimates of this correlation from published or unpublished sources. We therefore undertook sensitivity analysis to investigate differences between within-patient and between-patient studies.</P>
<P>2. In our protocol, we listed three primary outcome measures for data extraction. In the review, we also included the Patient Assessment of Global Improvement.</P>
<P>3. In our protocol, we stated that there would be no language restrictions when searching for publications. However, the search for longer-term studies of adverse events included a restriction to publications in English.</P>
<P>4. In our protocol, we stated our intention that studies meeting only some of the inclusion criteria stated above would be listed as excluded studies. However, as large numbers of studies would need to be listed, this was not feasible. Therefore, we listed as excluded studies only those studies that we deemed potentially eligible for inclusion <I>and</I> for which we retrieved full papers, but which we subsequently found to fail to meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>5. Throughout the text, we replaced all references to vitamin D3 with 'vitamin D analogues'.</P>
<P>6. Under <LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK>, we relaxed the condition that studies were of at least two weeks duration. In the same section, we added the following sentence: "If no useful effectiveness, withdrawal or adverse events data were available, either from the published paper or from sponsors or trialists, we excluded the study."</P>
<P>7. Under <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>, we added the sentence "The potency of topical corticosteroids was based on classifications from a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2002b</LINK>)".</P>
<P>8. Under <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>, <LINK TAG="STUDY_SELECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Selection of studies</LINK>, and our explanations of the studies excluded, we added the searches for studies exploring adverse events and compliance studies.</P>
<P>9. Under <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>/<LINK TAG="DATA_EXTRACTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data extraction and management</LINK>, we added the phrase 'between-patient design'.</P>
<P>10. Under <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>/<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>, we removed the phrase 'in each arm'.</P>
<P>11. Under <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>/<LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK>/'Summarising primary outcomes with standardised mean differences', we revised the text in this section to include the PAGI outcome and to provide a fuller explanation of our analytic approach.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This was partially demonstrated (de Korte 2008). There were significantly more men in the dithranol group (72% versus 46%). However, de Korte does not provide data on 6 participants. If all these participants are assumed to be of the gender that minimises between group differences, the difference is almost statistically significant at the 5% level (= 0.0502; Fisher's exact test). This may indicate a flawed randomisation process, or it may be chance. The primary reference does not report variance around mean PASI baseline estimates, so comparability was unclear.</P>
