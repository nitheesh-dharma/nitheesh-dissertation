<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Immunotherapy by allergen injections for seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever')</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever') is a global health problem and its prevalence has increased considerably in the last two decades. Treatment includes allergen avoidance, drugs such as antihistamine tablets and nasal sprays, and immunotherapy (vaccination). For those patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled despite drug treatment, specific allergen immunotherapy (SIT) is advised. </P>
<P>Specific allergen immunotherapy is most commonly administered as subcutaneous (under the skin) injections by specialists requiring a building-up period followed by a maintenance period of three to five years. Immunotherapy may also be delivered by the oral, nasal or sublingual route and these will be studied in separate Cochrane reviews, as will immunotherapy for perennial (all year round) allergic rhinitis. In this review we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of injection immunotherapy, compared with placebo, for reducing symptoms and the need for medication. </P>
<P>We identified randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials of specific allergen immunotherapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to tree, grass or weed pollens. Fifty-one studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. In total there were 2871 participants (1645 in the treatment groups and 1226 in the placebo), each receiving on average 18 injections. The duration of treatment varied from three days to three years. </P>
<P>This review has shown that injection immunotherapy in suitably selected patients with hay fever results in significant reductions in symptom scores and medication use. Injection immunotherapy has a known and relatively low risk of severe adverse events. We found no long-term consequences from adverse events and no fatalities. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is the most common of the allergic diseases. Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis and advances in its pharmacological treatment, its prevalence has increased worldwide. For patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled despite medical treatment, allergen injection immunotherapy is advised. An allergen-based treatment may reduce symptoms, the need for medication and modify the natural course of this disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous specific allergen immunotherapy, compared with placebo, for reducing symptoms and medication requirements in seasonal allergic rhinitis patients.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1 2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), Pre-MEDLINE, KOREAMED, INDMED, LILACS, PAKMEDINET, Scisearch, <I>m</I>RCT and the National Research Register. The date of the last search was February 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All studies identified by the searches were assessed to identify randomised controlled trials involving participants with symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and proven allergen sensitivity, treated with subcutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy or corresponding placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent authors identified all studies reporting double-blind, placebo controlled randomised trials of specific immunotherapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to tree, grass or weed pollens. Two authors independently performed quality assessment of studies. Data from identified studies were abstracted onto a standard extraction sheet and subsequently entered into RevMan 4.2.8. Analysis was performed using the Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) method and a random-effects model; P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The primary outcome measures were symptom scores, medication use, quality of life and adverse events. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We retrieved 1111 publications of which 51 satisfied our inclusion criteria. In total there were 2871 participants (1645 active, 1226 placebo), each receiving on average 18 injections. Duration of immunotherapy varied from three days to three years. Symptom score data from 15 trials were suitable for meta-analysis and showed an overall reduction in the immunotherapy group (SMD -0.73 (95% CI -0.97 to -0.50, P &lt; 0.00001)). Medication score data from 13 trials showed an overall reduction in the immunotherapy group (SMD of -0.57 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.33, p&lt;0.00001)). Clinical interpretation of the effect size is difficult. Adrenaline was given in 0.13% (19 of 14085 injections) of those on active treatment and in 0.01% (1 of 8278 injections) of the placebo group for treatment of adverse events. There were no fatalities. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review has shown that specific allergen injection immunotherapy in suitably selected patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis results in a significant reduction in symptom scores and medication use. Injection immunotherapy has a known and relatively low risk of severe adverse events. We found no long-term consequences from adverse events.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-25 16:50:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is a significant public health concern in many countries and particularly so in the economically-developed world affecting up to 30% of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bauchau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauchau 2004</LINK>) and up to 40% of children (<LINK REF="REF-ISAAC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISAAC 1998</LINK>). The prevalence of allergic rhinitis has increased considerably in the last two decades, particularly in countries with a Western lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mygind-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mygind 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allergic rhinitis has traditionally been categorised as being either 'seasonal', in which case pollen or moulds are the usual trigger, or 'perennial', in which case house dust mites or pet dander allergens are typically responsible, although in the tropics perennial symptoms can be caused by pollen and mould. However, allergic rhinitis is becoming increasingly assessed according to the frequency of symptoms (i.e. intermittent or persistent) and their severity and impact on patients' quality of life (i.e. mild or moderate/severe) (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is "a symptomatic disorder of the nose induced by an IgE-mediated inflammation after allergen exposure of the membranes lining the nose" (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2001</LINK>). The allergen provokes production of IgE antibodies which bind to mast cells releasing histamine and other inflammatory mediators. This pathway is responsible for immediate symptoms which can begin within a few minutes of exposure to the allergen. IgE production is triggered by T-lymphocytes which also control production of eosinophils and other inflammatory mediators responsible for the delayed reactions occurring a few hours after exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1994</LINK>). Whilst the mechanism of immunotherapy is not completely understood, the most plausible explanation is that immunotherapy modifies the immune response by producing less of the 'harmful' antibodies (specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E) and more of the 'protective' antibodies called IgG (<LINK REF="REF-Frew-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frew 1993</LINK>). Immunotherapy acts on specific cells called T cells, to modify their peripheral and mucosal responses to allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Till-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Till 2004</LINK>). This mechanism involves the switching from Th2 response (allergic response) in favour of Th1 response (non-allergic response) (<LINK REF="REF-Till-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Till 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis include nasal itching, sneezing, watery nasal discharge, blocked nose and eye symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Durham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durham 1998</LINK>). Treatment options include allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy. Recommended drug treatments include antihistamines, topical nasal steroids, anti-leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilisers and, in some cases, a short course of systemic steroids or decongestants. For patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled despite these treatments, allergen injection immunotherapy is advised (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malling 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Allergen immunotherapy by injection (also known as desensitisation or hyposensitisation) consists of an induction course of injections of increasing doses of the allergen extract, usually given weekly or fortnightly. The maintenance phase of maximum dosage injections usually lasts between two to three years (<LINK REF="REF-Frew-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frew 1993</LINK>). Immunotherapy can also be delivered through the nasal, oral or sublingual (under the tongue) route; its efficacy by the sublingual method of delivery is the subject of a separate recently completed review (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2005</LINK>). The effectiveness of immunotherapy by the oral and nasal route will also be studied in separate Cochrane reviews. Although injections can consist of mixed allergen extracts, there is some evidence that this can lead to degradation of the allergenic compounds, reducing the effect of the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Dreborg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreborg 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Specific allergen immunotherapy (SIT) for hay fever is widely considered to be effective where grass pollen (<LINK REF="STD-Varney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Varney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malling 2001</LINK>), ragweed, and birch pollen (<LINK REF="REF-Viander-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viander 1978</LINK>) are causal agents, and there is evidence that its efficacy may continue for many years beyond the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Mosbech-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mosbech 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durham-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durham 1999b</LINK>). However, there are concerns over its safety. In 1986 a report by the UK Committee on the Safety of Medicines (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1986</LINK>) suggested that deaths and adverse reactions from allergen immunotherapy were increasing. The UK Committee on the Safety of Medicines stipulated that this treatment be given only where full resuscitation facilities were available and that patients be observed for at least two hours after its administration. Although observation time was later reduced to one hour (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1994</LINK>), these restrictions effectively prevented administration of allergen immunotherapy in primary care in the UK, with the effect that availability was severely curtailed. </P>
<P>Not all sufferers are suitable candidates for this therapy. Some 13% to 38% of people with seasonal allergic rhinitis also suffer from asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Aberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aberg 1989</LINK>) and asthma sufferers have been identified as a group with a particularly high risk of adverse reactions and death from immunotherapy. For these reasons, many countries do not recommend immunotherapy in people with asthma, which excludes a large proportion of the population which might otherwise benefit. Despite the reduced availability of immunotherapy in the UK and Scandinavian countries, immunotherapy is still freely practiced in parts of Europe and in North America (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CSACI-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSACI 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>There are many issues in immunotherapy which merit further investigation such as the possible long-term benefits of immunotherapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis or the suitability of this treatment for patients who also suffer from asthma. In this review, however, we focus on two key and fundamental questions: we intend to examine the efficacy and efficacy-risk profile of pollen immunotherapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Three independent authors (MC, BA, MJ) checked titles and abstracts identified from the searches. Both authors obtained the full text of all studies of possible relevance for assessment. The authors (MC, BA, MJ) read all abstracts and decided which trials met the inclusion criteria and graded their methodological quality. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion between the authors with recourse to a third reviewer (AS or SD) for arbitration where necessary. Authors were contacted for clarification where necessary. Further information was sought from study authors when needed. The selected studies were then further evaluated for methodological quality to select those suitable for meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Each of the suitable reports were read in detail by MC, BA and MJ and relevant details were abstracted on to a standard extraction sheet (covering study type and methodology; number and description of subjects; details of type, dosage and time schedule/ duration of intervention; type, timing and measurement method of outcomes). Concealment of allocation and blinding of study participants and investigators was assessed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Methodological quality was assessed using the following approach:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Concealment of allocation to the intervention or placebo arm of trial </HEADING>
<P>A - Adequate; for example, centralised randomisation by a central office.<BR/>B - Unclear; list or table or apparently adequate concealment but no other information in trial.<BR/>C - Unmet; alternation, days of the week, any allocation that is potentially transparent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Attrition bias </HEADING>
<P>A - Adequate; trials where an intention to treat analysis is possible and drop out rate was less than 20% after one year in all groups.<BR/>B - Unclear; trials where drop out rate was more than 20% after one year or large differences in drop out rates between groups were observed.<BR/>C - Unmet; No reporting on drop out rates and intention to treat analysis not possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias </HEADING>
<P>A - Adequate; trials in which blinding of investigators assessing outcomes was adequate.<BR/>B - Unclear; trials in which blinding of investigators was not described adequately.<BR/>C - Unmet; trials in which blinding of investigators was clearly not performed.</P>
<P>Trials which fell into allocation concealment category C were excluded from the analysis and the remaining studies were given an overall score using the following criteria:<BR/>A - Low risk of bias, where all criteria were 'Adequate'.<BR/>B - Medium risk of bias, where one or more criteria were 'Unclear' and the rest were 'Adequate'.<BR/>C - High risk of bias, where one or more criteria were unmet.</P>
<P>Study quality was used in a sensitivity analysis. Due to prior familiarity with the content of most studies, authors names were not removed before assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Outcome data, extracted from the included studies, were entered into RevMan 4.2.8 for statistical analysis. All outcome data on efficacy that were analysed were continuous (symptom scores, medication scores) but authors used a wide variety of scoring systems and scales for symptoms (most frequently a daily quantification of nasal, ocular and chest symptoms entered on a diary card and subsequently totalled and averaged) and rescue medication use (typically a daily score reflecting use of oral antihistamines tablets, eye drops and nasal sprays entered on a diary card and subsequently totalled and averaged).</P>
<P>Adverse reactions (dichotomous outcome) were recorded by people or by injection, as local or systemic reactions. Systemic reactions were graded according to time of onset (early within 30 minutes and late after 30 minutes) and severity of reaction. For assessing the severity of systemic reactions we followed the grading system proposed in the Position Paper of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology on Immunotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Malling-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malling 1993</LINK>):</P>
<P>Grade 1: Non-specific reactions: Reactions probably not IgE-mediated; i.e. discomfort, headache, arthralgia, etc.<BR/>Grade 2: Mild systemic reactions: Mild rhinitis and/or asthma (peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) over 60% of predicted or of the personal best values) responding adequately to antihistamines or inhaled B2-agonists.<BR/>Grade 3: Non life-threatening systemic reactions: Urticaria, angioedema, or severe asthma (PEFR under 60% of predicted or of personal best values) responding well to treatment.<BR/>Grade 4: Anaphylactic shock: Rapidly evoked reaction of itching, flushing, erythema, bronchial obstruction, etc. requiring intensive treatment.</P>
<P>Two key analyses were carried out:<BR/>An examination of the efficacy of immunotherapy during the period of the treatment;<BR/>An examination of the risks of serious adverse reactions due to treatment.</P>
<P>Quantitative analyses of outcomes were presented on an intention-to-treat basis. Meta-analysis was performed, where appropriate, using a random-effects model to obtain summary statistics for the overall efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy. We planned to express categorical data as odds ratios or relative risks (with 95% confidence intervals). For continuous data, the Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) was calculated (with 95% Confidence Intervals). SMD standardises the outcome for each individual study to the effect size found in terms of the standard deviation observed (in the study). The use of SMD is generally the method used for pooling data from different scales. Chi-squared tests were performed to assess heterogeneity between studies, with a P value &lt;0.05 indicating significant differences between studies.</P>
<P>The following subgroups of comparisons between active and placebo treated subjects were proposed prior to undertaking the data analysis:</P>
<P>1 - SYMPTOM SCORES<BR/>2 - MEDICATION SCORES<BR/>3 - SYMPTOM AND MEDICATION SCORES<BR/>4 - NASAL SYMPTOM SCORES<BR/>5 - BRONCHIAL SYMPTOM SCORES<BR/>6 - OCULAR SYMPTOM SCORES<BR/>7 - GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT<BR/>8 - RHINOCONJUNCTIVITIS QUALITY OF LIFE<BR/>9 - ADVERSE EVENTS<BR/>9.1 - LOCAL REACTION<BR/>9.1.1 - Local reaction not requiring treatment<BR/>9.1.2 - Local reaction requiring treatment<BR/>9..2 - SYSTEMIC REACTION<BR/>9.2.1 - Early systemic reaction grade 2 (&lt; 30 minutes)<BR/>9.2.2 - Early systemic reaction grade 3 (&lt; 30 minutes)<BR/>9.2.3 - Early systemic reaction grade 4 (&lt; 30 minutes)<BR/>9.2.4 - Late systemic reaction (&gt; 30 minutes)<BR/>9.2.5 - Systemic reaction - severity and time of onset not specified<BR/>10 - ADRENALINE USE<BR/>11 - COST<BR/>12 - SERUM ANTIBODY LEVELS<BR/>12.1 - Specific IgG<BR/>12.2 - Specific IgG-4<BR/>12.3 - Specific IgE<BR/>13 - SPECIFIC ALLERGEN CHALLENGES<BR/>13.1 - Nasal Challenge<BR/>13.2 - Conjunctival Challenge<BR/>13.3 - Skin Challenge<BR/>13.4 - Bronchial Challenge<BR/>14 - DEATHS</P>
<P>Where appropriate, additional analyses were performed according to subgroup.</P>
<P>Characteristics of the treatments and participants with highest and lowest relative risk of adverse reaction were described.</P>
<P>Tests for heterogeneity were performed and if found to be significant, possible explanations were sought through examination of study quality and type of immunotherapy.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Our searches identified 1111 abstracts of potential relevance, of which 276 were selected for in-depth appraisal of full text papers. Fifty-one full papers satisfied our inclusion criteria. The methods, participants, interventions and outcomes of the included studies are listed in the table of Characteristics of Included Studies. In total there were 2871 participants: 1645 active and 1226 placebo, each receiving on average 18 injections. All studies included patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Symptom score data from 15 trials were suitable for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Six studies specified that patients did not experience co-existent asthma; in 27 studies patients had mild to moderate seasonal allergic asthma; 18 studies did not specify the asthmatic status of their participants. </P>
<P>A wide range of allergens were administered in these studies: ragweed (12), mixed grass (16), timothy (5), parietaria (6), birch (4), orchard (2), cedar (3), bermuda (1), juniperus ashei (1) and cocos (1). </P>
<P>The types of vaccines used were extracts (38), allergoids (12) and non-specified (1).</P>
<P>The duration of maintenance treatment and the period of follow up varied considerably between studies, largely reflecting pre-seasonal, co-seasonal and post-seasonal administration. Duration of immunotherapy varied from three days (minimum duration) to three years (maximum duration). Six studies did not mention the duration of treatment.</P>
<P>It was not possible from most of the studies to determine accurately the dose of allergen given in terms of micrograms of major allergen. Doses given were quantified in many different units including BU, PNU, BU, SQ-U, mcg Ag, SE-U, Aueq, SU/ml, TU, wt/vol and HEP.</P>
<P>The reasons for excluding the 230 studies were:</P>
<P>Not a double-blind randomised placebo controlled study (23);<BR/>Not a double-blind placebo controlled study (16);<BR/>Not a double-blind study (7);<BR/>Not a placebo controlled study (58);<BR/>Not a randomised study (6);<BR/>Route other than subcutaneous (12);<BR/>Single or low dose immunotherapy (5);<BR/>Not a specific immunotherapy study (25);<BR/>No standardised allergen extracts used (4);<BR/>Rinkel method (very low-dose co-seasonal immunotherapy) (2);<BR/>No allergen extract used (4);<BR/>Other outcomes investigated (28);<BR/>Comparison of two different immunotherapy preparations (3);<BR/>Not a seasonal allergic rhinitis study (11);<BR/>Patients were asthmatics, not rhinitics (6);<BR/>Peptide immunotherapy used (1);<BR/>Review article (4);<BR/>Follow-up study (1);<BR/>Some patients had previous immunotherapy (4);<BR/>Survey study (1);<BR/>Withdrawal of treatment study (3);<BR/>Data included in another paper (5);<BR/>Insufficient data for analysis (1).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All included studies were double-blind placebo controlled trials of parallel group design. Concealment of treatment, based on statements made by the original authors, was considered adequate in all studies. Blinding of study subjects and investigators was almost universally maintained by use of similar placebo preparations. Overall score for methodological quality was found to be 'low risk of bias' in 42 studies, 'medium risk of bias' in five studies, 'high risk of bias' in one study, and undetermined in three studies. Full details, including quality scores, are set out in the table of 'Characteristics of Included Studies'.</P>

<P>The decision to pool studies in the following meta-analyses, despite evidence of heterogeneity, was taken as it was clear for all outcomes that all of the pooled studies showed a consistent direction of effect. We believe the pooled results give an idea of the direction and size of the effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Symptom scores</HEADING>
<P>Most of the included studies reported symptom scores, recorded in patient diaries, as a primary outcome measure. Data obtained in this way are almost always non-normally distributed (skewed) and therefore many studies reported results as median values. Strenuous attempts were made to obtain means and standard deviations direct from authors and values were only included after data were obtained. Only 15 studies met all criteria for symptom score meta-analysis; these included active immunotherapy subjects n = 597 and placebo subjects n = 466 (<LINK REF="STD-Balda-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bodtger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bodtger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousquet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bousquet 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brewczynski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brewczynski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corrigan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Corrigan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drachenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drachenberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frew-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frew 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jutel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jutel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meriney-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Meriney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortolani-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ortolani 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortolani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ortolani 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Varney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2001</LINK> (Delta values were used for this study); <LINK REF="STD-Zenner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zenner 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combined Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) for symptom scores following subcutaneous immunotherapy was -0.73 (95% CI -0.97 to -0.50, P &lt; 0.00001), indicating a significant reduction in symptom scores.

<LINK REF="STD-Frew-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frew 2006</LINK> is the largest trial assessing the efficacy and safety of SIT for grass pollen allergy conducted to date. The trial was a three arm study: the first active group (n = 203) received standardised depot preparations of grass pollen extract (Alutard SQ-U, Phleum pratense) at the dosage 100,000 SQ-U, the second active group (n = 104) received the same at the dosage 10,000 SQ-U, and the third group (n = 103) a placebo. Sensitivity analysis was performed by replacing the 100,000 SQ-U data included in the above meta-analysis with the data from the 10,000 SQ-U arm, to test the effect on the result. The revised combined SMD was -0.73 (95% CI -0.97 to -0.49) (P &lt; 0.00001). Significant heterogeneity between studies was still evident (P &lt; 0.0004).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">9. Adverse events </HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were searched for in all studies included in this review. Comparisons were made between subjects treated with subcutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy and subjects treated with placebo control. Adverse events were analysed as local or systemic reactions. Local reactions were analysed in two subgroups according to their need for treatment. Systemic reactions were analysed according to their severity (grading system) and time of onset (before or after 30 minutes) as described above.</P>
<P>The following paragraphs and data provide an overview of the adverse events reported in the included studies. Combining these can be problematic. Ideally a formal meta-analysis would be undertaken. However, most studies reported number of adverse events, rather than the number of participants in which one or more adverse events were observed, making such an analysis difficult. Although it might appear both clinically appropriate and mathematically simple to add up the number of events and divide this by the number of injections or participants (and we do indeed present some of these data) there is a danger that such pooling may undermine the effects of the randomisation process in the individual trials. As a result these data should be considered with some caution.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We have performed a comprehensive systematic review of the effectiveness of subcutaneous injection specific allergen immunotherapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. </P>
<P>This systematic review found 51 randomised controlled trials which satisfied our inclusion criteria. Symptom scores were described as significantly reduced in 31 studies and medication scores were also described as significantly reduced in 24 studies. However, symptom score data from only 15 studies and medication score data from only 13 studies were suitable for meta-analyses. These studies were identified through an extensive search of the published and unpublished literature and this review therefore represents, we believe, a state of the art and up-to-date synthesis of the best evidence available (up to February 2006) on the efficacy and safety of injection specific allergen immunotherapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. </P>
<P>A degree of caution in interpretation of these data is required as there was significant heterogeneity between studies which maybe due to the wide variety of scoring systems used across studies. This is in part compensated for by use of the standardised mean difference in the analyses. Furthermore, it is difficult to know what constitutes a clinically important difference on these scales; the range of symptom scores used potentially also threatens the appropriateness of combining data in a meta-analysis. The variability in the effect of specific injection immunotherapy may be also explained by variable responses to treatment according to the type of allergen used, the quality of allergen vaccines used, the age of participants included in these trials, or the dose and duration of treatment given. Also, in this review, we found a lack of information in some of the studies in describing the optimal maintenance dose of major allergen; this is important to consider because studies suggest that therapeutic efficacy may require high allergen doses. (Low dose immunotherapy is usually ineffective (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), therefore therapeutic efficacy correlates with an optimal maintenance dose in the range of 5 to 20 mcg of major allergen per injection for a number of primary allergens).</P>
<P>The study also shows that the reported clinical benefits may translate into improvements in disease specific quality of life: the most recent studies have reported on outcomes using validated rhinitis quality of life questionnaires. Data relating to individual organ-specific symptom scores from a number of the studies also consistently point to the efficacy of immunotherapy (compared with placebo) in improving nasal, ocular and global symptom scores in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. </P>
<P>In addition, these trials have found strong and consistent evidence that immunotherapy results in favourable responses in a number of immunological outcomes, and although these data are of interest in terms of understanding the pathophysiology of the underlying disease process and the mechanisms of action of injection immunotherapy, their clinical significance remains unclear. The data raise the question whether such biomarkers may be surrogate and/or predictive of the clinical response to immunotherapy and therefore useful for monitoring immunotherapy. Larger controlled trials are required to test this possibility. Data on the cost-effectiveness of injection specific allergen immunotherapy represent an important omission in the reported trials and this data gap needs to be filled by future studies.</P>
<P>In this systematic review, there were no accepted studies of allergen injection immunotherapy that were conducted exclusively in children. Furthermore only nine studies extended the age range to participants younger than 18 years of age; one study included patients between 6 and 56 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Karmaker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Karmaker 1994</LINK>); however, no data assessing specific outcomes were reported in the younger participants. </P>
<P>We have found that patients treated with injection immunotherapy are at increased risk of both local and systemic adverse reactions. In the majority of cases, symptoms were readily reversible with appropriate treatment. This review shows that four events were categorized as 'early systemic reaction grade 4'; three reactions were described in the active treatment group (two cases of anaphylaxis and one case of exacerbation of asthma with oedema of glottis and hypotension) and one case in the placebo group (described as anaphylaxis). No further explanation was given regarding the clinical characteristics of these individuals. It was reported that all subjects fully recovered after adequate treatment and it is relevant that all continued with immunotherapy and none dropped out following these reactions. The number of participants involved in the trials varies from 18 to 410. These numbers compare well with guidelines for Phase I, ll and III clinical trials and provide useful information on the safety of the procedure under carefully controlled circumstances.</P>
<P>Although fatalities associated with the use of immunotherapy have been previously reported in the medical literature (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 2004</LINK>), these occurred almost exclusively in patients with co-existing asthma (16 of 17 in the CSM report). Furthermore, asthma was frequently poorly controlled (i.e. lability, required steroids, and/or prior hospitalisations) and there were additional risk factors. In the AAAAI report (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1993</LINK>), hay fever was reported in 53% (9 of 17) of the patients who died; eight of these patients had coexisting asthma, some also had diabetes and coronary vascular disease. Only one patient was reported to have had hay fever only, but he had coexisting hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and was receiving a B-blocker treatment. Delay or omission in the use of adrenaline in anaphylaxis, wrong selection of candidates for injection immunotherapy, dosing errors, no cardiorespiratory resuscitation facilities available and no adherence to immunotherapy practice guidelines can be responsible for these fatalities. </P>
<P>In the 13 out of 52 studies that reported that adrenaline was available for use, it was only given in seven of these 13 studies. In the seven studies where adrenaline was administered, there were 19 events in the active group and one event in the placebo group that were treated with this medication; this correspond to 0.13% of the 14,085 injections given in the active group and 0.01% of 8278 injections given in the placebo group (Figure 01). These data are likely to overestimate adrenaline usage since it is probable that in the majority of the 39 studies where adrenaline was not mentioned it is unlikely that it was used. </P>
<P>The reasons for adrenaline use varied; these include nasal and ocular itching, facial reddening, pharyngeal itching with cough, moderate wheezing, urticaria, angioedema. In three cases anaphylaxis was reported as the inciting event, although precise details not given. In some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Iliopoulos-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Iliopoulos 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dolz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dolz 1996</LINK>), adrenaline was given as a 'first choice' treatment and adverse events were not described as anaphylaxis. In many instances adrenaline appeared to have been given as a precautionary treatment and should not be regarded as a marker 'per se' of anaphylaxis. In the large multicentre study by <LINK REF="STD-Frew-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Frew 2006</LINK> which included 307 subjects on active immunotherapy, and in whom full documentation of both early and delayed side effects were recorded in patient diary cards, there was no recorded use of adrenaline. </P>
<P>In conclusion, we have found that specific allergen injection immunotherapy is a safe and efficacious treatment in reducing symptom severity and the requirement for anti-allergic medication. Evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy treatment and the tolerable nature of side effects, we can consider that the risk/benefit ratio of injection immunotherapy favours treating patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who have not responded to standard drugs, provided that potential risks and benefits are properly assessed and explained to the patient. In view of the occasional occurrence of systemic side effects following injections and the reported use of adrenaline to treat such reactions, it is important that injection immunotherapy is performed in the immediate presence of a physician and administered by personnel that are fully trained and who are experienced in the early recognition and treatment of such reactions. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Injection immunotherapy for grass pollen is effective in improving symptoms and reducing the need for medication in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and improves disease specific quality of life in these subjects. Whether the treatment is cost-effective remains to be determined. </P>
<P>There are significant risks associated with the use of injection immunotherapy including the rare occurrence of adverse events requiring adrenaline, but when administered in controlled clinical settings this risk is greatly reduced. </P>
<P>In summary, we conclude that injection immunotherapy is a safe and valid treatment option in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is particularly useful in those who fail to respond adequately to other treatments, provided that it is administered in settings in which patients can be monitored and, if necessary, promptly and effectively treated for systemic allergic reactions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for studies to report trial procedures more clearly as detailed in the CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Junker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Junker 1996</LINK>) statements and in particular to describe the randomisation technique employed. Validated outcome measures should be used wherever possible taking care to distinguish between statistical and clinical significance. Given the known risks, all trials should more explicitly record and publish information on adverse events. Finally, there is a pressing need for cost-effectiveness studies for what is a resource intensive intervention. </P>

Pediatric Allergy and Asthma Unit, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. Does specific immunotherapy injection cause an increase in bronchial reactivity? The Journal of Asthma : Official Journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma. 2005. 42 (9): 765-8. BACKGROUND: Several well-controlled studies have proven the clinical benefit of specific immunotherapy (SIT) for seasonal allergic rhinitis (AR). However, whether subcutaneous SIT injection could cause a transient increase in bronchial reactivity (BR) remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether subcutaneous SIT injection, either during or outside the pollen season, could cause an increase in BR in children with pollen allergy. METHODS: Twenty-two children (mean age 13.6 +/- 0.7 years) with AR who were receiving maintenance SIT for 15 months were included in the study. Pre-injection BR of the patients was evaluated with methacholine provocation test immediately before maintenance dose of SIT during the peak pollen season and outside the season. The post-injection test was administered 24 hours after SIT injection. RESULTS: There was no difference in FEV1 measures recorded during (98(93-109)%) and outside (102(96-111)%) the pollen season. There was no significant difference between pre- (64(7-64) mg/mL) and post-allergen injection (32(7.5-64) mg/mL) BR outside the pollen season (p = 0.9). A trend towards improvement following allergen injection (64(5.4-64)) as compared to pre-allergen injection (14.6 (3.5-64)) was shown during the pollen season (p = 0.053). Although PC20 measures in the pollen season were lower than outside the season, the difference was not significant. The percentage of the patients with bronchial hyperreactivity was 62% during and 43% outside the season. CONCLUSION: SIT injections both during and outside the pollen season cause no increase in BR in children with AR. This calls into question the necessity of empirical dose reduction during the pollen season. Journal-Article. Pre-Medline Update Search Feb 2006&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
