<TITLE>Single agent versus combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-17 16:26:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>Metastatic breast cancer is cancer that has advanced and spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes. Although many women will live with advanced disease for many years, treatment is aimed at the alleviation of symptoms rather than cure. The first choice of treatment for advanced disease is dependent on hormone status (whether the tumour is stimulated to grow by oestrogen and progesterone) or whether the tumour overexpresses human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and can be treated with trastuzumab (herceptin). Most women with advanced disease will however receive chemotherapy (anti-cancer agents) either as their first treatment, because their disease has become resistant to some treatments, or in combination with other types of treatments. Chemotherapy drugs can be given alone (single agent) or two or more drugs can be given together (combination chemotherapy). The aim of this review was to compare whether using a more intensive regimen (more than one drug) was better than the single agent treatment for women with advanced disease. We identified 43 eligible trials (48 comparisons- as some trials tested more than one comparison). These trials included 9742 women, 55% of whom were receiving their first treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The review found a benefit for the combination chemotherapy for survival (all trials). This was also the case when trials of first-line treatment only were analysed, and whether the single agent was also included in the combination or not. Combination treatments were also associated with significantly better time to progression (time after treatment until the disease progressed) and response (whether the tumour gets smaller as a result of the treatment). Women receiving combination treatment however experienced more adverse effects of treatment including a decrease in their white cell count, increased hair loss and nausea and vomiting. For women making a decision about treatment, it should be noted that this review was not able to address the issue of whether combination regimens are more effective than sequential treatment with different single agents. Some individual trials raised the possibility that giving a multiagent regimen sequentially with immediate cross-over from one agent to the next on progression may result in survival times similar to that seen when all the agents are given together</P>
<P>An important consideration for women with advanced disease is the balance between the benefit of treatment and the harms or adverse effects that these treatments may have. Unfortunately only 11 trials in this review reported information relating to quality of life. In general, survival gains with combination therapy came at the cost of a significant increase in toxicity and impact on other psychological and social factors which are known to contribute to a sense of quality of life for this group of women. There were insufficient data in this review to comment on the overall impact of the two treatment options on net clinical benefit from the women's perspective. Women with advanced disease will therefore need to seek the information to allow them to make decisions about the potential benefits of additional treatments (small survival gains) in progressing metastatic disease and the impact this can have on their quality of life.</P>

<P>Combination chemotherapy regimens are frequently favoured over single agents for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, in an attempt to achieve superior tumour response rates. It is not known however whether giving more intensive chemotherapy regimens results in better health outcomes, when both survival and toxicity are considered, and whether better response rates and rates of progression free survival actually translate to better overall survival.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:04:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>Forty three eligible trials (48 comparisons) were identified. These included 9742 women, 55% of whom were receiving first-line treatment for metastatic disease. For overall survival there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the combination regimens with no heterogeneity (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, p&lt;0.00001). Results were very similar when trials of first-line treatment were analysed, and for analyses where the single agent was also included in the combination regimen. Combination regimens showed a statistically significant advantage for survival over single agent taxane (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.75-0.89, p&lt;0.00001), but not anthracycline (HR 0.94.86-1.02, p=0.15).</P>
<P>Combination regimens were also associated with significantly better time to progression (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.74 - 0.82, p&lt;0.00001) and response (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 -1.45, p&lt;0.0001) although heterogeneity was statistically significant in both instances and probably due to clinical diversity of the participants and interventions.</P>
<P>Women receiving combination regimens experienced a statistically significant detrimental effect on white cell count, increased alopecia and nausea and vomiting.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-17 13:26:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer-death in that group. In 2000 there were over 1 million new cases and approximately 373,000 deaths from breast cancer world wide; with an age standardised death rate (ASR) of 12.51 (per 100,000). ASRs of 25 or greater were recorded that same year byfor Barbados (25.53), Belgium (26.63), Denmark (29.16), Hungary (25.21), Iceland (36.78), Ireland (25.76), Israel (26.32), Malta (28.39), the Netherlands (27.76), New Zealand (25.94), Switzerland (25.17), Uruguay (26.27) and the UK (26.81) (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>With advances over the last few decades, a greater proportion of women are being diagnosed with breast cancer at an earlier stage when curative approaches are still possible. Regardless, 20-85% of patients depending on stage, tumour biology and treatments used will go on to develop distant metastases (disease which has spread to other parts of the body) <LINK REF="REF-Cardoso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardoso 2002</LINK>. This may be due to subclinical micrometastases despite adequate primary therapy. An additional 6-10% will present with metastatic disease at primary diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Colozza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colozza 2007</LINK>). Metastatic disease is treatable but not curable. Average survival is currently between one to two years, although some women may live with the disease for many years with good quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Colozza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colozza 2007</LINK>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-17 15:29:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>Treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with chemotherapy has undergone several distinct historical phases. Therapy with single agents was first introduced in the 1960's but these agents provided short tumour response. In the 1970's combination regimens such as CMF(cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluoricil) were developed demonstrating further improvements in response (&gt;40%) and time to progression. The incorporation of anthracyclines into newer generation regimens such as AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) came later in the 1980's (<LINK REF="REF-Nabholtz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabholtz 2002</LINK>). Taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel) emerged in the 1990's as a result of a rapid collection of data from high quality prospective randomised controlled trials involving tens of thousands of patients. Taxanes were quickly recognised as evidence based components of therapy for metastatic breast cancer, initially tested as single agents in two settings, patients with, and without prior anthracycline exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Crown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crown 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of predictive factors (patient or tumour characteristics that help to forecast a response to a given treatment), evidence exists in the metastatic setting only for an association between response to endocrine therapy and expression of hormone receptors, and response to trastuzumab related to human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status (<LINK REF="REF-Colozza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colozza 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nabholtz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabholtz 2002</LINK>). Trials that have attempted to identify prognostic factors for patients who may benefit from combination chemotherapy have been conducted but only oestrogen receptor status, disease free interval and number of visceral sites have been identified as having a positive relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Overmoyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overmoyer 2003</LINK>). In endocrine sensitive disease, treatment may safely begin with endocrine therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcken 2003</LINK>) but ultimately most women with metastatic breast cancer will receive chemotherapy either because they have hormone receptor negative disease or because their disease has become refractory to endocrine therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hortobagyi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagyi 1996</LINK>). Currently trastuzumab is recommended at the same time as chemotherapy for patients who have not already received chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer or given alone to patients who have already received chemotherapy for metastatic disease or if chemotherapy is not appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-NBCC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCC 2007</LINK>). Anthracycline combinations are frequently used as first line treatment in hormone-unresponsive MBC and taxanes are extensively used in combination with anthracyclines or when treatment with anthracyclines has failed (<LINK REF="REF-Mart_x00ed_n-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martín 2007</LINK>)<BR/>

<BR/>
Generally speaking, most chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer show a steep dose-response curve in pre-clinical studies. This has led cancer clinicians and researchers to conclude that increasing the intensity of treatment will result in an increase in the rate and duration of response, and hence to improvements in survival (<LINK REF="REF-Hryniuk-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hryniuk 1987</LINK>). Increased dose intensity may also come at the cost of increased toxicity. If palliation is the primary goal of treatment, and anticipated survival is limited, then toxicity and quality of life become important factors when deciding on a treatment regimen. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-02-17 15:33:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>It is commonly thought that combining chemotherapy agents will result in regimens that are more active with improved tumour response and progression rates and hence, better overall survival.</P>
<P>The question of whether to use single agent chemotherapy or combinations when treating women with metastatic breast cancer however remains partially unresolved. Experience over the last thirty years suggests that the use of polychemotherapy produces a higher response rate and increased time to progression (TTP) when compared to a single agent. A systematic review by Fossati (<LINK REF="REF-Fossati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fossati 1998</LINK>) included survival analysis of polychemotherapy agents versus single agents in 2,442 patients. This review found a significantly better complete and partial response rate associated with the combination regimens and a survival advantage (HR 0.82, 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.90).<BR/>

<BR/>
More recently, two<B> </B>large individual trials have also demonstrated survival benefits for combination regimens when compared with very credible single agents, both in the post-anthracycline setting. In the first (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shaughnessy 2002</LINK>), docetaxel plus capecitabine led to better overall survival than docetaxel alone with an improvement of 3 months in median survival and no measurable decline in quality of life. Toxicity was described as manageable, although anecdotal reports suggest this is a relatively toxic regimen and many clinicians do not use it. The second study has been presented but not yet published in the peer-reviewed literature (Albain KS 2004). Women received either paclitaxel alone (3 weekly) or with gemcitabine, and again overall survival was better, with an improvement in median survival of about 3 months. Toxicity is again described as manageable, and this is borne out by anecdotal reports.</P>
<P>In addition, single agent gemcitabine, capecitabine and vinorelbine have been shown to be effective for patients who have progressed during or following anthracycline treatment with response rates of 20-30%, median survival of one year and acceptable safety profiles (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shaughnessy 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shaughnessy 2005</LINK>).<BR/>

<BR/>

</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-12-11 14:21:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>Opinion is currently divided as to whether improvements in response and time to progression (TTP) necessarily correlate with an improvement in survival in this setting, or, whether combination chemotherapy is superior to the sequential use of single agent anthracyclines and taxanes (<LINK REF="REF-Cardoso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardoso 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nabholtz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabholtz 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shaughnessy 2005</LINK>).It is also not known which patients will benefit from which regimens. Combination regimens such as anthracycline/ taxane combinations are considered appropriate by some clinicians for patients with rapidly progressing visceral disease (i.e. hepatic metastases, pulmonary lymphangitic spread) followed by sequential single agent treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Overmoyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overmoyer 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Seidman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seidman 2003</LINK>) and others find this approach more appropriate in an adjuvant setting (Seidman 2003).</P>

<P>Included were women with advanced (metastatic) breast cancer, either newly diagnosed or recurrent. Trials including both women with metastatic disease and women with locoregionally recurrent disease were eligible for inclusion if data were provided separately for each group, or if women with isolated locoregional recurrence comprised less than 20% of the total group. There were no age restrictions.</P>
<P>In the protocol for this review it was proposed that trials containing women receiving first line chemotherapy (no previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease) only be included in this review. This was later changed to include subsequent lines of treatment. Hence, results are presented by treatment line (i.e. 100% first-line and all lines combined). Trials with participants with locoregional disease were not included in the analysis of 100% firstline therapy for metastatic disease.</P>

<P>Trials where endocrine therapy was given to both treatment groups were also included as were trials that may, or may not, have specified recommended treatment upon disease progression or initial treatment failure. High dose chemotherapy regimens were excluded.</P>
<P>Patients with advanced disease who progress on the treatment they are randomised to receive, will often have treatment changed at the time of progression. In some instances this may involve crossing over to the other arm of the trial and in other cases may involve receiving other treatment off-study. Trials where patients crossed over to the other treatment arm at the time of progression are, therefore, included in this review and analysed according to the treatment they were first randomised to receive. Sequential trials where patients were allocated to receive a set number of cycles of one treatment and then crossed over to the other treatment arm (not at the time of progression but upon completion of the first treatment) are included only where data are reported for the first treatment.</P>

<P>1. Overall survival (OS) - time from date randomised to date of death (any cause).<BR/>2. Time to progression (TTP)- time from date randomised to date of progression or death (any cause). This is also referred to as Progression-free survival (PFS).<BR/>3. Response - the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response (Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of all measurable disease for some minimum time period. Partial response is defined as shrinkage of tumour such that shrinkage post-treatment is &lt;50% of shrinkage pre-treatment for some minimum time period in the absence of growth of any lesion or the appearance of new lesions).<BR/>4. Quality-of-life measures (trial specific instruments)<BR/>5. Toxicity (Grade 3 or more: WHO criteria) - Toxicities of interest were nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and reduction in the level of white cell count (WCC&lt;2000) (Leukopenia, neutropenia)</P>
<P>Time to treatment failure (TTF) was a planned outcome for this review. It was defined as time from date randomised to date of progression, death (any cause), withdrawal due to adverse event, patient refusal or further anti-cancer therapy for documented progression. Five trials (seven comparisons) reported TTF (<LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falkson-G-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Falkson G 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-Epi-_x0028_A_x0029_-1991" TYPE="STUDY">French Epi (A) 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-French-Epi-_x0028_B_x0029_-1991" TYPE="STUDY">French Epi (B) 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nabholtz-JM-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nabholtz JM 1999</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Sledge-G_x0028_A_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge G(A) 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-G_x0028_B_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge G(B) 2003</LINK>) however not all trials used definitions in alignment with our pre-specified definition. This outcome was therefore not included in this review. However one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sledge-G_x0028_A_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge G(A) 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-G_x0028_B_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge G(B) 2003</LINK>) labelled a curve as TTF but reported the outcome as TTP. In the absence of a clear definition by the trial report, and taking into account their reporting of the data as TTP, this trial was included in the analysis for TTP.</P>
<P>This review also attempted to investigate treatment-related death, which for the purpose of this review is defined as death due to the toxicity of the drug and not to disease progression. If an individual trial did not include the definition used by that trial but used the terms "toxic death" or "lethal toxicity", or indicated that death was due to treatment, then the information was included in the review.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:12:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and time-to-progression (TTP)/progression-free survival (PFS) for which the hazard ratio (HR) is the most appropriate statistic. When possible, the HR and associated variances were extracted directly from the trial publication(s). If not reported the HR was obtained indirectly using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> by using either other available summary statistics or by extracting data from published Kaplan-Meier curves. The hazard ratio (HR) and associated statistics were calculated, where necessary, using an Excel spreadsheet developed by the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>). To allow for immature follow up the numbers at risk were adjusted based on estimated minimum and maximum follow-up times. If these were not reported in any of the reports available, minimum follow up was estimated using the estimated time taken to complete a cycle of treatment, and maximum follow-up was estimated based on the last reported event on the curve. These follow-up estimates are recorded in the Characteristics of included studies table under Notes.</P>
<P>A pooled HR was obtained from the derived observed (O) minus expected (E) number of events and the variance for each trial, using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). The pooled HR represents the overall risk of an event on a combination regimen versus a regimen where only one chemotherapy agent was used. HRs less than 1.0 favour combination regimens and values greater than 1.0 favour the control group (single drug chemotherapy). </P>
<P>Response rates were analysed as dichotomous variables (complete and/or partial versus stable disease or no response) and a pooled relative risk was derived. Response has been reported based on assessable (not randomised) patients as most of the trials reported the data for this group. Random effects model was used for pooling as there was significant heterogeneity. Toxicity was analysed by extracting the total number of grade III and/or IV events and the number at risk for each trial. These were summed and used to calculate a single relative risk (with 95% confidence intervals). The specific toxicities of interest for this review were effect of chemotherapy on WCC (leukopenia and neutropenia), nausea or vomiting and alopecia.</P>
<P>Quality-of-life data were collated from those trials reporting it. Trials used a variety of instruments (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). As a result, data were not statistically synthesised but summarised and evaluated qualitatively.<BR/>
<BR/>This review also attempted to investigate treatment-related deaths which, for the purpose of this review, were defined as deaths due to the toxicity of the drug and not related to disease progression. If an individual trial did not define treatment related death but used the terms "toxic death" or "lethal toxicity" then the information was included in the review.</P>
<P>Where multi-arm trials were included in the meta-analysis and one treatment arm was included in more than one treatment comparison, the number of events and the number of women in that arm were divided by the number of treatment comparisons. This method was used to avoid the multiple use of women in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial.</P>

<P>For the first review conducted in 2004, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group contained 5,472 references of which 857 were coded as references to studies of chemotherapy and advanced breast cancer. For this search 198 were identified as potentially relevant to the review but 148 were excluded. Fifty complete papers were obtained leading to the exclusion of a further 13 references. This left a total of 37 references to trials for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Because some of the trials incorporated two comparators, 42 separate comparisons were included in the original review.</P>
<P>For this update, a further 15 references to trials were screened. This resulted in the inclusion of 6 new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Albain--KS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Albain KS 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-2007" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Norris-B-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Norris B 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-J-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Shaughnessy J 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockler-M-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stockler M 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-E-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas E 2008</LINK>) and 2 trials which had previously been classified as 'ongoing' (<LINK REF="STD-Ejlertsen--B-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ejlertsen B 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidemann-E-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heidemann E 2004</LINK>).

</I>For question 1, 21 comparisons includeding data on WCC (5164 assessable patients), 11 reported on alopecia (2778 assessable patients) and 20 reported on nausea and vomiting (5149 assessable patients). Based on these trials combination chemotherapy was associated with a statistically significant detrimental effect on WCC (RR 1.69, CI 1.30 to 2.20, p=0.0001) and increased alopecia (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.30, p=0.031).

<BR/>For question 2, 14 comparisons reported on WCC (2646 assessable patients), 10 comparisons reported on alopecia (2040 assessable patients), and 10 comparisons (2338 assessable patients) reported on nausea and vomiting. There was no statistically significant difference for WCC (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.74, p=0.13). Combination chemotherapy was associated with significantly more nausea and vomiting toxicity (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.43, p=0.08).

<P>A variety of QoL instruments were used including: LASA, Spitzer, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), WHO Analogue and Satisfaction Scales Questionnaire, Brunners Score, Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL), FACT-B and the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Score. The QoL indicators for patients typically assessed were mood, pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, hair loss, loss of appetite and social functioning. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop--J-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop J 1999</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 2001</LINK>) also rated clinician assessment of the patients QoL using the Spitzer quality-of-life index.</P>
<P>Five trials reported some statistically significant differences between the treatment arms. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Albain--KS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Albain KS 2004</LINK>) reported a statistically significant advantage in global QoL. Participants in this trial recorded a significantly and consistently better global QoL for the single drug arm (paclitaxel). In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heidemann--E-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heidemann E 2002</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Joensuu-H-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Joensuu H 1998</LINK>), better QoL was associated with single-agent chemotherapy. Heidemann 2002 reported that patients receiving mitoxantrone reported less hair loss, nausea and vomiting. Patients in the Joensuu 1998 trial treated with epirubicin showed no difference in psychological dimensions of QoL but reported less physical distress and nausea at 6 months and at other assessable points during the trial. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nabholtz-JM-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nabholtz JM 1999</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 2001</LINK>) reported results favouring both single and combination regimens. Nabholtz JM (1999) found a significant difference in QoL for patients in the docetaxel arm in terms of nausea and vomiting and loss of appetite but for patients in the mitomycin plus vinblastine arm for role and social functioning. The authors also concluded that as patients with the poorest health did not complete the QoL questionnaires, QoL might be overestimated in both groups. In ANBCTG (2001) patients in the combination arm (CMFP) reported better QoL for the first three months for pain, mood, and nausea and vomiting but worse QoL for hair loss. Results were similar overall. Although <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-J-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Shaughnessy J 2002</LINK> found no statistically significant differences, there was a trend towards less deterioration in the global score for the combination arm (docetaxel and capecetibine).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:12:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>It is generally thought that combining chemotherapy agents will result in regimens with superior tumour response and progression and improved overall survival.</P>
<P>The overall survival data analysed for this review, based on 7147 randomised women (5168 deaths), showed a statistically significant benefit for the use of combination chemotherapy regimens compared with single agent regimens (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.93, p&lt;0.00001). Results were very similar for overall survival for women receiving first-line chemotherapy and for the analysis of first-line treatment where the single agent was also included in the combination regimen. Where the single agent was not included in the combination regimen for first-line treatment there was no significant difference between the groups. However one trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Stockler-M-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stockler M 2006</LINK>), showed a survival benefit in favour of the single agent (capecitabine). It is possible that this was due to better tolerability (evident from QoL and toxicity data) than with CMF. Three times as many participants were still taking the single agent after twelve months in this trial.</P>
<P>Combination regimens also prevailed in the analysis of a single agent taxane versus any combination (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89, p&lt;0.00001), with no difference being shown between the groups for the analysis of single agent anthracycline. The failure to show a difference in this case may be due to prior exposure to anthracyclines either in the metastatic or adjuvant setting. For both of these comparisons there was no statistically significant heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Combination regimens were also associated with better time to progression and significantly improved response rates. The addition of chemotherapy agents to the same single-agent cytotoxic generally created a more intense regimen and resulted in a greater anti-tumour response, and toxicity related to alopecia and reduced white cell count.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses by class did not find any advantage for single agents. When added to a regimen, taxane appeared to confer an advantage compared to its use as a single agent. The addition of anthracycline to a regimen appeared to offer a statistically significant benefit for time to progression and response over anthracycline given alone although there was no difference between them for overall survival. The sub-group analyses should however be interpreted with some caution given the smaller number of patients available in each subgroup, and the potential for confounding. For example, this review has not been able to take into consideration that some women will have been pre-treated (increasingly in an adjuvant setting or for metastatic disease) with a taxane or anthracycline. In addition some regimens in this review used agents which are no longer considered standard treatment and which could be regarded as suboptimal chemotherapy - regimens containing mitomycin, vinblastine, and fluorouracil for example.</P>
<P>Increased toxicity, namely nausea and vomiting, alopecia and reduction in white cell count was consistently associated with combination regimens. This is not unexpected given the range of combinations and levels of activity. This review included trials published from the late 1970s to the present and as such reflect a wide variation in the management of side effects including dose reduction, anti-emetics and growth factor support. Rates of toxic or treatment related death were similar in both groups (57 deaths in the single agent arms and 53 in the combination regimen arms).</P>
<P>Considerable heterogeneity was evident across the various time to progression and response analyses. This is likely to reflect clinical diversity of the participants (menopausal status, hormone receptor status, disease stage and HER2 status) and interventions (the varying efficacy of the comparator regimens, the different agents, dosages and schedules) leading to an intervention effect which was different in different trials. An attempt was made to account for the clinical heterogeneity by grouping the trials according to sub-groups reflecting common treatment practices however many subgroups were then too small for meaningful analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>The findings in relation to quality of life offer mixed results and our observations are based on the subjective interpretation of only eleven individual trial reports. In general, survival gains with combination therapy came at the cost of a significant increase in toxicity and impact on other factors such as psychosocial morbidity, which contribute to the quality of life for this group of women. There were insufficient data in this review to comment on the overall impact of the regimens on net clinical benefit from the women's perspective. Clinical trials research increasingly includes routine assessment of quality of life indicators. These trials also need to take into account the information needs of women which support their decision-making about the potential benefits of additional treatments (small survival gains) in progressing metastatic disease and the impact this has on their quality of life.</P>
<P>Although this review shows a benefit for the major outcomes in favour of the combination regimen chemotherapy, there are many factors which are unaccounted for in this review, including hormone receptor status and HER2 status of the participants. This review was also not able to address the issue of whether combination regimens are more effective than single agents given sequentially. Some individual trials raised the possibility that giving a multiagent regimen sequentially with immediate cross-over from one agent to the next on progression may result in survival times similar to that seen when all the agents are given together (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-G_x0028_A_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge G(A) 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-G_x0028_B_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge G(B) 2003</LINK>). This is a question which equally should be addressed. </P>
<P>In addition this review has not addressed the increasing use of targeted biologics such as trastuzumab and bevacizumab, and the effect that treatment with these agents may have on the way chemotherapy is administered.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-17 16:24:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-17 16:24:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>Combination-chemotherapy regimens appear to offer a benefit in overall survival, time to progression and response over traditional single chemotherapy agents that include cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, epirubicin, lomustine and ifosamide. The findings are consistent with the review of <LINK REF="REF-Fossati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fossati 1998</LINK> although they are not necessarily applicable to some of the more modern single agents including, docetaxel, paclitaxel and capecitabine for example. </P>
<P>The main limitation in this review is that very few studies actually reported the rate of cross-over to the additional agent upon progression on mono-therapy. A further systematic review is underway which will compare combination chemotherapy to the same drugs given sequentially.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Additional research is needed to further explore the relationships between response, toxicity, time to progression, survival and quality of life for single and combination regimens particularly in relation to modern cyctotoxic agents and targeted therapies. All trials of chemotherapy regimens must include rigorous quality of life measures to be integrated with all treatment research in order to extract the most meaningful data for patient decision making and care.</P>

<P>This review was updated in August 2008. A new search was conducted March 2008 and the review has undergone significant and accumulated change. A summary of changes is included below:<BR/>
<BR/>New trials added:<BR/>Albain 2004; Ejlertsen 2004; GEICAM 2007; Heidemann 2004; Norris 2000; O'Shaughnessy 2001; Stockler 2006;Thomas 2007<BR/>
<BR/>Additional data added for previously included trials:<BR/>Heidemann 2002 - Overall survival and TTP curve data re-done<BR/>Updated survival information for O'Shaunnessy 2002 (Norris paper) minimum 27mths follow up<BR/>Updated data for Icli 2002 - Now Icli 2005<BR/>
<BR/>Trials removed from the 2005 systematic review:<BR/>Keller 2004- Was included in initial review based on data obtained from ASCO 2001 conference proceeding (Abstact number 115). This trial was subsequently removed from the updated review following retrieval of the full published paper (2004) which further clarified the regimens studied. Of the 151 participants in the control arm 129 were receiving single agent vinorelbine and 22 received mitomycin C plus vinblastine. Data was not provided separately for combination and single agent regimens within the control group.<BR/>Liu 1986 - Was included in the initial review but excluded at update. This exclusion was based on a post hoc consideration to not include high dose chemotherapy regimens. Clinical discussion confirmed that this review should reflect standard/conventional chemotherapy regimens<BR/>
<BR/>Trials previously in ongoing - now excluded from the review (See Characteristics of excluded studies table):<BR/>Anonymous 2002; Doroshow 2000; Jackish 1999; Perez 2001<BR/>
<BR/>New ongoing trial:<BR/>Butler 2004</P>
<P>All data was checked for this update and all sections of the text revised. The background and discussion was re-written. Risk of bias tables were done retrospectively for all 43 trials (48 comparisons)</P>

<TD>
<P>Albain 2004</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) prior to each cycle</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>291 patients completed BPI and 350 completed RSCL. The mean RSCL global QOL score for patients receiving the combined regimen was significantly and consistently better than that reported by the patients in the single drug arm; this was also clinically significant. Mean changes and trends in pain intensity and interference were similar across treatment arms</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>ANZBCTG 2001</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed 14 linear analogue assessment scales; the clinician used the Spitzer QL-index, at least each 3 months.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patient rated quality of life was significantly better for CMFP than Mitoxantrone over the first 3 months, in terms of pain, mood and nausea and vomiting, though worse in terms of hair loss and similar overall.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bishop 1999 (ANZ TITG)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed linear analog scales (LASA) sand physician completed Spitzer QOL index</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>QOL measures (physical well-being, mood, nausea and vomiting, appetite, overall quality of life and physician-rated quality of life) were slightly better in the taxane arm. The exception was pain which was slightly better in the non-taxane arm. Differences were not statistically significant.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Fraser 1993</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed 3 quality of life instruments: 4 weekly Nottingham Health Profile (NHP - emotional state, energy, pain, physical mobility, sleep and social factors ) and Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) at the start of treatment and four weekly thereafter and the Qualitator daily diary card throughout treatment which measured the domains of physical symptoms, social factors, emotional factors and physical performance.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Of the 40 patients randomised, compliance for the 29 who started the Qualitator, the 37 who started the NHP and 36 who started theLASA respectively were 88%, 89% and 92%. Quality of life measures only recorded a significant difference in energy and pain, influenced primarily by the non responders in each treatment group but with no difference in overall global scores. Scores for responders (58% for CMF, 29% for epirubicin, P&gt;0.05), irrespective of treatment were better to start with (LASA P=0.001); at 12 weeks, scores had improved (Qualitator P&lt;0.05; NHP P&lt;0.05). Scores in non responders showed no change.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Heideman 2002</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed the Graduated WHO Analogue and Satisfaction Scales questionnaire at baseline, and day 1 of each cycle. A modified Brunners score (MBS) was applied to assess gain from treatment.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>87% (201/238) of randomised patients, treated until progression returned QOL questionnaires. 100% complete data was available to calculate the MBS for 46% patients (110/238). 38% patients (91/238) had single missing values but where evaluable. A significant gain from treatment was reported for the mitoxantrone arm (P=&lt;0.001) explained as a result of significantly less hair loss and nausea/vomiting.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Joensuu 1998</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) which includes 30 QOL items grouped in two subscales that correspond to psychological and physical distress and eight items that describe physical activities</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Data on QOL were available for 94% of randomised patients (285/303). No difference between the two arms was found in the psychological dimension of QOL analysis. Patients treated with epirubicin (single agent) showed less physical distress at 6 months after commencing treatment (P=0.002) with scores tending to be lower also for that group at other times chosen for analysis. Similarly patients treated with epirubicin reported less nausea (P &lt;0.01). They also reported less stomach pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and itching although this was not statistically significant. Patients in the combination group were more likely to report the therapy to be difficult at 6 and 9 months from randomisation than those in the single group (P= 0.04 and 0.02 respectively)</P>

<P>Nabholtz 1999 (304 Study Group)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed EORTC QLQ-C30</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>72% of questionnaires returned for docetaxel and 68% for MV for baseline and cycle 2, but deteriorated to 59% for docetaxel and 61% for MV by cycle 8. Attrition more evident in MV and did not occur at random. Significantly higher proportion of patients in MV discontinued treatment due to deterioration in condition: authors conclude that patients in the poorest health did not complete QOL questionnaires, hence QOL may be overestimated in both groups. Groups similar at baseline for global health, physical functioning and symptoms except for role functioning and diarrhoea (imbalance in favour of docetaxel). Results: No signficant difference in global health status. Significant difference in favour of docetaxel for nausea/vomiting and loss of appetite, and in favour of MV for role and social functioning.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>In total 230 patients (3 cycles of treatment) filled out 2-4 questionnaires and 191 patients (6 cycles of treatment) filled out 2-5 questionnaires. There was no significant difference between the arms or the profiles of the mean global QOL scores or any of the 8 additional domains (cognitive, emotional, physical, role, social, fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain) over the first 6 cycles. QOL scores showed a significant improvement over time in the global, emotional, social, pain, and nausea/vomiting domains for patients receiving 6 cycles.</P>
