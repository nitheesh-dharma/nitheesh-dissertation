<P>Too little evidence to show whether the unborn baby's growth improves when pregnant women take calcium channel blockers, and more research is needed.</P>
<P>Calcium channel blocker drugs relax muscles and lower blood pressure by reducing the intake of calcium into some cells. It has been thought that these drugs may improve the growth of an unborn baby who is growing more slowly than expected in the womb (impaired fetal growth). The review of trials has found too little evidence from trials on the effects of pregnant women taking calcium channel blockers. Only one trial, involving 100 women, has been included. However, there is some evidence of improved growth in some babies, and more research is needed into the effects of these drugs on both smoking and non-smoking women and their babies.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-03 16:36:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Impaired fetal growth is the failure of a newborn to achieve its genetically determined growth potential, which may cause death as well as short or long-term childhood morbidity. It has been reported that 3% to 10% of neonates are small for corresponding gestational age and an estimated 30% of this is due to impaired fetal growth. Remaining 70% is due to constitutional factors such as maternal ethnicity, parity, weight and height (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>). The condition occurs with limited flow of nutrients and/or oxygen from mother to fetus as a result of fetal causes (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformations), placental factors (e.g. small placenta), or maternal factors (e.g. malnutrition, vascular/renal disease, drugs or other metabolic conditions) (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus by measuring the abdominal circumference, head circumference, length of upper leg and interpreting these using standardised formulae allows the clinician to estimate the fetal weight, to relate this to the gestational age and to follow the growth progress. Ultrasound evaluation also allows to some extent to estimate the timing and the cause of the impairment. Symmetrical growth of the fetus is generally due to early problems such as chromosomal abnormalities, drugs, chemical agents or infection. Asymmetric growth usually results from inadequacy of substrates the fetus needs particularly later in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). In low-income settings where early pregnancy ultrasound is not available fetal growth can be monitored by serial symphysis fundus measurements. However, there is no proven effective treatment that can be applied once growth impairment is diagnosed. In general, when no apparent congenital abnormality exists, management is conservative by frequent growth measurements, smoking cessation if the mother smokes and early delivery when the fetus is thought be mature enough to survive outside the womb. </P>
<P>The outcomes of impaired growth are variable and usually related to the specific cause. For example, if the growth impairment is due to chromosomal anomalies or congenital abnormalities, the fetus is more at risk of a perinatal death. Other short-term outcomes may be moderate to mild metabolic problems (hypoglycemia, polycythemia, meconium aspiration, etc.) due to the chronic oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Depending on the severity and the duration of the condition, long-term outcomes may differ from normal to small decreases in IQ to an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Calcium channel blockers have effects on vascular contractility as well as intracellular energy generation by blocking calcium entry into the cell. Various calcium channel blockers with differential effects are available. Nimodipine has been shown to reduce resistance to blood flow in the cerebral arteries in a series of 10 women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Belfort-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belfort 1994</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers have also been researched as tocolytic agents in addition to their main use which is lowering of blood pressure. Therefore, there is a theoretical possibility of increasing blood flow to the fetus or improving feto-placental cellular energy generation which could result in improved outcomes for fetuses with growth impairment.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the study of Janssens (<LINK REF="STD-Janssens-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Janssens 1985</LINK>), participants were 'randomly assigned' to flunarizine or matching placebo. There was an unexplained imbalance in the infant sex ratio (18 males: five females in the study group versus 11 males: 13 females among the controls) in the interim analysis. This discrepancy did not persist in the final analysis (27 males: 23 females versus 26 males: 24 females).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Among 50 women who received 10 mg flunarizine daily, the mean duration of pregnancy was 282 days, versus 279 days in the placebo group (n = 50, P = 0.2). The mean birthweight was greater in the study group (3291 g versus 3011 g in the placebo group, P = 0.0024). The lower incidence of preterm births may reflect the play of chance, as may the difference in perinatal mortality.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Calcium channel blockers have diverse effects. They may improve intracellular energy generation and decrease smooth muscle contractility. The trial reviewed is sufficiently encouraging to justify further research in this area. However, only smoking women with impaired fetal growth were included in this trial and it would be worthwhile exploring whether this effect is seen only in this group of women.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is inadequate evidence from this trial to support the routine use of calcium channel blockers in pregnancies in which the risk of impaired fetal growth is increased.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The results of this small trial are sufficiently encouraging to justify further trials with sufficient numbers and inclusion of both smoking and nonsmoking women with impaired fetal growth to assess effects on substantive outcomes.</P>
