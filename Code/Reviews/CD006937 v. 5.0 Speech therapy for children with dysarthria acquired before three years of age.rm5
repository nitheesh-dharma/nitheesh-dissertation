<P>

<B>The review question</B>

</P>
<P>
This review aimed to investigate if therapy is generally effective for children with dysarthria acquired early in life, and if certain types of therapy may be better than others. 
</P>
<P>

<B>Background</B>

</P>
<P>Dysarthria is a speech disorder linked to difficulties controlling the muscles needed for speaking. Children with dysarthria often have shallow, irregular breathing which creates difficulties in generating sufficient breath to support speech. They have low pitched, breathy or harsh voices, nasalised speech and very poor pronunciation. Together, these difficulties make the children's speech difficult to understand. Dysarthria is caused by neurological impairment and can arise early in children's lives, from neurological damage sustained before, during or after birth, such as in cerebral palsy, or in early childhood through traumatic brain injury or neurological disease. Communication difficulties have a profound impact on children&#8217;s development. They reduce the quality of life of children with cerebral palsy and place children at risk of social exclusion, educational failure and later unemployment. Speech and language therapy aims to help children to control the movements for breathing and speech and so become more intelligible. </P>
<P>

<B>Study characteristics</B>

</P>
<P>
We found no randomised controlled trials or controlled group studies which investigate the effects of speech and language therapy to improve the speech of children with dysarthria acquired below three years of age.
</P>
<P>

<B>Key results</B>

</P>
<P>Small, observational studies have suggested that, for some children, therapy might have been associated with positive changes in intelligibility and clarity of voice. 
 Rigorous research, using randomised controlled trials, is needed to evaluate if therapy can help children to increase the intelligibility of their speech and if enhanced intelligibility increases children's participation in social and educational activities and their quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-30 07:45:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with motor impairments often have the motor speech disorder dysarthria, a condition which effects the tone, strength and co-ordination of any or all of the muscles used for speech. Resulting speech difficulties can range from mild, with slightly slurred articulation and breathy voice, to profound, with an inability to produce any recognisable words. Children with dysarthria are often prescribed communication aids to supplement their natural forms of communication. However, there is variation in practice regarding the provision of therapy focusing on voice and speech production. Descriptive studies have suggested that therapy may improve speech, but its effectiveness has not been evaluated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-30 17:40:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysarthria is the term used to describe speech disorders that are caused by neuromuscular impairments. People with dysarthria have difficulties controlling and co-ordinating the speed, range, strength and duration of movements needed for speech and as a result their speech may be difficult to understand. For example, difficulties with lip and tongue movements may cause 'tip' to be heard as 'sip', 'hip' or 'sieve'; 'beach' to be heard as 'eats'; 'decide' as 'sigh' or 'say.' Difficulties affecting the larynx alter the quality of phonation (sound made when air passes through vibrating vocal folds) and the pitch and loudness of speech. Speech may lack variation in loudness, pitch and rhythm or there may be inappropriate swings in pitch and loudness. Difficulties with speech loudness, pitch and rhythm may also be associated with poor respiratory control. Speakers may have shallow breathing and have difficulty co-ordinating exhalation with phonation, giving them only a small amount of air on which to speak. Involvement of the soft palate typically leads to perceptions of excess nasality in a person's speech. Symptoms of dysarthria can range from mild slurring of speech sounds and slightly low pitch to complete inability to produce any intelligible words.</P>
<P>Dysarthria in childhood is associated with congenital disorders such as cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Lepage-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepage 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bax-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bax 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odding-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odding 2006</LINK>) and with acquired aetiologies such as brain tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Mourik-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Mourik 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cornwell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornwell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>) and traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Netsell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Netsell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2002</LINK>). Approximately 20% of children with cerebral palsy have speech which is affected by dysarthria (<LINK REF="REF-Nordberg-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordberg 2013</LINK>). We do not know 

how many additional children have dysarthria arising from other causes
, however, cerebral palsy and head injury remain two of the most common medical causes of referral to speech and language therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Petheram-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petheram 2001</LINK>). As the speech impairments of dysarthria are neurologically based they do not resolve. Intervention seeks to maximise children's speech performance, teaching them how to use different movements and lay down new motor programmes for those movements. The learning of new motor behaviours requires intensive practice (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2005</LINK>) involving considerable therapy input over long time periods. Dysarthria therapy, therefore, potentially carries considerable costs to health services even though the prevalence of the disorder in childhood may be small.</P>
<P>Speech and language therapy to reduce the motor speech impairments experienced by children, and the intelligibility limitations these impairments impose, has been advocated in textbooks on dysarthria (<LINK REF="REF-Love-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Love 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strand-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strand 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodge-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodge 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1999</LINK>). An approach that targets all subsystems of the vocal tract,
 breathing, nasal resonance, articulation and pitch control is commonly described, and is similar to interventions for adults with dysarthria acquired following neurological insults (e.g. a stroke). Treatment focusing on one or more subsystem in speech production may, for example, aim to help children control their breathing and maintain adequate pressure for speech across a phrase. This might involve teaching children how to start to speak at the beginning of exhalation and how to split utterances into smaller phases in which they can maintain adequate volume. Intervention also involves slowing children's speech rate, to allow more precise movement of muscles in the oral tract. 
<LINK REF="REF-Strand-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strand 1995</LINK>
 and 
<LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1999</LINK>
 also advocate increasing respiratory effort and making jaw movements bigger in speech to increase oral cavity volume, plus the use of speech and non-speech exercises to help close the airway to the nose during speech. Treatment for articulation has only been advised when other aspects of speech production have been or are being addressed, as "imprecise production of speech sounds (which is the most common perceptual characteristic of dysarthria) is not simply an oral articulatory problem, and is usually the result of laryngeal, velopharyngeal, respiratory and oral articulatory problems" (<LINK REF="REF-Strand-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strand 1995</LINK>, p134). Thus, more precise articulation and improved intelligibility is thought to be achieved through developing control of breathing for speech, increasing background effort and slowing speech rate (<LINK REF="REF-Love-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Love 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strand-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strand 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1996</LINK>
; 
<LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1999</LINK>

). Treatment for prosody (intonational contours of speech) and pitch control has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Strand-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strand 1995</LINK>
; 
<LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1999</LINK>
). This comprises exercises to control the rate of words spoken and pauses used, increase volume and possibly the use of pitch change. As treatment of isolated oromotor movements has not been found to affect speech (<LINK REF="REF-Weismer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weismer 2006</LINK>), all therapy is functional, being directed at speech production.</P>
<P>Although therapy for dysarthria in childhood has been described in speech and language therapy textbooks, its effects are currently unclear. An earlier version of this review (New Reference) showed that there were a small number of phase I and II studies of therapy for children with early acquired dysarthria but no controlled group studies. Speech and language therapists, therefore, have little evidence on which to base treatment decisions. Some may provide dysarthria intervention as there is no evidence to suggest that the treatment does not work or causes harm. Others may withhold treatment because there is no evidence showing its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Speech allows us to share complex thoughts and ideas quickly, and is the most highly prized form of human communication. Communication difficulties are associated with lower quality of life and limited participation for children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fauconnier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauconnier 2009</LINK>) and children with speech and communication disorders are at risk of educational failure, social exclusion and later unemployment (<LINK REF="REF-ICAN-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICAN 2007</LINK>). Such problems not only have an obvious individual and family impact but also present considerable societal and economic consequences. To ensure that children have a clear means of communication, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, such as symbol books and speech synthesis
ers, are often provided. However, many children still choose to communicate by speech. It is important to investigate if the intelligibility of the speech of children with dysarthria can be improved, as being more immediately understandable will maximise the chances of communication success and may facilitate interaction in all areas of life. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the studies of speech therapy for children who have acquired dysarthria early in life and to investigate the relative effectiveness of different types of treatment. We focused on children who acquire dysarthria below three years of age as they may differ from children with later-
acquired pathologies in terms of their neural development, plasticity and recovery patterns; memories of fluent speech; retrieval of previously developed motor programmes; self image (seeing themselves as a fluent speaker rather than a person with a speech disorder); and patterns of communication development. Children with early acquired dysarthria may never have developed motor programmes for fluent speech or have memories of non-dysarthric speech and may not see themselves as an intelligible speaker. Furthermore, children with severe speech and motor impairments arising from congenital pathologies or those acquired in early infancy have highly unusual patterns of communication development. They take a mainly responsive role in communication and often fail to develop a full range of conversational skills (<LINK REF="REF-Pennington-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 1999</LINK>). Interventions for children who acquire dysarthria at three years of age and above are the subjects of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although not the focus of the review, we have summarised the findings of the excluded observational studies of speech and language therapy intervention aimed at improving the speech of children with dysarthria identified by our searches in order show developing evidence for dysarthria intervention for this clinical group. Studies are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and we present a summary of their findings here.

Those that included motor learning principles of intensive practice, knowledge of results and fading feedback; multiple data collection points pre and post therapy; and blinded outcome assessment provide support for the potential effectiveness of this type of intervention, with increases in speech intelligibility and improvements in acoustic measures associated with voice quality being observed (<LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2013</LINK>). Motor learning principles were also used with proprioceptive feedback in the hierarchical treatment PROMPT (Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets (<LINK REF="REF-Hayden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 1994</LINK>)), which was associated with increased oromotor movement and phonetic accuracy and possibly improved intelligibility (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2013</LINK>

Electropalatography increased articulatory precision (<LINK REF="STD-Nordberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nordberg 2011</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-06-06 21:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with early acquired dysarthria often have reduced quality of life and are at risk of social exclusion, failure in education and later unemployment. In addition, there can be psychosocial, family and societal economic consequences. Children with severe dysarthria are often prescribed augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems 
(such as pictures, symbol or word charts or voice output communication aids)  to supplement their natural modes of communication but children still prefer to communicate by speech wherever possible.</P>
<P>In this review we aimed to examine the effectiveness of interventions to improve the speech of children with dysarthria acquired below three years of age. We searched for randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs but found no studies of these types. Searches did identify a number of observational studies, however, which have suggested that interventions which follow motor learning principles may be associated with increases in speech intelligibility, precision of articulatory movements and voice quality and clarity for children with moderate and severe dysarthria. Further interventions may have been reported in non-controlled studies, but may not have been identified in this review.</P>

<P>Observational studies identified during this review suggest that several interventions which follow motor learning principles may be associated with increases in speech intelligibility, voice quality and clarity. Rigorous research, in the form of randomised controlled trials, is needed to test the general effectiveness of speech and language therapy for children with early acquired dysarthria. Trials should include no therapy and attentional placebo control arms. They should evaluate changes in speech impairment and function, by measuring change in speech intelligibility, voice quality and clarity. And, as intelligible communication allows children to engage with the world around them, trials should also investigate the impact of intervention on children&#8217;s social participation. This should include the extent and success of children&#8217;s communication with friends, family, teachers and strangers and their engagement in social and educational activities. The consequent impact of communication change on well-being should also be evaluated using quality of life measures. Such primary and secondary effects may evolve over different periods of time. It is important, therefore, that development and potential decay of effects is evaluated in the short (e.g. one month), medium (e.g. three months) and long (e.g. six to twelve months) term. The costs of intervention and the acceptability of therapy to children and their parents must also be examined.<BR/>

<P>An earlier version of this review (New Reference) included measures of speech function (respiration, phonation, resonance, articulation and prosody) as primary outcome measures. These outcomes are secondary outcomes in this review. Primary outcomes in this review comprise speech intelligibility and communicative participation only. Quality of life was not considered in the original version of the review but has been added as secondary outcome in this version. </P>

4-point GRBAS scale, effect size 0.4). No other differences in voice quality were perceived. Aesthenia was weakly associated with reduced intelligibility (R -0.11, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.15, with -10.7% reduction in intelligibility with an increase of 
1 point on the aesthenia rating scale). No association between change in intelligibility and any other GRBAS ratings

<TD>
<P>First block of therapy focused on increasing control of oral movement used in articulation, chewing and expiration. Second block of therapy focused on controlling exhalation for speech and co-ordination of exhalation and phonation; voice training; and prosody (intonation, pausing, rhythm and sound duration). In the second block of therapy advice was given to parents on stimulating communication, and children engaged in story telling and recall to practice their speech skills with their parents.<BR/>Whilst receiving the above therapies children also received Bobath neurodevelopmental treatment
