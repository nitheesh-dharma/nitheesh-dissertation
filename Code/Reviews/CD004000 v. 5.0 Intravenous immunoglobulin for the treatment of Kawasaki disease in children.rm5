<P>Good evidence that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment within the first 10 days of symptoms reduces coronary artery abnormalities (heart damage) in children with Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is a disease that primarily affects children under five years old. The cause of Kawasaki disease is not known. Its symptoms are persistent fever, red eyes and lips, strawberry tongue, rash and swollen lymph nodes. If not detected and treated immediately, Kawasaki disease can result in heart damage and occasionally death. Intravenous immunoglobulin involves injecting antibodies purified from donated blood. The review of trials found that intravenous immunoglobulin given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries of the heart in children, without serious adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-26 15:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. The coronary arteries supplying the heart can be damaged in Kawasaki disease. The principal advantage of timely diagnosis is the potential to prevent this complication with early treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is widely used for this purpose.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of IVIG in treating, and preventing cardiac consequences, of Kawasaki disease in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-25 15:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic searches of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Disease Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were performed (last searched March 2003). We also searched references from relevant articles and contacted authors where necessary. In addition we contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of intravenous immunoglobulin to treat Kawasaki disease were eligible for inclusion.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Fifty-nine trials were identified in the initial search. On careful inspection only sixteen of these met all the inclusion criteria. Trials were data extracted and assessed for quality by at least two reviewers. Data were combined for meta-analysis using relative risk ratios for dichotomous data or weighted mean difference for continuous data. A random effects statistical model was used.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The meta-analysis of IVIG versus placebo, including all children, showed a significant decrease in new coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) in favour of IVIG, at thirty days RR (95% CI) = 0.74 (0.61 to 0.90). No statistically significant difference was found thereafter. A subgroup analysis excluding children with CAAs at enrolment also found a significant reduction of new CAAs in children receiving IVIG RR (95%) = 0.67 (0.46 to 1.00). There was a trend towards benefit from IVIG at sixty days (p=0.06).</P>
<P>Results of dose comparisons showed a decrease in the number of new CAAs with increased dose. The meta-analysis of 400 mg/kg/day for five days versus 2 gm/kg in a single dose showed statistically significant reduction in CAAs at thirty days RR (95%) = 4.47 (1.55 to 12.86). This comparison also showed a significant reduction in duration of fever with the higher dose.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference noted between different preparations of IVIG.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference of adverse effects in any group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Children fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease should be treated with IVIG (2 gm/kg single dose) within 10 days of onset of symptoms. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-25 15:35:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Kawasaki disease, or mucocutaneous lymphnode syndrome is a systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), which predominantly affects children under the age of five years (<LINK REF="REF-Royle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 1998</LINK>). It was first described by Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 (<LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 1967</LINK>). Despite subsequent advances in treatment and research exploring a superantigen-mediated role in the development of Kawasaki disease (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1995</LINK>), its cause remains unknown. However, epidemiological studies support an infectious agent inducing the disease in a genetically susceptible minority (<LINK REF="REF-Harnden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harnden 2002</LINK>). Reported incidence rates differ considerably throughout the developed world with rates in Japan 10 times those in the United States and 30 times those in the United Kingdom and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanagawa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanagawa 2001</LINK>). World wide mortality rates also vary between 0.08% in Japan to 3.7% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1993</LINK>). It is unclear whether mortality reflects intrinsic severity of disease and/or early recognition and delivery of effective treatment.</P>
<P>The most important complication, inflammation of the coronary arteries leading to formation of aneurysms, occurs in 20-30% of untreated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 1995</LINK>). Thrombosis within an aneurysm, myocardial infarction, and dysrhythmias (disordered rhythm of the heart) may occur in the acute phase of the illness. Patients may also suffer long term morbidity as a result of scarring of coronary arteries, thickening of the inner wall of the arteries, and accelerated atherosclerosis.</P>
<P>There is no diagnostic test for the disease, and many cases are missed (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1995</LINK>). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria such as that summarized by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1993 (<LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1993</LINK>). These include fever for five or more days, polymorphous exanthem (a rash of indefinite or variable appearance), nonpurulent conjunctivitis, changes in the lips or oral cavity, redness and oedema with later desquamation (peeling of the skin) of the extremities, and at least one cervical lymph node that is &gt;1.5 cm in diameter. The diagnosis is made when the child has five days of fever, four of the other five findings, and no evidence of another disease with similar clinical features. However, many common childhood infections do have similar clinical features. Furthermore, the diagnostic features of Kawasaki disease may appear sequentially rather than simultaneously. The two features that doctors most often remember are desquamation of the rash and increased numbers of platelets in the blood stream (thrombocytosis). Unfortunately, these features are the least useful in reaching an early diagnosis because they usually occur later in the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1997</LINK>). Moreover, the clinical diagnostic criteria do not identify every case; "incomplete" or "atypical" cases have come to light because coronary artery aneurysms have been found on echocardiography or at autopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Rowley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowley 1987</LINK>). One study has shown that more patients with partial findings developed coronary artery abnormalities than did those with the full clinical picture (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 1999</LINK>). As a result of this, many feel justified in making a diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease even when children do not meet all the AHA criteria. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>For each included trial, information was collected regarding location of the study, methods of the study (as per quality assessment checklist), participants characteristics (age range, eligibility criteria), types of interventions and outcomes. Where possible, missing data were sought from the authors. Data extraction was performed independently by at least two reviewers. No discrepancies were experienced.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>Each dichotomous outcome was measured for effect in terms of relative risk, with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method. Where there were sufficient data, a summary statistic for each outcome was calculated using a random effects model. The results in the "Comparison and data table" section of this review are presented using a random effects model. The heterogeneity of the studies was analysed by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in the confidence intervals and more formally by checking the results of the chi-squared test.</P>
<P>A <I>priori</I>, sensitivity analysis using only trials with documented diagnostic criteria was conducted. The trials that did document this all used the same criteria.</P>
<P>Continuous outcomes between groups in the meta-analysis are shown as a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval. A random approach has been used as heterogeneity was detected.</P>
<P>Some papers reported multiple trials. When this was the case, the separate trials were entered into the "Comparison and data table" by author, followed by date, followed by either A, B or C (where A is the earliest of the trials documented) i.e. Smith 1990A, Smith 1990B, Smith 1990C. Because it is only possible to analyse two comparisons in RevMan at one time, where there were three arms in the comparison being made (e.g. 100 mg/kg/day IVIG versus 200 mg/kg/day IVIG versus 400 mg/kg/day IVIG, this is indicated by a number following either the date or the indication of multiple studies in one paper (e.g. Smith 1990(1), Smith 1990(2), Smith 1990(3) OR Smith 1990A(1), Smith 1990A(2), Smith 1990A(3)). When there were multiple treatment arms in a study with a common control the control numbers were divided equally between the arms. If the control group contained an uneven number of participants so that numbers could not be equally divided, then the analysis was done in both ways to detect possible differences in the results caused by an unequal division of the numerator and denominator.</P>
<P>The main analyses were based on 19 trials although not all trials assessed all of the outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed on:<BR/>1) comparisons of dose<BR/>2) comparisons of type of IVIG</P>
<P>It is the intention of the reviewers that a new search for RCTs will be performed yearly and the review updated accordingly.</P>

<P>Harada's score<B>
<BR/>
</B>Harada's score has been used to try to identify those children at highest risk of acquiring coronary artery abnormalities when suffering from Kawasaki disease, Children are scored on the following:<BR/>1) white blood count &#8805; 12,000 cu mm;<BR/>2) platelet count &lt; 350,000 cu mm;<BR/>3) C reactive protein &#8805; 3+;<BR/>4) hematocrit &lt;35%;<BR/>5) albumin &lt; 3.5g/dl;<BR/>6) age 12 months;<BR/>7) male.<BR/>A score of four or more is felt to indicate that a child is at high risk of developing CAAs.</P>
<P>Two trials (two comparisons) applied this score prior to randomisation to ascertain which children should be randomised to receive one of two treatment regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Sato-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1999</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin in treating Kawasaki disease in children. The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in new CAAs at thirty days in favour of IVIG plus salicylate over salicylate alone, and also in favour of a single high dose regime over four or five day low dose regime. There was also a significant decrease in duration of fever and duration of hospitalisation, with no statistically significant increase in adverse events. The results did not differ when children with coronary artery abnormalities at presentation were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>The included trials comparing IVIG and salicylate with salicylate alone compared markedly different doses and dose regimes. This is likely to have accounted for some of the observed heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analysis of the six studies including documentation of the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki Disease suggested this may also have accounted for some of the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sato-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1999</LINK>), used a "Harada Score" to identify those at very low risk of acquiring a CAA when suffering from Kawasaki disease, who did not receive IVIG therapy. Both of these two studies reported an untreated group of forty-six children and fifty-eight children respectively, with low Harada scores, in whom none had any coronary artery abnormality on follow up. A much larger cohort study of untreated children with low scores would be required in order to confirm the safety of this approach.</P>
<P>Atypical or incomplete Kawasaki Disease has been described in children not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria but still having coronary artery changes (<LINK REF="REF-Rowley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuh-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuh 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1990</LINK>). None of the included studies provides any direct evidence of the benefit of IVIG in such circumstances.</P>
<P>No studies enrolled patients who were more than ten days beyond the onset of symptoms.</P>
<P>IVIG does not appear to be associated with an increase in adverse events. Few studies explicitly stated that they were reporting deaths. Only one death was reported in all the included studies. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Children fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease should be treated with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (2 gm/kg single dose) within 10 days of onset of symptoms.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research is needed to determine the benefit from immunoglobulin therapy in children with atypical and late presentation.</P>
