<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 10:58:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the early 1950s the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia has been the typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Although they are effective in controlling voices and delusions for many people with schizophrenia, they have a smaller effect on symptoms such as apathy and social withdrawal. They also have disabling adverse effects such as tremor, stiffness and slowing of movement. The newer drugs, such as olanzapine, are reputed to have fewer adverse motor effects and are as effective, if not more so, than the older drugs. This review examines the randomised controlled trials of olanzapine compared with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>Most of the studies in this review were either sponsored by or run by the pharmaceutical companies responsible for the marketing of these drugs. Olanzapine seems to be an effective antipsychotic that produces less adverse effects for movement. It does however tend to cause more weight gain than the older drugs. Its effectiveness appears similar to other atypical drugs and it is not markedly beneficial for apathy, demotivation and social withdrawal.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic reported to be effective without producing disabling extrapyramidal adverse effects associated with older, typical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical effects and safety of olanzapine compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We updated the first search [Biological Abstracts (1980-1999), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), PsycLIT (1974-1999) and The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2000)] in October 2004 using the Cochrane Schizophrenia's Group's register of trials. We also searched references of all included studies for further trials, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised clinical trials comparing olanzapine with placebo or any antipsychotic treatment for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently extracted data and, for homogeneous dichotomous data, calculated the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data we calculated weighted mean differences.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifty five trials are included (total n&gt;10000 people with schizophrenia). Attrition from olanzapine versus placebo studies was &gt;50% by six weeks, leaving interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine appeared superior to placebo at six weeks for the outcome of 'no important clinical response' (any dose, 2 RCTs n=418, RR 0.88 CI 0.8 to 0.1, NNT 8 CI 5 to 27). Although dizziness and dry mouth were reported more frequently in the olanzapine-treated group, this did not reach statistical significance. The olanzapine group gained more weight. </P>
<P>When compared with typical antipsychotic drugs, data from several small trials are incomplete. With high attrition in both groups (14 RCTs, n=3344, 38% attrition by six weeks, RR 0.81 CI 0.65 to 1.02) the assumptions included in all data are considerable. For the short term outcome of 'no important clinical response', olanzapine seems as effective as typical antipsychotics (4 RCTs, n=2778, RR 0.90 CI 0.76 to 1.06). People allocated olanzapine experienced fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than those given typical antipsychotics. Weight change data for the short term are not statistically significant but results between three to 12 months suggest a clinically important average gain of four kilograms for people given olanzapine (4 RCTs, n=186, WMD 4.62, CI 0.6 to 8.64). </P>
<P>Twenty three percent of people in trials of olanzapine and other atypical drugs left by eight weeks; 48% by three to12 months (11 RCTs, n=1847, RR 0.91 CI 0.82 to 1.00). There is little to choose between the atypicals, although olanzapine may cause fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than other drugs in this category. Olanzapine produces more weight gain than other atypicals with some differences reaching conventional levels of statistical significance (1 RCT, n=980, RR gain at 2 years 1.73 CI 1.49 to 2.00, NNH 5 CI 4 to 7). There are very few data for people with first episode illness (1 RCT, duration 6 weeks, n=42). For people with treatment-resistant illness there were no clear differences between olanzapine and clozapine (4 RCTs, n=457).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The large proportion of participants leaving studies early in these trials makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on olanzapine's clinical effects. For people with schizophrenia it may offer antipsychotic efficacy with fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than typical drugs, but more weight gain. There is a need for further large, long-term randomised trials with more comprehensive data.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 11:06:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia since the 1950s. These conventional antipsychotics are largely effective against the 'positive' symptoms such as fixed false beliefs (delusions) and perceptions without a cause (hallucinations). They seem relatively ineffective against the 'negative' symptoms of schizophrenia (apathy, slowing and paucity of movement and thought). It is believed that the conventional or 'typical' antipsychotics exert their antipsychotic effect by blocking specific sites in the brain (dopamine D2 receptors - <LINK REF="REF-Seeman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeman 1987</LINK>). However, this D2 blockade is also responsible for the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms, such as stiffness, tremor, repetitive movements (parkinsonism), that may contribute to poor compliance with medication.</P>
<P>The search for antipsychotic agents to manage both 'positive' and 'negative' symptoms has produced a class of drugs called 'atypical' antipsychotics. These compounds, including olanzapine, are purported to have addressed the limitations of traditional antipsychotics by promising better efficacy and/or adverse effect profiles (<LINK REF="REF-McEwan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwan 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Recent research suggests that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is likely to be heterogeneous and may involve neurotransmitter systems other than D2 receptors. <LINK REF="REF-Tamminga-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamminga 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1998</LINK> suggested that the addition of 5-HT2 antagonists, for example ritanserin, to traditional anti dopamine-D2 drug therapy improved negative symptoms and attenuate pre-existing drug-induced extrapyramidal effects (<LINK REF="REF-Tamminga-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamminga 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is an 'atypical' antipsychotic showing affinity at D1-D5, serotinergic (5HT2,3,6), muscarinic (subtypes 1-5), adrenergic (alpha 1-2) and histaminergic (H1) binding sites (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>(HGAJ), <LINK REF="STD-Reus-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Reus 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1997</LINK>). It is structurally similar to clozapine but has a slightly different binding site affinity. It is weaker than clozapine as an alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic agonist relative to D2, D4 or 5HT2a antagonism.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review is to determine the clinical effects of olanzapine compared with placebo, typical antipsychotic agents, and other atypical antipsychotics, for treating schizophrenia and related psychoses. </P>
<P>As secondary objectives, we also investigated:<BR/>1. whether people with schizophrenia described as 'treatment resistant' differed in their treatment response from those whose illness was not classified as such<BR/>2. whether people having predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia were more responsive to olanzapine than those without this classification<BR/>3. whether people experiencing their first episode of a psychotic illness differed in response from those with a previous history.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was only implied that the study was randomised, these trials were included in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see types of outcome measures) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials were used and the results of the sensitivity analysis described in the text. Quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included people with schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders). There is no clear evidence that the schizophrenia-like psychoses are caused by fundamentally different disease processes or require different treatment approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. Selection of studies <BR/>We (LD, MF) independently inspected all reports of identified studies. It was usually possible to resolve any disagreement by consensus; however, where doubt remained we acquired the full article. We independently decided whether these met the review criteria. No blinding to the names of authors, institutions and journal of publication took place. Again, we resolved any disagreements by consensus. When this proved impossible, we sought further information and, in the interim, added these trials to the 'Awaiting assessment' list. LD, MF and JR independently inspected citations from the subsequent updated search (2004) and identified relevant abstracts. We obtained and inspected full reports of the abstracts meeting the review criteria. </P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). We only included trials in Category A or B in the review. </P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction <BR/>We independently extracted data and resolved disagreement by discussion. When this was not possible we sought further information from trial authors.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis <BR/>Where possible we analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and assumed that those who had not been accounted for had the less positive outcome. This rule did not include the outcome of 'death'. We tested this assumption with a sensitivity analysis. For continuous data it is impossible to manage the data in this way therefore we presented 'completer' data. Where feasible, we converted continuous scores to dichotomous data. </P>
<P>If, for a given outcome, more than 50% of the total numbers randomised were not accounted for, we did not present results as such data are impossible to interpret with authority. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked data with '*' to indicate the result may well be prone to bias.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>When summation was appropriate, with binary outcomes such as improved/not improved, we calculated the relative risk (RR) statistic with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and used a random effects model. In addition, as a measure of efficiency, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) from the pooled totals.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Normally distributed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data are presented in the 'Other data' tables rather than included in the analysis. </P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Again, without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we have presented only endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this, much of the published change data could have been excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We contacted authors of studies that only reported change for endpoint figures. </P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again this was based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. We did not consider continuous data presented without use of summary statistics (i.e. mean, SD, SE, median, interquartile range), although we noted the existence of these data in the text.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Valid Scales<BR/>Many rating scales are available to measure outcomes in mental health trials (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). These scales vary in quality and many are poorly validated. It is generally accepted that measuring instruments should have the properties of reliability (the extent to which a test effectively measures anything at all) and validity (the extent to which a test measures that which it is supposed to measure). Before publication of an instrument, most scientific journals insist that its reliability and validity be demonstrated to the satisfaction of referees. As a minimum standard, we excluded data from unpublished rating scales. In addition, the rating scale should be either: (i) a self report; or (ii) completed by an independent rater or relative. More stringent standards for instruments may be set in future editions of this review.</P>
<P>Continuous data may be presented from different scales, rating the same outcome. In this event, we presented all data without summation and inspected the general direction of effect.</P>
<P>4.2.4 Conversion to a common metric<BR/>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables (such as days in hospital) that could be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month). </P>
<P>4.3 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. </P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We then visually inspected the graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity and supplemented this using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than to chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency had been high, data would not have been summated, but we would have presented them separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity. </P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered all data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>7. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for olanzapine.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of studies please see Included and Excluded studies tables. </P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>When this review was first undertaken we excluded a total of over 160 studies. Of these, more than 60 were excluded because they were not randomised trials, including nine open-label, single-arm studies supplied by Eli Lilly. Nine were review articles and one reported validity data for a questionnaire. Twelve studies did not include people with schizophrenia. More than 70 studies presented outcomes that were not usable. One study was originally excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>) following the withdrawal of the study by Janssen-Cilag. Amended data have now been presented and are included (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>). For the 2004 update, even fewer studies were added to the excluded studies due to the increasing specificity of the Cochrane Schizophrenia register of controlled trials.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment <BR/>No studies are waiting assessment. </P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>Eight RCTs comparing olanzapine with other antipsychotics are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Centorrino-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Centorrino 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Krakowski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krakowski 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramamurthy-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramamurthy 2000a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reveley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reveley 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2000b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>Fifty five studies are included in the October 2004 update and this represents an additional 26 studies since the 2003 update. These 55 studies randomised over 10000 people with schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders. All included studies are reported as randomised and all but 16 are described as double blind. In almost half of the studies, Eli Liiy (the pharmaceutical company that produces olanzapine) carried out randomisation at the individual investigation sites; Janssen-Cilag undertook randomisation in the <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> study. For the remaining included studies, no additional information is available. </P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness that affects young people. Thirty one studies presented data on 'short-term' follow-up (less than three months). Three of these acute phase studies (Beasley 1996a (HGAD), Beasley 1997 (E003), Tomlinson 1997(HGAJ)) lasted six weeks with 'responders' entering a 46-week extension. Tomlinsons (HGDY) study was the shortest trial (three to five days) following abrupt discontinuation of cocaine. Twenty three studies fell into the 'medium term' (three to 12 months) category and only two trials (Jones 1998 (P022), Meltzer (Intercept)) fulfilled our criterion for 'long-term' (more than one year). The included trials of treatment resistant patients provided only short-term and medium-term data.</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>All but eleven studies included participants with operationalised diagnoses (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jakovljevic1999-HGCH" TYPE="STUDY">Jakovljevic1999 HGCH</LINK>, Jones 1998 (P022), <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK>) by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (<LINK REF="REF-ICD_x002d_10" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD-10</LINK>). The participants in all studies bar one were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, although twelve studies also included people with schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform psychosis. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK> used CLMD-3 (Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders Version 3). <LINK REF="STD-HGCQ-_x0028_Turkey_x0029_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HGCQ (Turkey) 2000</LINK> did not mention the diagnosis but Eli Lilly listed the study's participants as suffering from 'schizophrenia and related psychoses' and hence it is included. As <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> only allowed women of 'childbearing potential' to enter after approximately two-thirds of the enrolment had been completed the participants were predominantly male. <LINK REF="STD-Svestka-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Svestka 2003</LINK> recruited only women.</P>
<P>The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> were less severely ill than was generally seen in the other studies (mean BPRS score at baseline in the olanzapine group: <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> - 33.1, <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> - 42.6, <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1997-_x0028_E003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1997 (E003)</LINK> - 42.3, <LINK REF="STD-Jakovljevic1999-HGCH" TYPE="STUDY">Jakovljevic1999 HGCH</LINK> - 43.7). This large study also contained a large number of people who were intolerant of their current medication. </P>
<P>Four studies selected people whose illness was described as resistant to treatment (Beuzen 1998 (HGCF), Bitter 2004 (HGCK), <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2003</LINK>). All used different definitions of treatment resistance and treatment intolerance as set out in the included studies table.</P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Twenty two trials took place in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Eighteen used an inpatient design and only five studies an outpatient setting. Eleven studies did not report the setting. </P>
<P>4.4 Study size <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> was by far the largest study (1996 participants) whilst <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2003</LINK> was the smallest study, randomising only 13 people. Seventeen studies had fewer than fifty participants, eleven had between 50 and 100 participants, 24 studies had between 100 and 400 participants and four randomised more than four hundred people. There were no cluster trials.</P>
<P>4.5 Intervention<BR/>The trialists gave olanzapine in a wide range of doses from 1mg/day to 50 mg/day. <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996b-_x0028_HGAP_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996b (HGAP)</LINK> used 1 mg/day stating that this was equivalent to a placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1997-_x0028_E003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1997 (E003)</LINK>, however, started with the same assertion but altered this during the study. Because of this we stopped using 1mg/day as additional placebo data. </P>
<P>The comparators were placebo, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, fluphenazine, flupentixol, perphenazine, clozapine, amisulpride, risperidone, zisprasidone, aripiprazole and sonepiprazole. (Pharmacia Corporation recently announced that it was discontinuing the development of the atypical antipsychotic sonepiprazole (PNU 101387)).</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>4.6.1 Improvement - Definition of improvement often consisted of a 20-40% reduction in BPRS or PANSS scores. For treatment resistant participants, the lower level of change in mental state scores was considered as an improvement. Individual papers reported different cut offs for improvement. Pragmatic outcomes were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> (suicide attempt, death by suicide, change in hospital status etc.).</P>
<P>Studies often dichotomised their overall measure of efficacy from continuous scales (BPRS, PANSS). This dichotomising is welcome as data begins to become clinically understandable. It is, however, wasteful of time and effort, if a simple yes/no question on clinical efficacy would suffice rather than hundreds of BPRS and PANSS questions. The validity of dichotomising is unclear.</P>
<P>Seven studies supplied by Eli Lilly, present data for loss to follow up and adverse effects. As far as we understand, effects on global functioning and mental state are not currently available, even to the funding company. We have contacted Eli Lilly to ascertain exactly what outcomes were recorded in addition to those for which data are available, but have not received a response to date. However, additional data is included in this update from three studies <LINK REF="STD-HGCQ-_x0028_Turkey_x0029_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HGCQ (Turkey) 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-HGDV-_x0028_Morocco_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">HGDV (Morocco) 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Loza-1999-_x0028_HGDT_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Loza 1999 (HGDT)</LINK>. </P>
<P>4.6.2 Adverse effects - Many studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies reported data only when the differing incidence was statistically significant. The authors regarded these data as potentially misleading, as chance events were likely to be given prominence and equally frequent adverse effects to be ignored. Eli Lilly provided published and unpublished adverse event data from the COSTART terms. These have been included in this version of the review. <BR/> <BR/>4.6.3 Outcome scales - Details of scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusion of data from other instruments are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' section.</P>
<P>4.6.3.1 Global state scales<BR/>4.6.3.1.1 Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement. </P>
<P>4.6.3.2 Mental state scales<BR/>4.6.3.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. Four studies extracted the BPRS scores from the PANSS <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996b-_x0028_HGAP_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996b (HGAP)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1997-_x0028_E003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1997 (E003)</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-COSTART-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">COSTART 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK>. We have not found any validation of this method of extracting scores. </P>
<P>4.6.3.2.2 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) <BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on people already diagnosed as suffering from an affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring the person at the same interview. The scores of the person are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. High scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms. </P>
<P>4.6.3.2.3 Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale - HAMA (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1969</LINK>)<BR/>The Hamilton Anxiety Scaleis a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology, often used in psychotropic drug evaluation. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). The 14 items consist of: Anxious Mood, Tension, Fears, Insomnia, Intellectual, Depressed Mood, Somatic Complaints (Muscular), Somatic Complaints (Sensory), Cardiovascular Symptoms, Respiratory Symptoms, Gastrointestinal symptoms, Genitourinary symptoms, Autonomic Symptom and Behaviour at Interview.<BR/>

<BR/>
</B>4.6.3.2.4 Mini Mental State Examination - MMSE (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>)<BR/>This clinician-administered clinical evaluation assesses cognition in five areas: orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall, and language. The test takes 15 minutes to administer and the score ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 30 (normal). </P>
<P>4.6.3.2.5 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. It can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity. </P>
<P>4.6.3.2.6 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of the following negative symptoms; alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. </P>
<P>4.6.3.2.7 Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale - MADRS (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>) <BR/>A 65-item comprehensive psychopathology scale was used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness. Ratings are based on 10 items, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. </P>
<P>4.6.3.2.7 Subjective Well-being on Neuroleptics Scale - SWN (<LINK REF="REF-de-Haan-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haan 2002a</LINK>)<BR/>The SWN is an instrument to measure the subtle subjective changes, such as restrictions in emotionality, the clarity of thinking and spontaneity that are often referred to as 'pharmacogenic depression' or the 'neuroleptic induced deficit syndrome'. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3 Adverse effects scales<BR/>4.6.3.3.1 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This has been used to assess tardive dyskinesia, a long-term, drug-induced movement disorder and short-term movement disorders such as tremor. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.2 Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (<LINK REF="REF-AMDP_x002d_5-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMDP-5 1981</LINK>)<BR/>This is a 40-item adverse event questionnaire. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.3 Barnes Akathisia Scale - BAS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The scale comprises items rating the observable, restless movements that characterise akathisia, a subjective awareness of restlessness, and any distress associated with the condition. These items are rated from 0 - normal to 3 - severe. In addition, there is an item for rating global severity (from 0 - absent to 5 - severe). A low score indicates low levels of akathisia. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.4 COSTART Terms (<LINK REF="REF-COSTART-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">COSTART 1990</LINK>)<BR/>This is a list drawn up by the US Food and Drug Administration in order to help consistent description of adverse reactions. It is not a scoring system. Eighteen studies reported usable data.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3.5 Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale - DIEPSS (<LINK REF="REF-Inada-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inada 1996</LINK>)<BR/>This is a nine item scale used to assess the extrapyramidal syndromes parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinsia. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.6 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items), and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.7 Hillside Akathisia Scale - HAS (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The Hillside Akathisia Scale (HAS) has two subjective and three objective items for which anchored rating points are provided.</P>
<P>4.6.3.3.8 Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This ten-item scale, with a scoring system of 0-4 for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a short-term drug-induced movement disorder. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.9 UKU Side Effects Rating Scale - UKU-SERS (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerde 1987</LINK>)<BR/>The UKU rates four major topics: psychological side effects (10 items), neurological side effects (eight items), autonomic side effects (11 items) and other side effects (19 items). Each item is defined by means of a four-point scale where zero means not/doubtfully present. Scoring range is 0-144. </P>
<P>4.6.3.3.10 Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionaire - LSEQ (<LINK REF="REF-Parrott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrott 1980</LINK>)<BR/>The SEQ is a simple 10 item bipolar VAS type questionnaire that can be used to evaluate sedative effects in psychotropic drugs. Four areas are tapped 1) sleep onset, 2) quality of sleep, 3) ease of awakening and 4) integrity of morning behaviour. The SEQ has been factor analysed and four factors were identified, 1) getting asleep, 2) perceived sleep quality, 3) awakening and 4) early morning behaviour. A high score indicates improvement.</P>

This is rated on a seven-point scale, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. </P>
<P>4.6.3.4.2 Quality of Life Scale - QLS (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This semi-structured interview is administered and rated by trained clinicians. It contains 21 items rated on a seven-point scale based on the interviewer's judgement of patient functioning. A total QLS and four sub-scale scores are calculated, with higher scores indicating less impairment. </P>
<P>4.6.3.5 Satisfaction<BR/>4.6.3.5.1 Van Putten Scale<BR/>This is designed to measure patient satisfaction with treatment. This was used in the <LINK REF="STD-HGCQ-_x0028_Turkey_x0029_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HGCQ (Turkey) 2000</LINK> study. A fuller description of this scale is being sought.</P>
<P>4.6.3.5.2 Drug Attitude Inventory - DAI-30 (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This is a self-report 30-item scale for assessing patient satisfaction with antipsychotic treatment in-patients with schizophrenia. This inventory is designed to measure the person's subjective responses to medications as well as values and attitudes toward illness and health. Higher scores indicate a more favourable attitude towards antipsychotic drug treatment. A positive total final score means a positive subjective response (compliant). A negative total score means a negative subjective response (non-compliant). </P>
<P>5. Missing outcomes<BR/>Only Beasley 1996a (HGAD), <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> reported hospital admission data. No useful data about daily functioning, such as 'employed' or 'trouble with the police', or satisfaction with care was reported. Eli Lilly provided economic data and this will be incorporated into further updates of the review. Six studies reported mortality data.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>Reporting of randomisation seemed poor in the published papers. As studies have shown that poor reporting of randomisation increases the odds of presenting 'significant' outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) this was brought to the attention of the companies responsible for the trials (Eli Lilly and Janssen-Cilag). They have since provided full reports of randomisation and the studies now fall into quality category A (adequate concealment of allocation). Eli Lilly randomised using computer-generated blocks, for investigative sites or investigator and concealed randomisation from the investigators. Janssen-Cilag used a randomisation ratio of 1:1 using the minimisation technique of Pocock and Simon (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1975</LINK>) and a dynamic randomisation procedure stratified by body mass index (BMI), PANSS total and ESRS scores.</P>
<P>2. Blinding to interventions and outcomes<BR/>Again authors poorly reported their blinding procedures with only (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>) clearly describing adequate precautions. Eli Lilly and Janssen-Cilag supplied us with details of blinding that we have included in the 'Included studies' table. Several studies gave people a medication kit containing their medication of allocation in a form that was not clearly different from the comparison drug or used identical capsules (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>). No study tested blinding. <LINK REF="STD-He-2003" TYPE="STUDY">He 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> were not blind.</P>
<P>3. Follow-up<BR/>The numbers leaving the study early were high, albeit comparable to trials of other atypical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Fabre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabre 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Srisurapanont-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srisurapanont 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2003</LINK>). The majority of trials that had been published in peer reviewed journals described the participant disposition well, clearly informing the reader as to individual reasons for withdrawal from the study. Studies that had been presented as posters or presentations often did not include data on the follow-up of participants, leaving the reader uninformed as to the whereabouts of the participants.</P>
<P>Nearly all the studies stated that they analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis using the last observation carried forward. This practice may well overestimate any treatment effect. Once participants leave a study, unless the trialists continue to follow and collect data, assumptions have to be made about outcome. As many people left these studies early, the results do incorporate considerable assumptions (see 'Results', 'Discussion' and 'Implications for research'). Eli Lilly kindly provided drop out data from their trials.</P>
<P>In this review those leaving the studies early were classified as a 'bad outcome' and analysed accordingly (except for the outcome of death). Whatever the management of lost data, interpretation of results with large degrees of attrition must be undertaken with caution. Where greater than 50% of those randomised were lost to follow up, outcomes are marked with '*' in order to draw the attention of the reader to the 'prone to bias' footnote in the graphical display of results.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>We found more than 800 citations using the search strategies and 55 studies for inclusion. Twenty six of these are additional studies in the 2004 update. Eli Lilly identified 11 randomised controlled trials, four of which were unpublished data on file. We found many trials reported as presentations at conferences or meetings with the full report being published in an academic journal (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). There is a close correlation between study size and number of presentations. If regression analysis of the data in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> is undertaken on a log-graph the least-squares line makes a close fit (R2=0.92). For every 10 people that are randomised in an olanzapine versus typical drugs comparison there is a report. A study of 10 could be predicted to merit a report, of 100-110 presentations and of 1000-1100 reports. Considering the likely under-identification of presentations of the larger studies this pattern of comprehensive dissemination does not seem too unlikely. Janssen-Cilag withdrew data from <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> in April 1999, due to site irregularities. It has now been published and is included in this review. </P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1. OLANZAPINE versus PLACEBO<BR/>Five trials used placebo groups in their comparisons (Beasley 1996a (HGAD), Beasley 1996b (HGAP), <LINK REF="STD-Corrigan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Corrigan 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK>, Tollefson 1999(HGDY)). <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1999_x0028_HGDY_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1999(HGDY)</LINK> is so short term (duration five days) that we have reported data in a separate comparison. The loss to follow up in the other four studies is such that most data within this comparison is marked with '*' and 'prone to bias' in the graphical presentations. The degree of assumption within these data is very great and must be interpreted with a high degree of caution. <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1999_x0028_HGDY_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1999(HGDY)</LINK> was the only trial to have small numbers of people leaving, but this trial lasted for just five days.</P>
<P>2.1 Global effect<BR/>2.1.1 No important clinical response<BR/>The trialists defined 'no important clinical response' as the number of people per treatment group who did not present at least a 40% reduction in psychotic symptoms measured by any scale. Olanzapine was superior to placebo at six weeks (any dose, 2 RCTs, n=418, RR 0.88 CI 0.8 to 0.1, NNT 8 CI 5 to 27). When analysed by dose, greatest effect occurred at 15 mg/day olanzapine (1 RCT n=137, RR 0.74 CI 0.6 to 0.1, NNT 5 CI 3 to 42), was smaller for 10 mg/day (2 RCTs, n=232, RR 0.8 CI 0.7 to 0.1, NNT 7 CI 4 to 40) and lost in the single study that reported data on 5 mg/day (1 RCT, n=133, RR 0.94 CI 0.7-1.2) and 1 mg/day (1 RCT, n=102, RR 0.98 CI 0.9 to 1.1).</P>
<P>2.1.2 Change in overall state as measured at endpoint by CGI (Clinical Global Impression)<BR/>CGI continuous data shows a significant difference in favour of olanzapine (2 RCTs, n=230, WMD (weighted mean difference) -0.53, CI -0.89 to -0.17). </P>
<P>2.1.3 Needing additional benzodiazepines<BR/>At six weeks, similar proportions of each group had received benzodiazepines as an additional medication (2 RCTs, n=418, RR 0.96 CI 0.9 to 1.1).<BR/> <BR/>2.2 Mental state<BR/>2.2.1 Total scores<BR/>At six weeks global measures of mental state favoured olanzapine over placebo. Both non-skewed BPRS total and PANSS total data favoured olanzapine (by about seven points on BPRS (1 RCT, n=98, MD -6.86 CI -12.3 to -1.38) and 12 points (1 RCT, n=98, MD -12.43 CI -22.54to -2.32) on PANSS. <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> reported skewed data for the BPRS scale. These are not graphically displayed. </P>
<P>2.2.2 Negative/positive sub-scores<BR/>The SANS, a scale specifically designed and validated for reporting negative symptoms showed no difference in olanzapine and placebo groups (1 RCT, n=94, MD -0.50, CI -2.87 to 1.87). The PANSS negative sub-scale score was also equivocal. Skewed data from the negative sub-scores of the BPRS and SANS tended to favour olanzapine but differences were not significant.</P>
<P>Positive symptoms were measured using sub-scores of the BPRS and PANSS. Skewed data from the former are difficult to interpret but one study reported PANSS data that suggest a statistically significant advantage for olanzapine of four points (n=98, MD -4.0 CI -7.10 to -0.90).<BR/> <BR/>2.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>2.3.1 Any reason<BR/>In the short term (six weeks), the levels of attrition reported by Beasley 1996a (HGAD), <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996b-_x0028_HGAP_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996b (HGAP)</LINK> were similarly high, olanzapine (52%) placebo (53%). Pooling the data favoured olanzapine (3 RCTs, n=598, RR 0.86 CI 0.75 to 0.98, NNT 14 CI 8 to 95). Nevertheless, these attrition rates are considerable. <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> reported a maintenance phase. This study counted people as 'dropouts' if they were ineligible, or eligible and unwilling, to continue the study medication beyond the acute phase (six weeks). At the start of the maintenance phase, 153/198 of those taking olanzapine and 55/68 had left the study (RR 0.96 CI 0.8 to 1.1). At 52 weeks only 17 people on olanzapine and two on placebo were continuing within their allocated groups (RR 0.94 CI 0.9 to 1.0). The data at six months are equivocal from <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK>. </P>
<P>2.3.2 Due to lack of efficacy<BR/>Participants taking olanzapine were significantly less likely to leave studies early due to lack of efficacy at six weeks (RR 0.61 CI 0.43 to 0.89, NNT 7 CI 5 to124). <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK> data at six months are equivocal. At one year those who entered the maintenance phase of the original six-week acute phase study (Beasley 1996a (HGAD)), however, were significantly less likely to leave the study early due to lack of efficacy (n=58, RR 0.41 CI 0.2 to 0.9, NNT 3 CI 2 to 52). </P>
<P>2.4 Adverse effects<BR/>We did not agree with some of the trialists' criteria for adverse events. For example 'exacerbation of schizophrenia' is classed as adverse event in <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996b-_x0028_HGAP_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996b (HGAP)</LINK>. This is reported as 'lack of efficacy' in this review and strengthens the assertion that adding those who left the study early to the adverse outcome may be justified. In these trials, adverse events needed to reach a frequency of at least 10% or be statistically significant before being reported. As a result of this, less common, but possibly important adverse effects were not reported. </P>
<P>2.4.1 Anticholinergic effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> reported that dry mouth and dizziness, especially, were more frequent in the olanzapine treated group, although neither difference reached conventional levels of statistical significance. </P>
<P>2.4.2 Extrapyramidal effects<BR/>The need for anticholinergic medication, used as a proxy-measure for extrapyramidal adverse effects, was the same in those allocated to olanzapine and those taking placebo (n=418, RR 0.90 CI 0.3 to 2.8). Scales that provide normally distributed data measured akathisia, dyskinesia and parkinsonism. Againthere are no clear differences between groups.</P>
<P>2.4.3 Other effects<BR/>In the doses used within these studies, olanzapine did not clearly increase nausea or vomiting, problems with sedation or agitation, hostility and withdrawal. Again, it is debatable that these should be reported as treatment emergent adverse effects. Weight was increased by six weeks in the olanzapine group but not to a statistically significant extent (2 RCTs, n=227, WMD 3.6kg CI -1.2 to 8.4) and at six months there was no clear difference in weight gain. </P>
<P>2.5 Quality of life<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1998</LINK> recorded, but did not report, usable quality of life data from <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK>, however, did present some useful information suggesting that the olanzapine group did report a higher quality of life than those allocated placebo. This did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=80, MD 8.2 CI -2.5 to 18.9). </P>
<P>2.6 Missing outcomes<BR/>Data were collected regarding inpatient or outpatient status, but again they reported no data. No study reported mortality, cognitive functioning, satisfaction with treatment, cost effectiveness, social functioning or self-harm. </P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2. OLANZAPINE versus PLACEBO (three to five days)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1999_x0028_HGDY_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1999(HGDY)</LINK> reported very short-term data and it did not seem reasonable to synthesize these with the data presented above in comparison number one as these record outcomes at about six weeks. It appears to be a switching study from a group taking clozapine to either olanzapine or placebo.</P>
<P>3.1 Global effect<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1999_x0028_HGDY_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1999(HGDY)</LINK> did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance for the outcome of change in the CGI severity scale (n=106, MD -0.23 CI -0.52 to 0.06). However, for the outcome of relapse at five days, they did find a difference in favour of olanzapine, although we are unclear what a relapse at five days means (n=106, RR 0.13 CI 0.02 to 0.96).</P>
<P>3.2 Mental state<BR/>For the outcome of change in PANSS total scores at five days, results favour olanzapine (n=106, MD -5.23 CI -9.98 to -0.48), however, on positive and negative symptoms, results were equivocal. <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1999_x0028_HGDY_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1999(HGDY)</LINK> reported improvement on change scores using the MADRS for those taking olanzapine at five days (n=106, MD -4.52 CI -6.99 to -2.05), but found no difference on the MMSE.</P>
<P>3.3 Leaving the study early. Any reason<BR/>Equivocal results for leaving the study early are reported in this very short term study (n=105, RR 0.38 CI 0.11 to 1.34).</P>
<P>3.4 Adverse events<BR/>Equivocal five day results for headache and gastrointestinal adverse events are reported.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 3. OLANZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>Twenty nine trials compared olanzapine with typical antipsychotics. Altamura 1999 (HGBQ), <LINK REF="STD-Avasthi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Avasthi 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barak 2002</LINK>, Beasley 1996a (HGAD), Beasley 1997 (E003), Bernardo 2001 (HGDD), <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhry 2003</LINK>, de Haan 2003, <LINK REF="STD-Esel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Esel 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK>, Jones 1998 (P022), <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-2003-_x0028_HGDH" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 2003 (HGDH</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>; Rosenheck 2003(HGFI), <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>(HGAJ), HGCJ (Hong Kong), <LINK REF="STD-HGCU-_x0028_Taiwan_x0029_-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HGCU (Taiwan) 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-HGFH-_x0028_Korea_x0029_-1998" TYPE="STUDY">HGFH (Korea) 1998</LINK>, used haloperidol as the comparator, while <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-He-2003" TYPE="STUDY">He 2003</LINK>, Loza 1999 (HGDT), <LINK REF="STD-HGDV-_x0028_Morocco_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">HGDV (Morocco) 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-HGCQ-_x0028_Turkey_x0029_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HGCQ (Turkey) 2000</LINK> used chlorpromazine. <LINK REF="STD-Jakovljevic1999-HGCH" TYPE="STUDY">Jakovljevic1999 HGCH</LINK> compared olanzapine with fluphenazine, <LINK REF="STD-HGBJ-_x0028_Finland_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">HGBJ (Finland)</LINK> with perphenazine and <LINK REF="STD-HGBL-1997" TYPE="STUDY">HGBL 1997</LINK>, flupentixol. <LINK REF="STD-Lima-2003-_x0028_HGHS_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2003 (HGHS)</LINK> compared olanzapine with typical antipsychotics decided upon by the clinicians involved (mainly haloperidol or chlorpromazine). </P>
<P>4.1 Death<BR/>For the outcome of death, data were reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK>) and supplied by Eli Lilly for (<LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1997-_x0028_E003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1997 (E003)</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>(HGAJ)). Death from 'all causes' was not more likely in either group (2 RCTs, n=2427, RR 1.84 CI 0.48 to 7.11). Death from suicide and accidental injury (3 RCTs, n=2609, RR 1.28 CI 0.17 to 9.70), 'other causes' (2 RCTs, n=2427, RR 1.48 CI 0.15 to 14.22) and cause 'unknown' (1 RCT, n=1996, RR 0.16 CI 0.01 to 4.04) were all equally likely whether allocated to olanzapine or the typical drug. </P>
<P>4.2 Global effect<BR/>4.2.1 No important clinical response<BR/>Data relevant to this outcome are not available for many of the studies listed above (see 'Description of studies'). At six to eight weeks, Beasley 1996a (HGAD), <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1997-_x0028_E003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1997 (E003)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> defined 'important clinical response' as those who presented at least a 40% reduction in psychotic symptoms as measured by any scale. <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, for the treatment resistant participants, defined 'important clinical response' as at least a 20% reduction in mental state ratings. The large <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> trial dominates heterogeneous results for 'any dose olanzapine', but if random effects relative risk is calculated, there is no clear difference between the typical drugs and olanzapine for this outcome (4 RCTs, n=2778, RR 0.93 CI 0.85 to 1.01, Chi square 21.8, df=3). In an earlier version of this review, we calculated the effect size using Peto Odds and a fixed effect model produced an unequivocal result favouring olanzapine (Peto OR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 7 CI 5.3 to 8.8, Chi-square 13.5, df 3). The random effects relative risk data, especially in the presence of heterogeneity and common events, are likely to be the more reliable (see 'Discussion'). Data relating to specific doses do not show differences between olanzapine and typical drugs. At 12 weeks <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-2003-_x0028_HGDH" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 2003 (HGDH</LINK>) reports equivocal data (n=263, RR 0.82 CI .64 to 1.06). At nine months <LINK REF="STD-Lima-2003-_x0028_HGHS_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2003 (HGHS)</LINK> also defined 'important clinical response' as those who presented at least a 40% reduction in psychotic symptoms on the PANSS (n=197, RR 0.85 CI 0.69 to 1.05), or a endpoint CGI score of &lt;/=2, (n=197, RR 0.82, CI 0.67 to 1.00).</P>
<P>4.2.2 Relapse/rehospitalisation<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> reported hopitalisation rates which were higher in the olanzapine arm, but the drop outs in the olanzapine arm were &gt;50% and prone to bias and data are heterogeneous (I-squared 96%).</P>
<P>4.2.3 Clinical Global Impression endpoint score<BR/>In the short term, endpoint data do favour olanzapine over typical drugs (9 RCTs, n=2503, WMD -0.31 CI -0.57o -0.06) as do three to twelve month data (5 RCTs, n=411, WMD -0.46 CI -0.83 to -0.09). </P>
<P>4.3 Mental state<BR/>4.3.1 Needing additional medication<BR/>Less people taking olanzapine required additional benzodiazepines than those taking haloperidol (3 RCTs, n=2526, RR 0.91 CI 0.85 to 0.96, NNT 17 CI 10 to 37).</P>
<P>4.3.2 Total scores<BR/>Bernardo 2001 (HGDD), <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Esel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Esel 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Loza-1999-_x0028_HGDT_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Loza 1999 (HGDT)</LINK> presented endpoint data for BPRS total scores that were equivocal between olanzapine and typical antipsychotics (6 RCTs, n=397, WMD 0.00 CI -3.38 to 3.38). Much of the skewed BPRS data, presented in 'Other data' tables, are also equivocal. PANSS total scores however, clearly favour olanzapine. Outcomes reported for the short and medium term significantly favour olanzapine (8 RCTs, n=2427, WMD -6.04 CI -11.11 to -.96; 6 RCTs n=563, WMD -8.48 CI -13.84 to -3.12 respectively). Longer-term data are again equivocal but are based on small numbers (n=44, Jones 1998 (P022)).</P>
<P>4.3.3 Negative symptoms<BR/>PANSS negative sub-score data are consistently in favour of olanzapine (short term 4 RCTs, n=2297, WMD -1.20 CI -2.37 to -0.02; medium term 5 RCTs, n=408, WMD -2.11 CI -3.34 to -0.88; long term 1 RCT, n=44 MD -4.75 CI -8.10 to -1.40). When measured using BPRS negative sub-scores and the SANS, all data still favoured olanzapine although the clinical significance of these data is not clear (see Discussion). <BR/> <BR/>4.3.4 Positive symptoms<BR/>When olanzapine was compared with typicals and rated using the BPRS positive symptom sub-score trialists found no clear difference (short term, 2 RCTs, n=110, WMD -0.97 CI -2.21 to 0.28)). PANSS positive sub-score rating in the short term was in favour of olanzapine (4 RCTs, n=2297, WMD -1.03 CI -1.63 to -0.43). In the medium term however, this was not continued (3 RCTs , n=334, WMD -2.20 CI -5.42 to 1.02 respectively). Long-term study data (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998-_x0028_P022_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998 (P022)</LINK> were not significant. Skewed data tended to favour olanzapine. </P>

All data are skewed but tend to be moderately in favour of olanzapine. They are reported in 'Other data' tables. </P>
<P>4.3.6 Subjective well being<BR/>No difference was found between the two groups in this small study (de Haan 2003).</P>
<P>4.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>4.4.1 Any reason<BR/>The results for this outcome (at four to eight weeks) vary in terms of whether they are statistically significant depending on the statistical test applied to them. The conservative random effects relative risk suggests that the difference is not statistically significant (14 RCTs, n=3344, RR 0.81 CI 0.65 to 1.02). If, however, a Peto odds ratio is employed, the results are statistically significant (14 RCTs, n=3344, OR 0.54 CI 0.46 to 0.63, NNT 8 CI 6 to 10). We suggest that the conservative approach, in this high event rate group, is more likely to be accurate (see 'Discussion'). In any event, by four/eight weeks, 34% in the olanzapine group had dropped out compared to 45% in the comparator groups. By three to 12 months, significantly fewer people had left the olanzapine group (11 RCTs, n=1084, RR 0.79 CI 0.65 to 0.95). Beyond 12 months the findings were again equivocal (n=2738, RR 0.93 CI 0.86 to1.02). At this stage 83% of those originally allocated to olanzapine had left versus 90% randomised to typical drugs.</P>
<P>4.4.2 Due to lack of efficacy<BR/>When lack of efficacy is cited as reason for attrition there is a difference at three to 12 months in favour of those taking olanzapine (6 RCTs, n=482 RR 0.57 CI 0.34 to 0.96, NNT 16 CI 11 to 167). However, there is no difference between olanzapine and other drugs up to 8 weeks and over 12 months.</P>
<P>4.5 Adverse effects<BR/>4.5.1 Anticholinergic effects - specific symptoms<BR/>Fewer people taking olanzapine experienced orthostatic changes (2 RCTs, n=82, RR 0.13 CI 0.1 to 0.4) and hypersalivation (4 RCTs, n=2636, RR 0.37 CI 0.20 to 0.71), than those on typical drugs. Other effects such as blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness and urination difficulties were equivocal.</P>
<P>4.5.2 Extrapyramidal effects<BR/>Beasley 1997 (E003), <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> report on the incidence of any extrapyramidal event. Results favour olanzapine (3 RCTs, n=2511, RR 0.41 CI 0.28 to 0.60). Heterogeneous ESRS data (Chi squared=57.25 df=2) was equivocal (4 RCTs, n=139, WMD -3.62 CI -8.11 to 0.87). Those taking olanzapine required less anticholinergic medication compared with those taking haloperidol at six to 12 weeks (4 RCTs, n=2957, RR 0.28 CI 0.21 to 0.38, NNT 3 CI 3 to 4), and by three to 12 months (n=276, RR 0.55 CI 0.35 to 0.86, NNT 8 CI 6 to 24). Data on a whole series of specific extrapyramidal symptoms favours olanzapine. Participants taking olanzapine experienced less acute dystonia, akathisia, bradykinesia, hypertonia, hypokinesia, new onset parkinsonism, rigidity, and tremor than people allocated to haloperidol. For the outcomes of dyskinetic movements and choreoathetosis data were equivocal. Interestingly, in the single study (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>) with chlorpromazine as the comparator and reporting data for this outcome, the superiority of olanzapine is less convincing. <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-2003-_x0028_HGDH" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 2003 (HGDH</LINK>) reports that fewer participants on olanzapine required propranolol. Continuous albeit skewed rating-scale data for akathisia, dyskinesia and parkinsonism all favour olanzapine but the statistical or clinical significance is unclear (see 'Discussion'). <LINK REF="STD-Bernardo-2001-_x0028_HGDD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Bernardo 2001 (HGDD)</LINK> provided skewed data for the Simpson and Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale which are not reported, due to the large SD's. <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK> reported extrapyramidal data from the DIEPSS scale; all were skewed and are shown in 'Other Data' tables. </P>
<P>4.5.3 Other adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK> reported equivocal data for adverse drug reactions which required dose reduction or additional medication. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK> for the outcome of anorexia favoured olanzapine (n=182, RR 0.26 CI 0.09 to 0.74). <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> reported that people taking olanzapine had an increase in appetite (n=1996, RR 1.65 CI 1.35 to 2.01, NNH 10 CI 7 to15). Reports of nausea were equivocal while data on vomiting favoured olanzapine over haloperidol (n=1996, RR 0.59 CI 0.45 to 0.78). </P>
<P>4.5.3.1 Drowsiness - There is no suggestion of a problem of insomnia with olanzapine. However, those taking typicals are more likely to be drowsy than those on olanzapine, (6 RCTs, n=2636, RR 0.82 CI 0.73 to 0.93, NNH 18 CI 12 to 57). Continuous data on the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire were equivocal between those on olanzapine and chlorpromazine. </P>
<P>4.5.3.2 Weight changes - This update of the review contains some new data on weight changes. Twenty of 29 studies report weight data in various ways, not all of them amenable to comparison. Data for the short term are inconclusive (8 RCTs, n=2455, WMD 0.81kg CI -0.56 to 2.18) but the three to 12 month results suggest an average gain of four kilograms (4 RCTs, n=186, WMD 4.62, CI 0.6 to 8.64). Two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Barak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barak 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-2003-_x0028_HGDH" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 2003 (HGDH</LINK>), report change data suggesting an increase in weight of 3.44 Kgs at three months (2 RCTS, n=283, WMD 3.44 CI 2.57 to 4.31). Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avasthi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Avasthi 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhry 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-2003-_x0028_HGDH" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 2003 (HGDH</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-He-2003" TYPE="STUDY">He 2003</LINK>) report heterogeneous results for weight gain (medium term) which was significantly higher for those receiving olanzapine (5 RCTs, n=428, RR 1.78 CI 1.44 to 2.19, NNH 6 CI 4 to 11), but most authors did not specify the criteria used for weight increase. One study reported this to be any weight increase &gt;= 7%. <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK> also reported on weight loss with equivocal results (p=0.06). Weight changes reported beyond 12 months were equivocal (1 RCT, Jones 1998 (P022)). </P>
<P>4.5.3.3 Other effects - One study reported treatment emergent agitation, hostility and withdrawn behaviour (Beasley 1996a (HGAD)) and found no differences between olanzapine and haloperidol. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> reported equivocal data for gastrointestinal disturbances for the olanzapine and haloperidol groups. One study, <LINK REF="STD-HGCQ-_x0028_Turkey_x0029_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HGCQ (Turkey) 2000</LINK>, reported on rash with equivocal finding for both olanzapine and chlorpromazine. <LINK REF="STD-Avasthi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Avasthi 2001</LINK> reported equivocal data for asthenia. <LINK REF="STD-Ishigooka-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ishigooka 2001</LINK> reported abnormal gait which appeared less common in the olanzapine group (n=182, RR 0.11 CI 0.3 to 0.5 NNH 6 CI 6 to 10). <LINK REF="STD-Esel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Esel 2001</LINK> reports laboratory results for prolactin levels at 6 weeks in favour of olanzapine (n=29, MD -15.01 CI -17-94 to -12.08).</P>
<P>4.6 Quality of life<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> both reported data on quality of life in a form that we could not use in this review.</P>
<P>4.7 Economic outcomes<BR/>Three studies reported cost data, however, none were in a usable form (Jones 1998 (P022), <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> and Rosenheck 2003(HGFI). </P>
<P>4.8 Missing outcomes<BR/>No data are reported for social functioning, employment status, death and family satisfaction with care. </P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 4. OLANZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC FOR THOSE WITH TREATMENT RESISTANT ILLNESS</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, compared olanzapine with chlorpromazine in hospitalised treatment resistant patients in an eight-week trial and <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> compared olanzapine with haloperidol in a 14 week trial, defining non-responders according to <LINK REF="REF-Breier-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breier 1994</LINK>; essentially those with treatment resistant illnesses. Many outcomes were not reported by Altamura 1999 (HGBQ). All participants were inpatients in <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>, however, <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> did not describe the setting of the study.</P>
<P>5.1 Global effect<BR/>5.1.1 No important clinical response<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> defined this as the number of people per group who did not present at least a 20% reduction in psychotic symptoms measured by any scale. At eight weeks thee was no difference reported between the two groups (n=84, RR 0.93 CI 0.85 to 1.01). </P>
<P>5.1.2 CGI (Clinical Global Impression)<BR/>No difference between groups was apparent in <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> (n=81, MD -0.10 CI -0.49 to 0.29).</P>
<P>5.2 Mental state <BR/>5.2.1 Total score<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> reported no discernible difference between the olanzapine and chlorpromazine groups on the total score of the BPRS (n=84, MD -2.80 CI -8.43 to 2.83).</P>
<P>5.2.2 Negative symptoms<BR/>Skewed SANS data favoured olanzapine but there were only 0.9 points difference between groups and the statistical and clinical significance were unclear.</P>
<P>5.2.3 Positive symptoms<BR/>Parametric BPRS positive sub-scale ratings favoured olanzapine but not to a degree that was statistically significant (n=84, MD -1.30 CI -2.90 to 0.30).</P>
<P>5.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>5.3.1 Any reason<BR/>No differences between those allocated olanzapine and people taking either chlorpromazine or haloperidol were apparent (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>5.3.2 Due to lack of efficacy<BR/>No difference was reported between the groups in the two trials.</P>
<P>5.4 Adverse events<BR/>Essentially the data for adverse effects reflect those already presented for the larger comparison between olanzapine and typical antipsychotic drugs for those whose illness is not treatment resistant.</P>
<P>5.4.1 Anticholinergic effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> reported fewer people on olanzapine experienced dry mouth (RR 0.52 CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNH 3 CI -6.3 to -1.8). Blurred vision, dizziness and palpitations were equivocal. Orthostatic changes (1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.13 CI 0.13 to 0.35, NNT 3CI 2 to 3) and dry mouth (1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.52 CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 3 to 7) both favoured olanzapine to chlorpromazine.</P>
<P>5.4.2 Extrapyramidal events<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> fewer people taking olanzapine experienced 'any extrapyramidal effects' (n=84, RR 0.57 CI 0.3 to1.0) or dyskinetic movements (n=84, RR 0.10 CI 0.01 to 0.5, NNH 3 CI -5.5 to -2.1). Skewed data from both the Barnes Akathisia Scale and Simpson and Angus (parkinsonism) Scale were uninformative but did not highlight clear differences between groups. </P>
<P>5.4.3 Other adverse events<BR/>Those allocated to olanzapine and chlorpromazine reported similar rates of nausea/vomiting and difficulty in getting to sleep or drowsiness. <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> (n=47) reported body weight at the end of the 14 week study. No suggestion of a difference between those randomised to olanzapine and those allocated haloperidol were seen at this time (MD 0.35kg CI -9.7 to 10.4).<BR/> <BR/>5.4.4 Missing outcomes<BR/>No data were reported on quality of life, social functioning, employment, death and harm, cognitive functioning, satisfaction with treatment and cost effectiveness. Trials supplied no clear data on the use of additional medication but <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> stated "no difference between the groups in the amount and duration of lorazepam use during the study".</P>
<P>6. COMPARISON 5. OLANZAPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>

Thirteen trials compared olanzapine with risperidone, eight with clozapine, two with amisulpiride, two with aripiprazole and one each with sonepiprazole and zisprasidone. Some of the trials relate to those with treatment resistant illness (Beuzen 1998 (HGCF), Bitter 2004 (HGCK), <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2003</LINK> and Naber 2001 (HGBF)), people in their first episode (<LINK REF="STD-Svestka-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Svestka 2003</LINK>) and the elderly (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>).</P>

By 12 months the number of people rehospitalised was significantly higher in the risperidone group (n=278, RR 0.49 CI 0.31 to 0.79, NNT 7 CI 5 to 16; <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>6.2.3 CGI endpoint score<BR/>Pooled results from three trials are equivocal (3 RCTs, n=570, WMD 0.00 CI -0.20 to 0.19).</P>
<P>6.3 Mental state<BR/>6.3.1 Needing additional benzodiazepines<BR/>Pooled data at six to eight weeks, and by eighteen weeks, shows similar numbers of participants receiving olanzapine or other atypicals (clozapine, risperidone or ziprasidone) required additional benzodiazepines. At two years, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> reports a barely significant result in favour of clozapine (n=980, RR 1.11 CI 1.01 to 1.22, NNH 16 8 to 167).</P>
<P>6.3.2 Needing an antidepressant by two years<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> reports on data from two years that more participants on olanzapine needed an antidepressant than people allocated clozapine, however, this did not reach statistical significance (n=980, RR 1.12 CI 0.99 to 1.27). The same study reported antidepressants being used as a rescue intervention to prevent suicide (n=980, RR 2.20 CI 1.21 to 4.00, NNH 26 CI 11 to 145).</P>
<P>6.3.3 No important clinical response (20 and 40% decrease in PANSS total score; 20 and 40% decrease in BPRS total score)<BR/>Short term data from four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>) were equivocal for the olanzapine and atypical groups (risperidone or clozapine). The criterion for clinical improvement was 20% to 25% or more reduction in total PANSS score. <LINK REF="STD-Svestka-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Svestka 2003</LINK> used a 50% reduction in total PANSS score over six weeks in people who were experiencing their first episode of psychosis.

BPRS data at six weeks from <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK> did not distinguish between the two groups.</P>
<P>6.3.3 Total endpoint scores<BR/>BPRS endpoint data from the clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Beuzen-1998-_x0028_HGCF_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beuzen 1998 (HGCF)</LINK> and risperidone (Tran 1997 (HGBG), <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1998-_x0028_HGBU_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1998 (HGBU)</LINK> comparisons were skewed and difficult to interpret. All findings favour olanzapine but by very minimal differences. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK> reports a statistical significance on BPRS endpoint score in favour of olanzapine (n=61, MD -1.60 CI -2.96 to -0.24). <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2002</LINK> reported equivocal BPRS end-point data for the medium term (n=377) between olanzapine and amisulpride. PANSS total scores, at three to 12 months are heterogeneous (Chi squared 37.44 df=4), and equivocal (5 RCTs, n=715, WMD 3.01 CI -5.74 to 11.76). Twelve months data are also equivocal (n=42 MD 1.86 CI -9.08 to 12.8).</P>
<P>6.3.4 Negative symptoms<BR/>No difference was seen between olanzapine and risperidone at eight weeks (n=278, MD 0.20 CI -1.1 to 1.5). Endpoint PANSS negative sub-scale scores are similar between atypicals at 3-12 months (4 RCTs, n=593, WMD -1.52 CI -2.08 to 5.13) and over 12 months (n=42, MD -0.20 CI -3.76 to 3.36). <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK> (amisulpiride) reported endpoint SANS scores as identical. Other skewed data support the parametric findings.</P>
<P>6.3.5 Positive symptoms<BR/>Both skewed BPRS and SANS data and parametric PANSS positive symptom scores do not suggest any differences between olanzapine and other atypical antipsychotics.<BR/> <BR/>6.3.6 Depression<BR/>We entered skewed data from the HAM-D (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>) and MADRS (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2002</LINK>) in 'Other data' tables, and they do not suggest any difference between those taking olanzapine, risperidone or amisulpiride.</P>
<P>6.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>6.4.1 Any reason<BR/>There was no difference in the numbers of people leaving the study early for either short, medium or long-term studies. By eight weeks, 21% of those taking olanzapine had left the study, compared to 25% taking the other atypicals. By three to 12 months, this had increased to 46% and 52% respectively.</P>
<P>6.4.2 Due to lack of efficacy<BR/>There was no notable difference between atypical drugs.</P>
<P>6.5 Adverse effects<BR/>6.5.1 Anticholinergic effects - specific symptoms<BR/>Statistically significant differences were found for the outcomes of constipation by six to eight weeks (2 RCTs, n=247, RR 0.47 CI 0.25 to 0.89, NNH 9 CI 7 to 44), 18 weeks (n=180, RR 0.35 CI 0.15 to 0.85, NNT 9 CI 7 to 36) and by two years (n=980, RR 0.45 CI 0.34 to 0.60, NNT 7 CI 6 to 10). No difference was detected for the outcome of dizziness at six to eight, or by 18 weeks, however, at two years, less people on olanzapine experienced dizziness (n=480, RR 0.51 CI 0.40 to 0.66, NNH 8 CI 6 to 11), did not report a problem with libido (n=66, RR 0.78 CI 0.61 to 0.99, NNT 5 CI 3 to 110). At all time points, those taking olanzapine experienced less salivation (6 weeks, n=121, RR 0.02 CI 0.00 to 0.36, NNT 3 CI 3 to 5; by 18 weeks, 2 RCTs, n=330, RR 0.32 CI 0.15 to 0.67, NNT 4 CI 3 to 8; by 2 years, n=980, RR 0.17 CI 0.13 to 0.23, NNT 3 CI 3 to 3) and urinary incontinence (n=980, RR 0.45 CI 0.27 to 0.77, NNT 21 CI 16 to 49) and salivation (3 RCTs, n=1192, RR 0.20 CI 0.06 to 0.63, NNT 3 CI 3 to 7). Participants taking olanzapine were more likely to experience dry mouth by two years (n=490, RR 1.51 CI 1.02 to 2.55, NNH 12 CI 7 to 715). Data for vision abnormalities at eight weeks and rhinitis were equivocal.</P>
<P>6.5.2 Extrapyramidal effects <BR/>6.5.2.1 Needing additional anticholinergic medication <BR/>At both eight to 12 weeks and three to 12 months, significantly fewer people taking olanzapine had received anticholinergic medication compared to those taking comparators, (4 RCTs, n=923, RR 0.64 CI 0.46 to 0.91, NNT 7 CI 5 to 27; 2 RCTs, n=519, RR 0.56 CI 0.4 to 0.79, NNH 9 CI 7 to 18) respectively.</P>
<P>6.5.2.2 Any extrapyramidal symptoms<BR/>Dichotomised data show no difference at eight weeks (4 RCT's, n=657, RR 0.76 CI 0.54 to 1.08), however at three to 12 months, fewer participants taking olanzapine reported any extrapyramidial symptoms (n=339, RR 0.6 CI 0.41 to 0.88, NNT 9 CI 6 to 27). </P>
<P>6.5.2.3 Parkinsonism<BR/>Skewed data from two studies using the ESRS (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, Jones 1998 (P022)), when pooled, gave equivocal results, as does <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2002</LINK> which uses the SAS.</P>
<P>6.5.2.4 Specific extrapyramidal symptoms<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Beuzen-1996-_x0028_HGCE_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beuzen 1996 (HGCE)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> reported only those adverse events that were statistically significantly different between groups, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> only reported those occurring in 10% of either group. <LINK REF="STD-Beuzen-1998-_x0028_HGCF_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beuzen 1998 (HGCF)</LINK> reported results at a 5% incidence. Rates were similar for akathisia (by three to 12 months, 4 RCTs, n=924, RR 0.98 CI 0.64 to 1.49), dyskinetic movements (2 RCTs, n=519, RR 0.99 CI 0.40 to 2.46), restlessness (n=122, RR 1.00 CI 0.15 to 6.87) and tremor (2 RCTs, n=297, RR 0.54 CI 0.15 to 1.91). Akathisia at two years however appears more prevalent in those who have taken olanzapine (n=980, RR 1.63 CI1.07 to 2.48, NNH 27 CI 12 to 239). The incidence of parkinsonism appeared less in the olanzapine group (1 RCT, n=339, RR 0.58 CI 0.36 to 0.94, NNH 11 CI 6 to 75). </P>
<P>6.5.2.3 Other adverse effects<BR/>Treatment emergent adverse events were less common in the olanzapine group (3 RCTs, n=569, RR 0.9 CI 0.82 to 0.98, NNT 13 CI 8 to 64). </P>
<P>There was no difference between those on olanzapine and those on comparators in levels of asthenia at siz to eight weeks and 18 to 52 weeks. However at two years, those taking olanzapine were less likely to have asthenia than those on clozapine (n=980, RR 0.51 CI 0.32 to 0.82, NNT 21 CI 15 to 56), or low white cell counts by two years (n=980, RR 0.44 CI 0.25 to 0.76, NNT 23 CI 17 to 53), but not at four or 18 to 26 weeks. People in the olanzapine group were also less likely to have dyspepsia at two years (n=980, RR 0.69 CI 0.50 to 0.95, NNT 22 CI 14 to 134), headache at four to eight weeks (4 RCTs, n=677, RR 0.72 CI 0.54 to 0.96, NNT 15 CI 9 to 100), hyperlactinaemia by six weeks (n= 42, RR 0.24 CI 0.10 to 0.58, NNT 2 CI 2 to 3), nausea at 18 to 26 weeks and two years (n=435, RR 0.27 CI 0.09 to 0.75, NNT 10 CI 8 to 2; n=980, RR 0.67 CI 0.49 to 0.90, NNT 17 CI 11 to 56), tachycardia at six weeks (n= 122, RR 0.06 CI 0.01 to 0.40, NNT 4 CI 4 to 6) and vomiting at two years (n= 980, RR 0.61 CI 0.45 to 0.83, NNT 15 CI 11 to 33). The longest study, Meltzer (InterSept), found no difference between groups for the outcome of diabetes mellitus at two years. Equivocal results were reported for agitation, anxiety, fever, flu syndrome, increase in SGPT, increase in transaminase, sweating, tooth disorder and postural hypotension.</P>
<P>6.5.3 Sleep problems<BR/>No statistical differences were reported in the trials between olanzapine and risperidone at six to eight weeks for insomnia or somnolence. At 18 to 26 weeks, people on olanzapine had less insommia (n=255, RR 0.34 CI 0.20 to 0.60, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8), whilst those on olanzapine at two years were more likely to suffer greater insomnia (n=980, RR 1.57 CI 1.28 to 1.93, NNH 9 CI 6 to 18). At 18 to 26 weeks, there was no difference for the outcome of somnolence, whilst at two years, people on olanzapine experienced less somnolence (n=980, RR 0.57 CI 0.48 to 0.67, NNT 5 CI 5 to 7).</P>
<P>6.5.4 Weight <BR/>Differences in weight in the short and medium term were equivocal. However, at two years, significantly more participants had gained weight on olanzapine than clozapine (1 RCT, n=980, RR 1.73 CI 1.49 to 2.00, NNH 5 CI 4 to 7). End point data reported in three trials at three to 12 months, and one study at over 12 months were equivocal. However, change data in the short term revealed an increase in weight for those taking olanzapine compared to comparator (3 RCTs, n= 463, WMD 1.42 CI 0.62 to 2.23).</P>
<P>6.5.5 Other<BR/>A single study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 2002</LINK>) reported equivocal skewed data at six weeks for the outcome of obsessive compulsive disorder.</P>

<P>6.7 Service outcomes<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2002</LINK> reported equivocal data for discharged from hospital (short term: two months). <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> reported equivocal results for an increase in levels of surveillance for those who were suicidal. Those taking olanzapine were more likely to be admitted to hospital as a rescue intervention than those on clozapine at two years (n=980, RR 1.28 CI 1.02 to 1.61, NNH 18 CI 9 to 251).</P>
<P>6.7 Missing data<BR/>No data were reported on additional medication (other than anticholinergics or benzodiazepines), social functioning, employment status, cognitive functioning and cost effectiveness. Data on satisfaction with treatment were provided by the Drug Awareness Inventory, but has yet to be included as we are still trying to identify the validity of the measure and its meaning.</P>
<P>7. COMPARISON 6. OLANZAPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS FOR PEOPLE WITH TREATMENT RESISTANT ILLNESS</P>
<P>Four trials compare olanzapine to clozapine for people whose illness were resistant to treatment (Beuzen 1998 (HGCF), Bitter 2004 (HGCK), <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2003</LINK>, Naber 2001 (HGBF).</P>

<P>7.3.3 Negative symptoms<BR/>When skewed negative sub-scores are extracted from the BPRS, no differences between olanzapine and clozapine are revealed. PANSS negative sub-scores are parametric and also show no clear differences (1 RCT, n=176, MD -0.75 CI -2.9 to 1.4).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of results<BR/>The largest trials were multi-centre and conducted primarily within the western world, although smaller studies have been reported from countries such as Morocco and Taiwan. Participants had operationally diagnosed disorders in the main uncomplicated by co-morbidity. The large <LINK REF="STD-Tollefson-1997_x0028_HGAJ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tollefson 1997(HGAJ)</LINK> study, dominant within the important olanzapine versus typical antipsychotics comparison, however, appeared more representative of day-to-day practice because those with co-morbid disorders were not excluded. More of the recently included studies come from China, Korea, and east Europe, with less originating from the USA and the UK. <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> is the longest study (two years), and uses outcomes based on more real world relevance to people with schizophrenia and clinicians alike. The inclusion criteria were more closely matched to those seen in clinical practice than in previous research trials. We welcome the inclusion of many more trials from China and are seeking further information on a number of these trials so we can include additional outcomes. Data which have been included from these trials show a marked difference in the ability of their participants to remain in the studies compared with the high attrition rates seen in the west. To summarise we get some impression of change over time with the setting, participants and outcomes of trials becoming slightly more like everyday practice.<B> <BR/>
</B>
<BR/>2. Reporting of adverse event data<BR/>Most trials only reported adverse events if their incidence was either statistically significant or had a frequency of 10% or greater which results in rare adverse effects being ignored. If this policy had been implemented rigorously in other drug trials, the agranulocytosis of clozapine and ocular problems associated with thioridazine would have gone unreported. Eli Lilly has kindly provided us with unpublished COSTART adverse event data for many of the studies and so we are able to report more adverse effect data than is seen in the final reports of the studies. It is, however still very problematic that the &gt;10% frequency rule for reporting of adverse effects is still used as a device in these influential trials.</P>
<P>3. Limited data<BR/>A great deal of global effect/mental state data are missing from the studies supplied by Eli Lilly and we have been informed that rights to these data are not available even to the company. Efforts have been made to contact authors to acquire the necessary information for inclusion in this review. It is frustrating that despite considerable investment in clinical trials, data are so limited on tolerability, social functioning, employment, death, legal problems, cognitive functioning and satisfaction. In addition, data on hospital admission, outpatient/day hospital visits seems to have been collected by several studies but only reported in a useable form in one study, <B>Beasley 1996a (HGAD).</B> We find it surprising that a compound worth in excess of $3.69bn per year (<LINK REF="REF-Sellers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellers 2003</LINK>) is so successful even though there is a lack of important data for people with schizophrenia, their families and professional carers. </P>
<P>4. The search<BR/>Researchers have studied a remarkably successful dissemination of results through academic presentations both at conferences and in journals. It is likely that even the hundreds of citations to included studies within this review represent only a proportion of presentations of these trials. Understandably the larger studies have attracted more publications or conference presentations. We have found no evidence of an attempt to conceal the fact that the hundreds of presentations relate to a limited number of studies but inclusion of the unique company trial codes in each presentation would have helped piece together the few sausages from the very thinly sliced salami. </P>
<P>Sponsorship or involvement with a pharmaceutical company was apparent in 38 of the 55 included studies (69%). Although high, this figure may be an underestimate, as in many reports, potential conflicts of interest or acknowledgements were not recorded. Sponsorship of trials by the pharmaceutical industry continues to cause concern (<LINK REF="REF-Offerhaus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offerhaus 2004</LINK>) and the continued need for independent research is advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Hoadley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoadley 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 1: OLANZAPINE versus PLACEBO<BR/>At the end of these trials the extent of those who had 'dropped out' (olanzapine 52%, placebo 53%) was of such a magnitude that all results, except for those of 'leaving the study early', are overly full of assumptions making it impossible to reach a confident interpretation. </P>
<P>5.1 Global effect<BR/>This outcome is based on only two studies. Beasley 1996a (HGAD), a study that did not extrapolate BPRS from the PANSS, gives 75% of the weighting to the final result. The fact that approximately eight people have to be treated with olanzapine, as compared with placebo, in order for one person to improve at six weeks is encouraging of olanzapines' antipsychotic properties. However, it would be more reassuring if this finding was based on more direct measures of all participants and was sustained in the long term. The CGI continuous data also favour olanzapine. Clinical interpretation of a weighted mean difference of -0.523 is, however, problematic. When analysed by dose, the effect was only seen with the 15 mg/day and 10 mg/day olanzapine groups.</P>
<P>5.2 Mental state<BR/>5.2.1 Total scores<BR/>Change in total BPRS and PANSS scores favour olanzapine over placebo. However, interpretation of an average change of seven BPRS points or 12 in the PANSS scoring is problematic, especially considering that over 50% of data are 'last-observation-carried-forward',where the trialists assume that the person remains stable after their last rating. These scales also do not produce 'interval' data (so a 20% decline from 100 to 80 is not the same clinically as a 20% decline from a score of 50 to 40). These scales dont report clinically meaningful outcomes. </P>
<P>5.2.2 Negative/positive sub-scores <BR/>The same applies to the negative and positive sub-scores as measured with the BPRS and PANSS. The SANS data, for negative symptoms, were equivocal and other information sheds doubt on olanzapine's advantage over placebo for these difficult symptoms. </P>
<P>Incomplete data from ratings of positive symptoms suggest some effect for olanzapine. It is, however, unclear how to use these data to inform those with schizophrenia or their carers.</P>
<P>5.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>There was great attrition from these studies. Over a six-week period, fewer of those given olanzapine left the study early (52%) than those given placebo (53%), NNT 14 CI 8 to 95, but the numbers are still high. Even if this result is secondary to clinical improvement, such a degree of loss must suggest that there was some factor within the design of the study that was unacceptable to participants. By one year almost everyone had left the key study in this area (Beasley 1996a (HGAD)) making any other data impossible to interpret. When lack of efficacy is cited as the reason for attrition, data are supportive of olanzapine's short term antipsychotic effects.</P>
<P>5.4 Adverse effects<BR/>Olanzapine has anticholinergic adverse effects, causing dry mouth and dizziness, but this is not significantly more apparent than placebo from analysis of the current data in this review. Specific extrapyramidal symptoms (akathisia and tremor) appeared higher in the olanzapine group, although this did not reach statistical or, probably, clinical significance. This is supported by the similar use of anticholinergic medication in the two groups. In addition all scale data relating to movement disorders showed no important differences between olanzapine and placebo. Data on nausea/vomiting and sleepiness are equivocal, but all are based on information that makes a great deal of assumptions. </P>
<P>Data supplied by Eli Lilly show that weight increases with olanzapine, even in short studies, although this did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (at six weeks WMD 3.58kg CI -1.18 to 8.34). Nearly four kilograms in six weeks would probably be of clinical significance. </P>
<P>5.5 Quality of life<BR/>It is unfortunate that <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> did not fully report quality of life data (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1998</LINK>). What limited data there are come from <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK>. The data are interesting and should encourage Eli Lilly to find more powerful data for dissemination. </P>
<P>5.6 Missing outcomes<BR/>Data were collected regarding inpatient or outpatient status, but, again, the published reports do not tell us the results. This must undermine confident use of olanzapine.</P>
<P>6. COMPARISON 2. OLANZAPINE verus PLACEBO (three to five days)</P>
<P>6.1 Global effect<BR/>It is difficult to know what to make of many of the outcomes in this very short term study on a population taking clozapine. One could surmise that this is a treatment resistant or treatment intolerant group as they were switched from clozapine to olanzapine. (Clozapine is only licensed in this group.) It would be unreasonable to be looking for major change in mental state/behaviour in those diagnosed as acutely ill.</P>
<P>6.2 Mental state<BR/>PANSS total scores at five days favours olanzapine, however, the clinical significance of a mean difference of -5.23 on this scale is unclear, and results of the positive and negative subscales were equivocal. We find the utility of the MMSE for a group of people acutely ill with schizophrenia puzzling. Depression scores favoured olanzapine.</P>
<P>6.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Unsurprisingly, few dropped out of this very short study.</P>
<P>6.4 Adverse events<BR/>Olanzapine-treated participants reported similar levels of adverse events as those taking placebo.</P>
<P>6.5 Missing outcomes<BR/>The single trial did not report on hospitalisation status or quality of life.</P>
<P>7. COMPARISON 3: OLANZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>7.1 Death<BR/>Only one study reported this important outcome. Eli Lilly supplied us with data from a further two trials. Results indicate there is no substantive difference in the numbers of people who have died due to suicide, accidental injury or other causes between olanzapine and other typical antipsychotic.</P>
<P>7.2 Global effect<BR/>From data presented in this review there are no clear differences between olanzapine and typical drugs for the outcome of 'no important clinical response at six to eight weeks'. Using odds ratios does make a statistically significant difference, but in these heterogeneous data, random effects relative risk analyses are advisable. The latter makes the result not statistically significant and this is still true at twelve weeks and nine months.</P>
<P>CGI endpoint data favours olanzapine over the typical antipsychotics both at six weeks and at three to twelve months.</P>
<P>7.3 Mental state<BR/>People taking olanzapine required less additional benzodiazepines than those taking typical drugs implying that they are less disturbed as a result of taking the olanzapine.</P>
<P>Scale derived data differs in the presented outcomes. BPRS did not favour the olanzapine group when compared with typical antipsychotics (n=397), but more powerful PANSS data do favour olanzapine. Gains are an average of a decline of six PANSS points in the short term and medium term. The clinical relevance of these scores remains unclear. Whether the PANSS is an interval scale, with a six-point decline having the same clinical meaning for someone who started with a score of 70, as for a person whose initial rating was 30, is not explained by the trials. </P>
<P>Both positive and negative symptom PANSS-derived data favours olanzapine, which underlines the impression that olanzapine is at least as effective an antipsychotic as typical drugs. Montgomery and Asberg Depression Scale data were skewed and with the data provided in the studies, clinical interpretation of these scale data is not possible.</P>
<P>7.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>People allocated to olanzapine were less likely to leave the study than those taking typical antipsychotics; the results being statistically significant or not dependent on the analysis undertaken. We suggest the most conservative random effects relative risk is more applicable (and only statistically significant at three to twelve months). At four to eight weeks 34% of those taking olanzapine and 45% of those taking a typical antipsychotic had left, and beyond 52 weeks, this had risen to 83% and 90% respectively. Such attrition makes interpretation of all the other data virtually impossible. These data suggest that clinicians should be confident that all but a few of those given olanzapine will still be taking their medication at the end of a year, provided the same study conditions apply. </P>
<P>Supporting the unclear general effects, results for the comparison of olanzapine versus typical drugs, when lack of efficacy is cited as reason for attrition there are no differences between groups except at three to 12 months where olanzapine is favoured. </P>
<P>7.5 Adverse effects<BR/>Current data pertaining to anticholinergic adverse effects, suggests that olanzapine causes less hypersalivation and orthostatic changes than typical drugs. Other effects such as dry mouth, dizziness, palpitations, constipation, dry mouth and urination difficulties were as common as they were with the older drugs.</P>
<P>Data on a series of specific extrapyramidal symptoms favours olanzapine - especially when compared to haloperidol. Within the chlorpromazine comparison the differences were less marked. Heterogeneous rating scale data do not suggest that extrapyramidal effects are less marked with olanzapine, but clinical interpretation of these heterogeneous data is not possible. We view the use of additional anticholinergic medication as a more useful marker of extrapyramidal effects (both for those taking the antipsychotics and their carers) and this is lower in those taking olanzapine than the typical drugs.</P>
<P>More people treated with olanzapine reported an increase in appetite compared to those taking conventional antipsychotics. This supports clinical experience. The data on weight gain is equivocal in the short-term studies and shows a statistically significant difference in the medium term, with those on olanzapine gaining more weight. Jones 1998 (P022), a small study, is equivocal regarding weight gain in the long-term and may be an example of a Type II Error.</P>
<P>7.6 Quality of life<BR/>It is disappointing that large and important studies, such as <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1996a-_x0028_HGAD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1996a (HGAD)</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>(HGAJ), report data on quality of life in a form that is not possible to use in this review. We hope that further collaboration with Eli Lilly will shed light on these data.</P>
<P>7.7 Economic outcomes<BR/>Statistical significance favours olanzapine for cost effectiveness, but again no usable data are provided to support this claim. </P>
<P>7.8 Cognitive function<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998-_x0028_P022_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998 (P022)</LINK> reported data on cognitive functioning that are not possible to use in this review. As this topic gains interest, it is likely that more data will be forthcoming in future studies.</P>
<P>7.9 Missing outcomes<BR/>Conclusions cannot be drawn for outcomes of social functioning or satisfaction for this popular commonly used drug.</P>
<P>8. COMPARISON 4. OLANZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS FOR PEOPLE WITH TREATMENT RESISTANT ILLNESS</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> compared olanzapine with typical antipsychotics (chlorpromazine and haloperidol respectively) in people whose illnesses were rated as treatment resistant. Olanzapine has been marketed as being structurally similar to clozapine; a drug with efficacy in treatment resistant patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wahlbeck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahlbeck 1999</LINK>). The effects of olanzapine in this sub-group of people with schizophrenia are important. Although both studies focused on treatment-resistant participants, who would, by definition, have long-standing illness, the studies were classified as short-term (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>) and medium-term Altamura 1999 (HGBQ). <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> did not describe the setting of the study.</P>
<P>8.1 Global effect<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> defined 'no important clinical response' as the number of people per group who did not present at least a 20% reduction in psychotic symptoms measured by any scale. At eight weeks there was no difference between the two groups. The continuous measure (Clinical Global Impression) corroborated this finding. It appears that olanzapine has similar global effects to typical antipsychotics on those with treatment resistant illness but this may reflect a Type II Error and these findings require replication.</P>
<P>8.2 Mental state<BR/>In keeping with the equivocal result for 'global effect', mental state measures (total BPRS, SANS, positive symptom sub-score BPRS) do not appear significantly different.</P>
<P>8.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Similar numbers of people left the studies early for 'any reason' and due to 'lack of efficacy', although rates were less than for those with non-treatment-resistant illness. This may reflect the severity of their illness, and the likelihood that they are inpatients.</P>
<P>8.4 Adverse events<BR/>Data were only available from <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> on the outcome of anticholinergic effects, where more people on chlorpromazine experienced dry mouth. It is clear, however, that olanzapine has important anticholinergic effects, as the incidence of blurred vision and dizziness was similar in both groups. More people taking chlorpromazine experienced orthostatic changes and palpitations than those on olanzapine.</P>
<P>For extrapyramidal events again data were only available from <LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK> where fewer people taking olanzapine experienced these symptoms. Until the findings of this trial are replicated, it is inadvisable to draw definitive conclusions regarding the incidence of movement disorders in relation to olanzapine. Much of the scale data were uninformative.</P>
<P>In this small study (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 1998</LINK>), olanzapine was no less sedating than chlorpromazine although the results suggested that, with larger numbers, and more power and precision, the experimental drug might have shown significantly less drowsiness than chlorpromazine. Data on weight gain were only available from the <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1999-_x0028_HGBQ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1999 (HGBQ)</LINK> medium-term study. Although when comparing baseline weights with endpoint weight, those taking olanzapine gained weight whilst those on haloperidol did not, this did not reach statistical significance. Data relating to the question of weight gain remain limited but none suggest that olanzapine causes weight to decrease. </P>
<P>8.5 Missing outcomes<BR/>No quality of life data or cost effectiveness data are reported. Conclusions cannot be drawn for the outcomes of social functioning, employment status, death and cognitive functioning or family satisfaction. </P>
<P>9. COMPARISON 5. OLANZAPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>Twenty seven studies compared olanzapine with atypical antipsychotics. These trials contained a mix of patient populations including first episode (Siesta 2003) and elderly people (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>), whereas <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> excluded people whose illness was 'treatment resistant' and <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998-_x0028_P022_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998 (P022)</LINK> studied 'stable, early phase outpatients'. Four studies included only treatment-resistant participants (Beuzen 1998 (HGCF), Bitter 2004 (HGCK), <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2003</LINK> and Naber 2001 (HGBF)) and used clozapine, a drug effective in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Wahlbeck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahlbeck 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1998-_x0028_HGBU_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1998 (HGBU)</LINK> did not expand on description further than DSM-IV criteria, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Lecrubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lecrubier 1999</LINK> described the participants as suffering from 'primarily negative symptoms'. <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2002</LINK> utilised amisulpride as the comparator antisychotic, and randomised both inpatients and outpatients. </P>
<P>9.1 Death<BR/>Again this important outcome is poorly reported. There were no significant differences in deaths reported in any study. Within well-conducted trials there are likely to be fewer deaths than amongst people with the same condition who are not part of a controlled study.</P>
<P>9.2 Global effect<BR/>At this point there are no clear differences between olanzapine and other atypicals for CGI data or clinical response. Data from a single study does suggest that rehospitalisation is lower for those given olanzapine when compared with risperidone.</P>
<P>9.3 Mental state<BR/>In the short and medium term similar proportions on olanzapine and other atypicals required additional benzodiazepines, however, by two years more people taking olanzapine required additional benzodiazepines than those on clozapine. At two years antidepressants had been used more frequently in the olanzapine treated group.</P>
<P>When mental state percentage improvements were used to classify response there was no difference between olanzapine and other atypicals. In the short term however, medium term data favoured olanzapine.</P>
<P>Endpoint data from ratings scales reveal inconsistencies with the majority of comparisons being equivocal. Olanzapine does not appear to be any different to the other atypical antipsychotics on the outcome measured by mental state rating scales. Negative symptoms were not clearly more amenable to olanzapine than other drugs of the atypical class. </P>
<P>9.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>This was a prevalent behaviour in both groups for all time periods with 49% lost in the olanzapine group and 56% in the comparator group by 12 months. Nevertheless attrition of such a degree must draw into question the external validity of all other data. Similar proportions left due to lack of efficacy of trials.</P>
<P>9.5 Adverse effects<BR/>Some anticholinergic effects appear less prevalent in the olanzapine treated group (constipation, hypersalivation) whereas dry mouth is more of a problem for those taking olanzapine.</P>
<P>Fewer people taking olanzapine received anticholinergic medication compared to those taking other atypicals. At eight weeks similar proportions in the two groups had complained of any extrapyramidal event, however, by three to 12 months this was more apparent in those taking other atypicals. New occurrences of parkinsonism were fewer in the olanzapine group. At three to 12 months akathisia was similar in the two groups, by two years it was higher in the olanzapine treated group. </P>
<P>Treatment emergent effects were less common in the olanzapine group.</P>
<P>Data reported at two years by <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> revealed lower rates of dyspepsia, asthenia, nausea, vomiting and reduction in white blood cell count in people taking olanzapine compared with those allocated to clozapine.</P>
<P>Sleep problems reveal inconsistencies with both insomnia and somnolence being side effects.</P>
<P>Weight gain appears to be more of a problem with olanzapine than other atypicals, although dichotomous data reached conventional levels of statistical significance only at two years. By eight weeks those taking olanzapine had gained significantly more weight than those taking other atypicals.</P>
<P>9.6 Quality of life<BR/>No difference is apparent between atypicals and olanzapine on two continuous measures of quality of life. It is good to see an attempt to measure this elusive but important issue. However, simple outcomes such as 'gaining employment' or 'avoiding trouble with the police' or 'feeling that life has improved in quality' may have resulted in more comprehensible information.</P>
<P>9.7 Service outcomes<BR/>Those people taking olanzapine in the <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-_x0028_InterSept_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer (InterSept)</LINK> study required significantly more admissions to hospital and increased levels of surveillance to maintain their safety compared to the clozapine group.</P>
<P>9.8 Missing data<BR/>Social function outcomes were absent as were data relating to harm, cognitive functioning and cost effectiveness. Data on satisfaction with treatment were provided by the Drug Awareness Inventory, but has yet to be included while we try to identify validity and meaning.</P>
<P>10. COMPARISON 6. OLANZAPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS FOR PEOPLE WITH TREATMENT RESISTANT ILLNESS</P>
<P>As olanzapine's structural similarity to clozapine is cited in marketing, the authors decided to incorporate a comparison with clozapine for people whose illness is treatment resistant.</P>
<P>10.1 Death<BR/>Again this important outcome was not reported. That no deaths occurred in this trial (Beuzen 1998 (HGCF)) of 180 participants is reassuring but longer-term real-world studies are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. </P>
<P>10.2 Global effect<BR/>No differences on global effect as measured by the CGI or <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1988</LINK> criteria were apparent, although this may be a Type II Error because of the small sample size. It is nevertheless interesting that there are no clear differences between olanzapine and clozapine in a treatment-resistant group of people for this outcome but more data are needed.</P>
<P>10.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>At 18 weeks (medium term) similar numbers had left the study early (46%). Olanzapine, in the context of a randomised trial, is just as acceptable or unacceptable as clozapine.</P>
<P>10.4 Adverse events<BR/>Constipation, nausea and somnolence are less of a problem for those on olanzapine compared with clozapine.</P>
<P>10.5 Missing data<BR/>Again, no data were reported relating to social functioning, quality of life or cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>11. COMPARISON 7. OLANZAPINE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS FOR PEOPLE WITH FIRST EPISODE</P>
<P>One small study of women with first episode of illness was included (<LINK REF="STD-Svestka-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Svestka 2003</LINK>) and compared olanzapine with risperidone.</P>
<P>11.1 Global effect<BR/>Equivocal data from this one small study are reported.</P>
<P>11.2 Adverse events<BR/>Fewer participants taking olanzapine required anticholinergic medication or reported any extrapyramidal adverse events.</P>
<P>Hyperprolactineamia was more common in people taking risperidone though the clinical significance of this is unclear.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>For people with less severe schizophrenia, olanzapine offers antipsychotic efficacy with fewer movement disorders. If the illness is more severe, then there is little to choose between any of the typical or atypical drugs except on the issue of adverse effects such as parkinsonism. Olanzapine is effective in reducing negative symptom scores on a mental state rating scale, but the clinical relevance of this result is unclear. These findings alone may be enough to support people with schizophrenia trying olanzapine before the typical antipsychotic drugs. Olanzapine's propensity to cause weight gain may, however, be unacceptable to many.<BR/> <BR/>2. For clinicians<BR/>The very great losses to follow up make recommendations difficult. In these trials most people given olanzapine stopped taking the drug within six months to one year. Global impression suggests that 10-15 mg/day of olanzapine is antipsychotic, being better than placebo, but, for people with severe illness, when compared with typicals and atypicals there is little difference for the same outcome. On one sub-scale score, of one mental state rating scale, olanzapine shows superiority over typical antipsychotics for negative symptoms. This result is difficult to interpret clinically. Such findings need replication in large simple studies and should not form the evidence base of treatment recommendations. Olanzapine may have fewer extrapyramidal effects than chlorpromazine and haloperidol and, perhaps, than risperidone. Despite poor data regarding the effects of olanzapine on weight, it does seem to encourage rapid weight gain. However, it is unclear as to whether this weight gain continues while the person is taking olanzapine and if the weight is lost if the drug is stopped. Currently not enough data relating to those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia are available to draw definitive conclusions. </P>
<P>3. For managers/policy makers<BR/>Olanzapine is expensive when compared with the typical antipsychotics. For people making cost-effectiveness and cost-utility decisions, there is little useful trial-derived data to help decision making.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>Clear and strict adherence to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) for all outcomes would have resulted in this review being more informative. Denominator data were not always clearly presented and some results were described as 'significant' or not, but raw data were not reported (Beasley 1996a (HGAD), <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>(HGAJ)).</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>2.1 Trial identifiers<BR/>The authors have had to inspect a very great number of presentations of the few trials included in this review and there are likely to be more that we have not yet discovered. Using specific trial identifiers, within the multiple publications, would greatly decrease confusion over identification of the source trial.</P>
<P>2.2 More studies<BR/>Additional well planned, longer, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials are needed that address important, relevant outcomes. Conflict free funding is justified. High-quality trial-derived data relating to hospital admission, satisfaction with care, family burden, employment, and important adverse effects such as weight gain are lacking. Dichotomous, clinically useful data relating to mental state and behaviour need replication and expansion. Useful cost-effectiveness data needs to be a research priority.</P>
