<TITLE>Easier access to emergency contraception to help women prevent unwanted pregnancy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-12 11:28:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent unwanted pregnancy if taken soon after unprotected sex. Getting a prescription for emergency contraception can be difficult and time-consuming. Giving emergency contraception to women in advance could ensure that women have it on hand in case they need it. We searched for studies comparing women who got emergency contraception in advance to women who got it in standard ways. We examined whether these groups had different rates of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We also studied how often and how quickly both groups used emergency contraception. Finally, we looked at whether advance provision of emergency contraception changed sexual behavior. Studies showed that the chance of pregnancy was similar regardless of whether or not women have emergency contraception on hand before unprotected sex. Women who had emergency contraception in advance were more likely to report use of the medication, and to use it sooner after sex. Having emergency contraception on hand did not change use of other kinds of contraception or change sexual behavior.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:10:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven randomized controlled trials met our criteria for inclusion, representing 7695 patients in the United States, China, India and Sweden. Advance provision did not decrease pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25 in studies for which we included twelve-month follow-up data; OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.29 in a study with seven-month follow-up data; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.20 in studies for which we included six-month follow-up data; OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74 in a study with three-month follow-up data), despite reported increased use (single use: OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.40; multiple use: OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.77 to 9.63) and faster use (weighted mean difference (WMD) -12.98 hours, 95% CI -16.66 to -9.31 hours). Advance provision did not lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.37), increased frequency of unprotected intercourse, or changes in contraceptive methods. Women who received emergency contraception in advance were equally likely to use condoms as other women.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-12 14:37:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advance provision of emergency contraception did not reduce pregnancy rates when compared to conventional provision. Results from primary analyses suggest that advance provision does not negatively impact sexual and reproductive health behaviors and outcomes. Women should have easy access to emergency contraception, because it can decrease the chance of pregnancy. However, the interventions tested thus far have not reduced overall pregnancy rates in the populations studied.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-04 04:41:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-04 04:41:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy when taken within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse. Several types of emergency contraception regimens exist, including an estrogen-progestin combination (sometimes called "combined regimen" or "Yuzpe regimen"), levonorgestrel alone, and mifepristone. An alternate method of emergency contraception is post-coital insertion of a copper-bearing intrauterine device (IUD), but this review does not cover IUDs as emergency contraceptives.</P>
<P>Effectiveness and side effects vary by regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2008</LINK>). A meta-analysis of eight studies suggested that combined regimens reduce the risk of pregnancy by about 74% when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1999</LINK>). A more recent analysis using potentially improved methodology suggested lower effectiveness rates, with the two largest studies showing rates of 47% and 53% (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2003</LINK>). Levonorgestrel regimens are more effective than combined regimens (with estimates ranging from 59-94%), with less nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Task-Force-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Task Force 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several barriers discourage widespread and timely use of emergency contraception, including limited knowledge among women and a lack of routine counseling by providers and/or willingness to prescribe the medication. In some countries, emergency contraception is available only after obtaining a prescription, which can be difficult and time-consuming, particularly on holidays or weekends when most clinics and physicians' offices are closed. Moreover, some women find it difficult or embarrassing to request emergency contraception from their physician, and others may not have a primary health care provider. Emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible, and most guidelines suggest taking the medication within 72 or 120 hours of unprotected intercourse. Even under ideal circumstances, obtaining a prescription within 72 hours can be difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2000</LINK>); to date, no studies have investigated barriers to accessing a prescription within the 120 hour time limit. Some countries sell emergency contraception over-the-counter without a prescription, and others allow women to obtain emergency contraception directly from a pharmacist without a doctor's prescription under collaborative practice agreements with physicians or state approved protocols.</P>
<P>Providing emergency contraception before it is needed in case unprotected intercourse occurs gives women rapid access to the medication. This strategy was first evaluated in a 1998 study (<LINK REF="STD-Glasier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Glasier 1998</LINK>) and has received increased attention since that time. However, some worry that having emergency contraception on hand may encourage repeat or incorrect use, increase risky sexual behavior, or discourage use of ongoing or more reliable methods of contraception (particularly barrier methods), thereby increasing the risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golden-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golden 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>During August 2006, we identified relevant trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, POPLINE, MEDLINE via PubMed, and the website of the International Consortium for Emergency Contraception (www.cecinfo.org/database/who/index.php). Where possible, searches were restricted to human studies only. We restricted our search to English (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2002</LINK>).

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-14 10:45:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies that met our inclusion criteria were independently evaluated by two reviewers. We assessed the methodological quality of each study using the guidelines described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). We designed a data abstraction form, and the two reviewers abstracted the data separately. Discrepancies about the inclusion of studies or about abstracted data were resolved by discussion. When necessary, we contacted researchers to obtain additional information about study methods or outcome measures. We entered and analyzed the data using Review Manager 5.</P>
<P>We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous variables and weighted mean averages (WMA) for continuous variables for which means and standard deviations were reported. We tested the outcome data for heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, and in cases where I<SUP>2</SUP> exceeded 50%, we employed a DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model to provide a more conservative estimate of significance (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses based on rates of loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2006</LINK>), in which studies that had rates of loss to follow-up over 20% were excluded.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>) collected 12-month follow-up information, but due to the presentation of results, we were only able to include 6-month follow-up information. In cases where data were available, we calculated statistics using an intent-to-treat analysis if the author failed to do so (<LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>, see also <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>To explore whether intervention effect waned over time, we contacted authors of studies with 12 months of follow-up to obtain pregnancy outcomes at six months, and pooled these outcomes with studies which had a total follow-up time of six months. Six-month pregnancy outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK> were not available. To explore whether pregnancy outcomes differed according to type of regimen, we performed subgroup analyses of studies using levonorgestrel, Yuzpe regimen, levonorgestrel or Yuzpe, and mifepristone.</P>

Two studies primarily enrolled post-partum women (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>). Three studies recruited women from family planning clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>), two recruited from other clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>), four recruited from hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>), and one recruited adolescent mothers receiving case management services (<LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>). The recruitment site was unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria for baseline contraceptive use varied greatly between the studies. The most restrictive criteria excluded women using or planning to use any hormonal method or an IUD (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK> excluded women for using some hormonal methods or sterilization, and <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK> excluded women for using some hormonal methods. <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK> excluded IUD users, women who had tubal sterilization or had partners who had undergone a vasectomy, lesbians, and women who had a hysterectomy. <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK> excluded women using long acting contraceptive methods (IUD, implants and injectables), and <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK> excluded only IUD and implant users. <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> excluded women who were sterilized or had a sterilized partner. Three studies had minimal exclusion criteria: <LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK> excluded only women who were determined at baseline to be pregnant, <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK> excluded women who desired a pregnancy in the next year, and <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK> did not specify exclusion criteria based on contraceptive use. Although several studies included post-partum women, only one study specified excluding women who were currently breastfeeding (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Control groups also differed considerably. Three studies did not necessarily provide any information about emergency contraception to the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>) Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>) specifically provided information about emergency contraception to the control group, but did not facilitate access to the medication in any other way. Control participants in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>) were able to obtain emergency contraception on request at the clinic, although not necessarily through study staff. One study provided the control group with a dose of emergency contraception (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>). Two studies reported providing all participants with condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK> provided condoms only to the intervention group.</P>
<P>The number of courses of emergency contraception provided in advance ranged from one to three. Seven studies provided only one course of emergency contraception in advance (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK> offered two additional courses on request at the study office, <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK> offered replacement packs through the study, and <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> provided instructions on obtaining additional emergency contraceptive pills (but did not specify if that was through the study office or by prescription). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>) provided two courses in advance and made particular effort to ensure that all women in the advance provision group had two courses available at all times. Finally, three studies provided three courses of emergency contraception in advance (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>), and one (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>) specifically noted that women using all three packs were instructed to return for contraceptive counseling and, if appropriate, given three additional packets.</P>
<P>Most trials administered levonorgestrel pills. Seven studies used the same formulation of pills (two tablets of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel) (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK> replaced a Yuzpe regimen (200 µg ethinyl estradiol and 2 mg norgestrel) with levonorgestrel when it became the standard of care mid-way through their study. Two earlier studies used a combined regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>), and one study based in China provided 10 mg mifepristone (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Follow-up ranged from three to 12 months. Six studies aimed to follow all participants for one year (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>). However, we report only on six-month follow-up data for most outcomes (except pregnancy) in <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> and all outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>, since these studies provided six-month data and six- to 12-month data, but not cumulative 12-month data. Three studies followed all participants for six months (<LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>), one study followed participants for seven months (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>) and one study followed participants for three months (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies attempted to measure pregnancy, whereas only four studies measured sexually transmitted infections (<LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>). Seven studies solely relied on self-reported pregnancy data (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>), whereas four studies used more objective pregnancy detection methods, comprised of some combination of self-report, testing at follow-up, or medical chart review (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>). Among the studies which measured sexually transmitted infections, two used self-reported data (<LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>) and two used combinations of more objective methods including testing at follow-up and medical chart review (<LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>).</P>

One study randomized in blocks of four using a table of random digits (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>). One study had participants select a colored condom from a covered bucket to determine allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>), and another used cluster randomization by date of discharge in order to avoid accidental crossover (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven studies had adequate allocation concealment methods.

Furthermore, results from the pooled analyses showed no significant difference in pregnancy rates between advance provision and control groups. The combined OR for pregnancy comparing women receiving emergency contraception in advance to women in the control group was 0.98 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.25) in studies with 12-month follow-up, 0.48 (95% CI 0.18 to 1.29) in a study with seven-month follow-up information, 0.92 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.20) in studies for which we included six-month follow-up information, and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.09 to 2.74) for one study with three-month follow-up data. Restricting this comparison in a sensitivity analysis to include only studies with a loss to follow-up rate under 20% did not substantially change the results (twelve-month follow-up: OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.31; six-month follow-up: OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37; three-month follow-up: OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74).<B> </B>None of the analyses pooled by regimen type demonstrated a reduction in pregnancy rates (levonorgestrel only: OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.05; Yuzpe only: OR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.74; levonorgestrel or Yuzpe: OR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.03; and mifepristone: OR 1.20, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.93).</P>

The combined OR for emergency contraception use for all studies was 2.47 (95% CI 1.80 to 3.40). The sensitivity analysis including only studies with a loss to follow-up rate under 20% yielded similar results (OR 2.55; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.97). A secondary analysis which used predictive modeling to estimate the baseline risk of pregnancy suggested that women at low baseline risk of pregnancy may have been more likely to use EC repeatedly than high risk women (<LINK REF="REF-Baecher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baecher 2009</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>) also showed that women in the advance provision group were significantly more likely to use emergency contraception two or more times (OR: 4.13; 95% CI 1.77 to 9.63); no sensitivity analysis was conducted for this outcome since all studies in the original analysis had loss to follow-up under 20%.</P>

In all studies reporting on non-use, non-use was lower among participants in the advance provision group compared to controls. <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK> reported use of emergency contraception among a subgroup of participants (data not reported).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK> reported non-use of emergency contraception among women who became pregnant during one year of follow-up (n=70); 79% in the advance provision group and 100% in the control group did not use emergency contraception during the cycle in which they conceived. Among women who became pregnant in <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> (n=27), 64% in the advance provision group and 100% in the control group did not use emergency contraception. Among women who became pregnant in <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK> (n=16), 71% in the advance provision group and 100% in the control group did not report using emergency contraception during the cycle in which the pregnancy occurred. <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK> reported that for the 148 menstrual cycles in which women experienced pregnancy, 77% of women in the advance provision group and 97% of women in the control group did not use emergency contraception during those cycles.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK> reported that at six-month follow-up, 26% of participants in both arms had unprotected intercourse in the past month, but 92% of women in the advance provision group and 94% in the control group did not report use of emergency contraception. In <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>, among women who reported ever having unprotected sex, 6% of women in the advance provision group and 49% of women in the control group did not report using emergency contraception during the study period. <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK> reported that half of adolescent girls reporting unprotected intercourse during the previous six months used ECP afterwards, with significantly more in intervention group using emergency contraceptive pills (58%) than in the control group (37%) (p=0.02).</P>
<P>In addition, emergency contraception was sometimes used incorrectly. <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK> reported that although all participants took the first dose within 72 hours of intercourse, 17% of women in the advance provision group took the second dose of levonorgestrel incorrectly. No women in the control group reported taking the second dose incorrectly. <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> reported incorrect use only among women who became pregnant and who reported using emergency contraception in the cycle in which they conceived (n=4). Two of these four women used emergency contraception incorrectly. <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK> reported that all women in the advance provision group took emergency contraception within the recommended 120 hours, but did not report on correct use by control participants. Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2009</LINK>) did not report on incorrect use.</P>
<P>Five studies collected information on reported time intervals between unprotected intercourse and use of emergency contraception. In general, this interval was shorter for women receiving emergency contraception in advance. Two studies provided mean time and standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>). Women with advance provision took emergency contraception a mean of 12.98 hours earlier than women with standard provision (WMD -13.98, 95% CI -16.66 to -9.31 hours). Two other studies reached similar conclusions, the first with a comparison of median times of 11.4 hours for advance provision vs. 21.8 hrs for control (p=0.005)<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>), the second with imputed median midpoints of 12 hours for advance provision vs. 36 hours for control (p&lt;0.010) (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK> also found a shorter delay for the advance provision group (p=0.008). One study suggested no difference in timing (eight hours for both groups), but this study was conducted in China, where levonorgestrel was available over-the-counter at the time of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>). A small number of women (n=2) in this study did report purchasing levonorgestrel over the counter.</P>
<P>Eight studies compared the reported frequency of unprotected intercourse using different time frames (<LINK REF="STD-Hazari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hazari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>). None showed any difference between comparison groups (unprotected intercourse in past two weeks: OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.06); unprotected intercourse in past month: OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.94); unprotected intercourse in past three months: OR 1.28 (95% CI: 0.73 to 2.24); unprotected intercourse in past six months: OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.16)).</P>
<P>Six studies examined change in contraceptive use using a variety of measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK> described this information only for a subgroup (data not reported). <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> found no differences between treatment arms in consistency of contraceptive use or type of method use during six months of follow-up, and among women who only used condoms, there was no decrease in condom use among the group with advance provision of emergency contraception. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK> reported no differences between treatment arms in patterns of contraceptive use or method change. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK> reported that use of contraception (other than emergency contraception) as reported at follow-up did not differ significantly by group. In this study, the proportion of sexually active women who did not use any form of contraception decreased slightly in both groups during follow-up. Secondary analyses of this study suggested that advance provision may have caused an increase in unprotected or underprotected sex (<LINK REF="REF-Raymond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raymond 2008</LINK>), and that advance provision may have caused women to substitute EC for other methods (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2009</LINK>), but these findings should be considered hypothesis-generating and do not influence our overall conclusions.</P>
<P>Eight studies looked at condom use; none found significant differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2008</LINK>). The OR for condom use at 12 months was 1.01 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.16); at six months: OR 0.94 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.34), at three months: OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.25), in last month: OR 1.54 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.53), and at last sex: OR 1.18 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.94).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-01 10:47:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advance provision of emergency contraception did not reduce unplanned pregnancies when compared to standard access. None of the adequately powered trials found a decrease in pregnancy rates with advance provision of emergency contraception (<LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>). Pooled estimates also showed no difference in pregnancy rates, indicating that based on available data, advance provision of emergency contraception does not lead to reduced rates of unintended pregnancy. Analyses by length of follow-up and by type of regimen did not change results.</P>
<P>This conclusion conflicts with earlier optimistic projections of the potential public health impact of improved access (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1992</LINK>). Emergency contraception is more effective than placebo in preventing unwanted pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Raymond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raymond 2004</LINK>), and advance provision increases use and shortens time between unprotected intercourse and emergency contraceptive use. Since evidence now supports ia single dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg, and several countries now market levonorgestrel emergency contraception in a single dose, incorrect use will likely be less of a problem in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Arowojolu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arowojolu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Hertzen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Hertzen 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, women may not perceive themselves to be at risk of pregnancy and may fail to use the method after unprotected sex has occurred, despite ready availability. Research suggests that unperceived pregnancy risk, concerns about side effects, and inconvenience are some of the reasons why women may not use emergency contraception when needed (<LINK REF="REF-Sorensen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorensen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moreau-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreau 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rocca-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rocca 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goulard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulard 2006</LINK>). A secondary analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK> suggested that women at the lowest baseline risk of pregnancy may have been more likely to use EC repeatedly than high risk women, which may help to explain why no effect on pregnancy was found (<LINK REF="REF-Baecher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baecher 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>As with other contraceptive methods, the disparity between theoretical and actual effectiveness can be large (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 1996</LINK>). More precise estimates of efficacy may help to shed light on advance provision's lack of impact on unintended pregnancy.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>These trials share a common weakness. Reported information on use of emergency contraception, frequency of unprotected intercourse, and changes in contraceptive patterns was of unknown validity. Since these self reports lacked objective verification, this information should be viewed with caution (<LINK REF="REF-Stuart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 2009</LINK>). Objective evidence indicates that self reports on use of contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaluso-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaluso 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galvao-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galvao 2005</LINK>) and other medications (<LINK REF="REF-Landry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landry 2006</LINK>) are inaccurate, and that self-report of unprotected intercourse is inferior to other ascertainment methods (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2005</LINK>). Some degree of underreporting of pregnancies may have occurred in both the advance provision and control groups in these trials, particularly those trials using only self-reported data. Induced abortions are routinely underreported (<LINK REF="REF-Fu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fu 1998</LINK>). However, results from the trials relying on pregnancy testing were consistent with results from the trials using self-reports of pregnancy.</P>
<P>Advance provision of emergency contraception consistently increased its reported use and usually shortened the reported interval between unprotected intercourse and drug administration. However, changes in these measures did not correlate with changes in pregnancy rates.</P>
<P>The quality of these randomized controlled trials varied widely. While many had good methods of randomization and allocation concealment, follow-up rates differed greatly. One trial planned not to follow most participants after randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2006</LINK>), so we excluded it. In the view of Sackett and others, when losses exceed 20% of participants randomized, the credibility of a trial is suspect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2006</LINK>). Trials with high losses to follow-up resemble cohort studies in their potential for bias. For the sake of completeness, we included trials with poor follow-up and performed a sensitivity analysis with and without these reports; the results were similar.</P>

<P>Providing women with emergency contraception in advance of need does not reduce unintended pregnancy on a population level. Advance provision did not have any harmful effects in primary analyses: it did not increase rates of sexually transmitted infections, decrease condom use, encourage adoption of less reliable contraceptive methods, or otherwise negatively impact sexual and reproductive behavior. While derivative studies suggested theoretical concerns regarding increases in unprotected or underprotected sex, or potential substitution of EC for more effective methods, these findings should be considered tentative. Advance provision did increase use of emergency contraception and decrease the length of time between unprotected intercourse and use of emergency contraception. Conclusions about population level effects should not impede efforts to ensure all women have access to emergency contraception when they need it. Women should be given information about and easy access to emergency contraception because individual women can decrease their chances of pregnancy by using the method. However, current data on advance provision of emergency contraception indicate that tested interventions will not reduce overall unintended pregnancy rates. <B>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-07-03 08:42:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>I have a slight concern about one of the sentences in the final paragraph of the "Background" section of this review, which reads: "Economic modeling indicates that advance provision of emergency contraception is a cost-effective public health strategy".</P>
<P>Look at the referenced paper, I don't think the situation is nearly as clear cut as this sentence suggests. The model appears to rely on the assumption that advanced supply reduces pregnancies, while the review itself finds no evidence for this assumption. The reference paper also includes the sentence "At the population level, advanced provision of ECPs has not been demonstrated to be cost effective."</P>
<P>I think the sentence as printed in the review doesn't reflect the uncertainty here, particularly since the review itself undermines the economic model on which the statement that EC is cost-effective relies. I think that it would be more accurate to say that the cost-effectiveness is uncertain.</P>
<P>Many thanks,<BR/>Simon Howard</P>

<P>I agree with Simon Howard's critique. I think the confusion stems from the fact that the reference cited is a living document (http://<A HREF="http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/EC-review.pdf">ec.princeton.edu/questions/EC-review.pdf</A>) and thus the conclusions of the reference paper may have been modified over time.<BR/>
<BR/>I would be happy to simply delete that sentence from our review. </P>
