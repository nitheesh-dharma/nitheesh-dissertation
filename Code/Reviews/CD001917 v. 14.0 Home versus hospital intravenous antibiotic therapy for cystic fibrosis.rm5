<TITLE>Intravenous antibiotics given at home for people with cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-08 20:15:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving antibiotics at home to people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease linked to recurrent lung infections. As a result of these infections, the person's lung disease becomes progressively worse. Lung infections are often treated with intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) in hospital for a number of weeks. This is costly and disrupts the life of people with cystic fibrosis. Treatment can be given at home if patients and their carers are given enough training and support. We looked for randomised controlled trials which compared intravenous antibiotic treatment in hospital with treatment at home. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 23 November 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found one study with 17 people aged 10 to 41 years who had a flare up of infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. The people taking part were assigned to either home antibiotics or hospital antibiotics at random. Those who had home antibiotics initially spent up to four days in hospital and were taught to prepare and administer their own intravenous antibiotics. They were discharged with enough medication and equipment for the course of treatment and were visited at home. All participants received the same type of antibiotic and the course lasted at least 10 days.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There were no differences found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, or complications linked to intravenous treatment. People at home were more tired and found the treatment more difficult to master. This may be due to them being more active and needing more support. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. There were no details about indirect costs. We conclude that treatment at home does not harm people in the short term and does reduce social disruption. However, the decision in favour of this option must be made on an individual basis. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is very limited and more research is strongly needed to recommend its use.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-26 12:02:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Recurrent endobronchial infection in cystic fibrosis requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics for several weeks usually in hospital, affecting health costs and quality of life for patients and their families. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-11-26 11:11:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 23 November 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-02-14 09:31:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies of intravenous antibiotic treatment for adults and children with cystic fibrosis at home compared to in hospital.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-22 10:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The authors independently selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed methodological quality of each study and extracted data using a standardised form.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 12:50:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Eighteen studies were identified by the searches. Only one study could be included which reported results from 17 participants aged 10 to 41 years with an infective exacerbation of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. All their 31 admissions (18 hospital and 13 at home after two to four days of hospital treatment) were analysed as independent events. Outcomes were measured at 0, 10 and 21 days after initiation of treatment. Home participants underwent fewer investigations than hospital participants (P &lt; 0.002) and general activity was higher in the home group. No significant differences were found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, complications or change of intravenous lines,or time to next admission. Home participants received less low-dose home maintenance antibiotic.</P>
<P>Quality of life measures showed no significant differences for dyspnoea and emotional state, but fatigue and mastery were worse for home participants, possibly due to a higher general activity and need of support. Personal, family, sleeping and eating disruptions were less important for home than hospital admissions.</P>
<P>Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. Indirect costs were not determined.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-04-22 10:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Current evidence is restricted to a single randomized clinical trial. It suggests that, in the short term, home therapy does not harm individuals, entails fewer investigations, reduces social disruptions and can be cost-effective. There were both advantages and disadvantages in terms of quality of life. The decision to attempt home treatment should be based on the individual situation and appropriate local resources. More research is urgently required.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-26 12:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-26 12:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:40:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder in Caucasians (<LINK REF="REF-Kosorok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosorok 1996</LINK>). It is characterised by recurrent endobronchial infection leading to progressive pulmonary deterioration. The colonisation of the airways occurs, mainly with <I>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</I> and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2007</LINK>). The presence of methicillin-resistant <I>S. aureus</I> (MRSA) has been associated with increased mortality in patients with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Dasenbrook-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dasenbrook 2010</LINK>), but other organisms such as <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</I> have been implicated in risk of severe respiratory infections and worsening of lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2011</LINK>).  </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-17 12:57:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Traditional management of those pulmonary exacerbations includes aggressive airway clearance, and antibiotics administered intravenously for several weeks usually as an inpatient (<LINK REF="REF-David-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1986</LINK>). As the lung disease progresses, patients may require more frequent hospitalizations which greatly increases healthcare costs and adversely affects the individual's quality of life.</P>
<P>Home intravenous (IV) therapy with antibiotics is usually commenced for exacerbations of pulmonary disease. Therapy can begin in hospital or as an outpatient and requires the training of individuals and their carers alongside suitable medical support.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-14 09:33:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Home IV therapy in CF is a response to both increasing demand for hospital beds, and the need for treatment to interfere as little as possible with the individual's normal lifestyle and quality of life. Home IV therapy may also cut costs by avoiding hospital admission or reducing length of stay. Staying in hospital may be hazardous for people with CF because of the risk of contracting <I>Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia)</I>, MRSA, and other multiresistant organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-26 12:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Although, in certain countries most healthcare centers have established protocols for home IV treatment, few of them audit the outcome of their home IV antibiotic service (<LINK REF="REF-Gilchrist-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilchrist 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A paper by Sequeiros identified 16 studies (mainly observational) that compared home IV antibiotic treatment for acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF against conventional hospital IV treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sequeiros-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sequeiros 2009</LINK>). Some studies showed a similar outcome for home IV therapy and hospital IV therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gir_x00f3_n-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Girón 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proesmans-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proesmans 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strandvik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strandvik 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Laag-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Laag 1995</LINK>), while other studies showed an inferior outcome for home management (<LINK REF="STD-Bosworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bosworth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donati-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Donati 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Esmond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nazer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nazer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wolter 1997</LINK>). However, most studies were retrospective or inadequately powered to provide clear answers. The obvious question is whether patients who were treated in hospital had more severe lung disease than those treated at home.</P>
<P>Collaco retrospectively studied 1,535 patients with CF recruited between 2000 and 2007 in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Collaco-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collaco 2010</LINK>). This study showed no differences in short and long-term lung function, regardless of whether IV therapy is administered in inpatient or in outpatient settings. Lung function measurements obtained during therapy suggest that longer courses of IV antibiotics (14 to 21 days) may not confer additional improvement in lung function over shorter courses (8 to 10 days).  Once again, limitations of this study prevent the drawing of more firm conclusions. </P>
<P>It is not known if people receiving home IV antibiotic therapy have better or equivalent health outcomes compared with people receiving inpatient care; whether the provision of home IV therapy results in a reduction in costs to the health service (<LINK REF="STD-Bosworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bosworth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donati-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Donati 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pond-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pond 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rucker-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rucker 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strandvik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strandvik 1992</LINK>); or whether people prefer this form of treatment.</P>
<P>This is an update of previously published reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Asensio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asensio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The included study was carried out in two hospitals in Brisbane (Australia) (<LINK REF="STD-Wolter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wolter 1997</LINK>). This study provides data from a total of 17 adolescents and adults with CF, with a respiratory infective exacerbation by <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. No definition criteria are provided for the diagnosis of CF. A respiratory exacerbation was defined as an increase in dyspnoea with or without increased sputum production, fever or a drop in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>). All participants had colonisation of their sputum with <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. Those with unstable disease, dwelling outside the city, a history of non-compliance, or an inability to learn treatment techniques were excluded. Participants were randomized in blocks of four, by sealed envelope, to home or hospital therapy. After initial randomization, those with recurrent episodes received alternated treatment arms. The antibiotic therapy for both arms was ceftazidime 2 g every 12 hours and tobramycin 4 to 6 mg/kg daily as a single bolus for a minimum of 10 days. All participants received physiotherapy twice daily, plus 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. Participants assigned to home therapy spent two to four days in hospital before discharge and were taught how to prepare and administer their own IV antibiotics. Assessment days were: admission (Day 0), Day 10 of therapy and 10 days after cessation of IV therapy and treatment (Rx).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-14 09:54:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This review is based only on one study including 17 participants and some important methodological limitations were identified. Assessment was not blinded but seven out of nine outcome measures were assessed by objective instruments. Two important outcome measures were not used: the culture of sputum to assess remission of lung infection; and improvement of clinical scores. Some participants in the hospital arm did not complete a 10-day course of treatment. All these factors make it difficult to draw any conclusions for practice from this review. Only adults and adolescents were included, so the results cannot be extrapolated to children. The study did not address whether the participants or their families preferred home or hospital treatment.</P>
<P>In the light of the available evidence, home therapy does not seem to harm individuals in the short term since clinical outcomes gave similar results at all time points used. In the short term, home IV therapy is less expensive, particularly when compared to hospital admission and treatment. Quality of life measures are especially important in this context. The results of this review suggest that quality of life seems to be better when the treatment is administered at home. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution, as assessment of dyspnoea, fatigue, emotion and mastery gave worse results for home treatment. Two factors may have contributed to this: fatigue, which could possibly be due to a higher general activity (housework and social duties); and feelings of lower level of control over the disease and its consequences. On the other hand, no validated instruments were used for family, social, sleep and eating disruptions which may have given beneficial results for home therapy.</P>
<P>The importance of four elements of the treatment has been highlighted for pulmonary exacerbations: adherence to regular IV antibiotics; intensive physiotherapy; increased intake of nutrients; and adequate rest (<LINK REF="REF-Sequeiros-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sequeiros 2009</LINK>). Until further studies provide more conclusive answers, the assessment of home IV treatment requires the consideration of the patients' characteristics. For example, patients with co-morbidities or patients with more severe exacerbations, may be too fatigued or present too much distress to adhere to the therapies adequately.  Patients may experience glucose intolerance during an exacerbation; patients with CF-related diabetes usually require increased doses of insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>). Nutritional needs, elevated in most patients with CF, are even greater during an exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2000</LINK>). Patients with renal dysfunction are of special concern for potential further renal deterioration and may required close drug monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Flume-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flume 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, more studies are needed with better designs, including more participants, longer follow-up periods (one year and more) and a broad range of outcome measures. Due to the relatively small number of people with CF, well-conducted multicenter studies may shed more light on the current evidence. Cross-over designs might not be the best approach since assessment of long-term results, such as prognosis and survival is difficult.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:48:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:48:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The current evidence is too limited to draw conclusions for practice. The limited evidence available is from participants who commenced treatment in hospital and suggests that, in the short term, home therapy is associated with less social disruption and no serious adverse events. The decision to commence home therapy should be based on the individual and be co-ordinated from units with appropriate outpatient resources. Patients should be informed of the different possible outcomes regarding home-based IV treatment in comparison to hospital-based IV treatment, in order to let them choose accordingly.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is strongly required, ideally a multicenter, properly designed RCT including a sufficient number of participants to increase statistical power and allow assessments of outcomes in the long term.</P>
