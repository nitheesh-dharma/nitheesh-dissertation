Some fluids consist of a simple salt solution in the same salt concentration as cells and blood, such as isotonic saline; others are buffered solutions that resist changes in pH when small quantities of an acid or a base are added to them. Buffered fluids include additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, so they are matched more closely to fluid in the blood.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We searched the literature up to June 2016 and found 19 studies, with a total of 1096 adults randomly assigned to receive buffered or non-buffered fluids. Some included trials involved minor surgery in otherwise fit and healthy patients. Other trials analysed outcomes after major surgery in high-risk patients, and five trials included patients undergoing renal transplant surgery. We reran the search in May 2017 and decided that we will deal with one new study of interest when we update the review.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Overall results show that the number of deaths was low and provide no evidence that choice of fluids - buffered or non-buffered - influenced the number of deaths that occurred around the time of surgery in the three trials that looked at this outcome (involving 267 participants). We found no differences between groups in the numbers of participants whose kidney function was adversely affected. Analysis of clinical outcomes suggests that buffered fluids are an equally safe and effective alternative to non-buffered fluids for adult patients undergoing surgery. The pH of the blood after surgery was reduced among patients receiving saline (pH 7.32 vs 7.38), suggesting that buffered fluids are associated with less metabolic acidosis. The saline group had higher serum chloride and sodium levels than the buffered fluid group. This might be expected, as members of the saline group were receiving saline and no other electrolytes. Higher serum chloride is a cause of metabolic acidosis.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>We assessed the quality of evidence as generally moderate, although quality of evidence showing effects of fluid choice on kidney function was low because of the presence of other factors that could affect kidney function in these participants. Evidence shows wide variation in the types of surgery performed and in drivers for and volumes of fluid administered across trials. Reported outcomes varied a great deal between included trials, and some results were expressed in ways that did not allow their inclusion in our findings.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:31:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:31:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Perioperative fluid strategies influence clinical outcomes following major surgery. Many intravenous fluid preparations are based on simple solutions, such as normal saline, that feature an electrolyte composition that differs from that of physiological plasma. Buffered fluids have a theoretical advantage of containing a substrate that acts to maintain the body&#8217;s acid-base status - typically a bicarbonate or a bicarbonate precursor such as maleate, gluconate, lactate, or acetate. Buffered fluids also provide additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, more closely matching the electrolyte balance of plasma. The putative benefits of buffered fluids have been compared with those of non-buffered fluids in the context of clinical studies conducted during the perioperative period. This review was published in 2012, and was updated in 2017.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To review effects of perioperative intravenous administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance, or both, on clinical outcomes in adults undergoing all types of surgery.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We electronically searched the Clinicaltrials.gov major trials registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2016). We handsearched conference abstracts and, when possible, contacted leaders in the field. We reran the search in May 2017. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of &#8216;Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate this trial into formal review findings when we prepare the review update.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Only randomized controlled trials that compared buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for surgical patients were eligible for inclusion.

We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus, in collaboration with a third review author. We contacted trial authors to request additional information when appropriate. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (ORs) and for continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data via Review Manager 5.3 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I &gt; 40%), we used random-effects models.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review includes, in total, 19 publications of 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1096 participants. We incorporated five of those 19 studies (330 participants) after the June 2016 update. Outcome measures in the included studies were thematically similar, covering perioperative electrolyte status, renal function, and acid-base status; however, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. We identified variable protocols for fluid administration and total volumes of fluid administered to patients intraoperatively. Trial authors variably reported outcome data at disparate time points and with heterogeneous patient groups. Consequently, many outcome measures are reported in small group sizes, reducing overall confidence in effect size, despite relatively low inherent bias in the included studies. Several studies reported orphan outcome measures. We did not include in the results of this review one large, ongoing study of saline versus Ringer's solution. </P><P>We found insufficient evidence on effects of fluid therapies on mortality and postoperative organ dysfunction (defined as renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy); confidence intervals were wide and included both clinically relevant benefit and harm: mortality (Peto OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.33; I = 0%; 3 trials, 6 deaths, 276 participants; low-quality evidence); renal insufficiency (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I = 0%; 4 trials, 22 events, 276 participants; low-quality evidence).</P><P>We noted several metabolic differences, including a difference in postoperative pH measured at end of surgery of 0.05 units - lower in the non-buffered fluid group (12 studies with a total of 720 participants; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.07; I = 61%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. We observed a higher postoperative serum chloride level immediately after operation, with use of non-buffered fluids reported in 10 studies with a total of 530 participants (MD 6.77 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38 to 10.17), and this difference persisted until day one postoperatively (five studies with a total of 258 participants; MD 8.48 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.88). We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Current evidence is insufficient to show effects of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid fluids on mortality and organ system function in adult patients following surgery. Benefits of buffered fluid were measurable in biochemical terms, particularly a significant reduction in postoperative hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Small effect sizes for biochemical outcomes and lack of correlated clinical follow-up data mean that robust conclusions on major morbidity and mortality associated with buffered versus non-buffered perioperative fluid choices are still lacking. Larger studies are needed to assess these relevant clinical outcomes.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:41:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Administration of intravenous fluids is a nearly universal practice for patients undergoing major surgery who need to maintain intravascular volume at a time when that volume may be depleted owing to preoperative dehydration, intraoperative haemorrhage, or movement of fluid into a different physiological space. Intravenous fluids in these circumstances offer the advantages of being relatively cheap and easily available and causing few side effects as compared with blood transfusion. The ideal intravenous fluid would allow splinting of the circulation for an adequate time to replace missing plasma volume whilst not leading to adverse effects.</P><P>Intravenous fluids are manufactured with the addition of a mixture of electrolytes to water (making a crystalloid solution), and sometimes with the addition of a suspension of particles to water (making a colloid solution). A wide variety of available fluid formulations differ in two basic ways: first, by the different component electrolytes that are in solution with water, which can interact with the body's internal equilibrium once infused; and second, by the addition of a suspended non-soluble colloid material to exert oncotic pressure. The colloid versus crystalloid debate has been extensively explored, but the electrolyte formulation itself has been less often examined (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2001</LINK>). In 2011, a series of guidelines on administration of intravenous fluids were released (<LINK REF="REF-GIFTASUP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GIFTASUP 2011</LINK>). One key recommendation was that balanced solutions should be used for fluid resuscitation and replacement to avoid metabolic derangement. A recent consensus statement from the International Fluid Optimization Group also recommended the use of balanced crystalloids for low-risk patients undergoing surgery of short duration (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2015</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Different intravenous solutions have been available for human use for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Cosnett-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosnett 1989</LINK>). For the past half-century, the most widely used fluids have been based on a 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline). Similarly, most colloids have been available only suspended in normal saline. This reliance on normal saline has been due in large part to its ease of manufacture and its ability to counteract effects of fluid loss - capabilities that have been shown historically. Thus, saline-based fluids have remained the standard of care when intravenous volume is required but administration of blood or blood products is not needed. </P><P>The electrolyte composition of normal saline is significantly different from that of plasma given to replace it. This may cause electrolyte imbalance, in particular, hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Prough-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prough 1996</LINK>), as plasma is diluted with saline. An electrolyte imbalance such as this alters the body's internal milieu and has a wide range of effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellum-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellum 2004</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Intravenous fluid formulations that closely match the constituents of human plasma have been available for some years (<LINK REF="REF-Hartmann-1934" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann 1934</LINK>). In particular, these fluids contain a physiological buffer that helps to maintain the body's acid-base balance. Other notable differences in the composition of these buffered fluids include variable quantities of other electrolytes, such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which closely reflect the composition of plasma. Several types of crystalloid and colloid solutions contain this physiological buffer (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Over the past few years, researchers have investigated and compared the effects of buffered and non-buffered fluids by conducting in vitro (<LINK REF="STD-Roche-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roche 2006</LINK>), animal (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcox-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcox 1983</LINK>), and healthy volunteer studies (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1999</LINK>).</P><P>We planned to perform several subgroup analyses to identify patients for whom optimal selection of fluids may be important. Planned analyses involved (1) examining the effects of different colloid fluid types among elderly versus younger patients on the basis that younger patients may have greater physiological reserve; and (2) assessing the ability of the body to compensate for effects of different fluids among patients undergoing elective versus emergency procedures on the basis that patients treated in an emergency situation may have less capacity to deal with non-buffered fluids, and among patients undergoing cardiac versus non-cardiac surgery on the basis that cardiopulmonary bypass may have profound effects on acid-base and electrolyte status.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Over the past decade, several published clinical trials have examined outcomes of surgery among adult patients, but these trials differed in outcomes measured, case mix included, size of study samples enrolled, and quality of evidence provided.

We graded the quality of this evidence as moderate. Analysis of all secondary outcomes measured by 18 different randomized controlled trials of 1096 participants suggests that intravenous fluids containing a physiological buffer are a safe alternative to saline-based fluids for adult patients undergoing surgery. Data show no differences between groups in terms of renal dysfunction or surrogate markers of renal dysfunction (urine output and serum creatinine). We rated this evidence as low quality. Results for some of the other secondary outcomes revealed differences between groups, including reduced postoperative pH (pH 7.32 vs 7.38, with mean difference (MD) 0.05 lower in the non-buffered group (95% CI -0.04 to -0.07)), which suggests that buffered fluids given perioperatively are associated with a lesser degree of metabolic acidosis. We rated this evidence as moderate quality. Four trials with a total of 267 participants provided evidence on renal insufficiency leading to the requirement for renal replacement therapy suggesting that risk of renal insufficiency requiring renal support is lowered by the use of buffered fluids (4.7% (11/148) vs 9.2% (11/119)), but we have little confidence that this difference is real (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I = 0%). We downgraded the quality of this evidence to low because of limitations in the design of three studies that included participants with the confounding effect of pre-existing organ failure (i.e. participants undergoing renal transplant for renal failure) (<LINK REF="STD-Hadimioglu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hadimioglu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2005</LINK>).</P><P>Data show higher postoperative serum chloride levels in the non-buffered group than in the buffered group (chloride 114.3 mmol/L vs 107.5 mmol/L, for MD of 6.7 with 95% CI -10.17 to -3.38). We rated the quality of this evidence as moderate. Higher chloride concentrations in these fluids might suggest this outcome. Higher serum chloride is a cause of metabolic acidosis and may explain our findings of both lower pH and lower partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>) (secondary to respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis) when non-buffered fluids were used (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1978</LINK>).</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This systematic review includes published trials comparing buffered and non-buffered fluid administration during major elective surgery in adults only. Such fluids are used in a variety of clinical contexts including trauma resuscitation, burns, and sepsis, and are given to paediatric patients. Our review did not assess trials conducted outside the adult perioperative setting, hence we cannot draw conclusions beyond those applicable to elective surgery in adults.</P><P>Whilst these trials reported many outcomes, very few addressed our primary outcome of death or major organ system failure - most studies reported metabolic or symptomatic differences between groups of patients. Therefore, the numbers reported for our primary outcome are low, and our analyses may not have detected differences between patient groups for these outcomes.</P><P>Trials within our review included a total of 1096 participants. We cannot rule out rare adverse effects of buffered or non-buffered fluid administration for adult surgical patients, but we can conclude that both fluids appear equally safe. Some evidence indicates that selection of buffered or non-buffered fluids may have measurable effects on the composition of plasma in surgical patients. None of these effects were primary outcomes, and none has been shown to directly affect patient outcomes. However, these metabolic differences may have clinically significant effects that were not detected by our study. Meta-analysis of high versus low chloride content of fluid administered to surgical and critical care patients has indicated a weak but significant association with risk of acute kidney injury among surgical and critical care patients (<LINK REF="REF-Krajewski-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krajewski 2015</LINK>). Likewise, a systematic review of near-isotonic or isotonic crystalloids found evidence to support varying acid&#8211;base status and other physiological outcomes between even relatively similar fluid types (<LINK REF="REF-Orbegozo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orbegozo 2014</LINK>). Results of our review are compatible with the conclusion that different crystalloid fluids have different profiles of effects on acid&#8211;base status and plasma electrolyte concentration. However, current available evidence is insufficient to clearly resolve the question of whether such differences have clinical applicability by beneficially altering prognosis for postoperative patients.</P><P>Given the lack of evidence on harm and putative benefit for biochemical status, recent guidelines related to perioperative fluid management have begun to recommend use of balanced salt solutions, such as Hartmann&#8217;s, in routine clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-GIFTASUP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GIFTASUP 2011</LINK>). However, different countries, and indeed different clinicians, continue to report conflicting views and practices. The phenomenon of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis and its relationship to saline-based fluid administration are well understood among perioperative physicians, and many favour a buffered fluid preparation. Clinicians who work with other acutely unwell patient groups may still not be aware of this phenomenon.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>A total of 19 publications reported results from 18 randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 1096 participants. We judged the evidence from these trials to be of moderate to low quality by using GRADEproGDT software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEproGDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEproGDT 2015</LINK>). Data for several outcomes show considerable heterogeneity between study populations. Differences in the characteristics of patients undergoing surgery ranged from American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II status in patients who were relatively well, to ASA III or greater status among those with end-stage organ failure. Such a broad range of patients would suggest a similarly broad range of expected outcomes, and thus reduced generalizability of observed outcomes to the surgical population as a whole. For example, the observation that choice of fluid may be associated with differences in the numbers of patients with end-stage renal insufficiency who progress to postoperative organ failure may be true of that specific population of patients but may not be true for a population with normal renal function. Therefore, one must exercise caution when interpreting these results. For this reason, we downgraded the quality of evidence for this specific outcome by two levels to low. Similarly, trials show major differences in the types of surgery under investigation. Some included trials examined very minor surgery in otherwise fit and healthy patients (<LINK REF="STD-Chin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 2006</LINK>). Others analysed outcomes after major surgery in high-risk patient groups (<LINK REF="STD-Waters-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkes 2001</LINK>), and some focused only on renal transplant surgery. This clinical heterogeneity among surgical procedures exacerbates the difficulty encountered in interpreting trial results and in ascertaining their applicability to the general population.</P><P>Most included trials were of high methodological quality (see <A HREF="http://03/">Figure 3</A>), although some did not specify blinding methods used and one was explicitly unblinded. <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> illustrates that few studies demonstrated high risk of bias. This same figure reveals that many studies had unclear risk of bias. It remains unclear to the authors of this review whether these findings were simply a result of poor reporting of methods, or were reflective of poor trial design.</P><P>Data for some outcomes were highly skewed. Whilst we analysed these data using the most appropriate method that we could identify, one must regard review conclusions with caution. For example, patients receiving non-buffered fluids were given an increased volume of platelets compared with those in the buffered fluid group. These data were highly skewed (standard deviation divided by the mean was &lt; 1). Confidence intervals for this pooled effect were large for logged data, indicating that the pooled estimate is not very precise. More data are required to determine whether differences between groups in the quantity of platelets transfused are indeed important.</P><P>We also found differences in various estimates of coagulation function, such as end of surgery levels of von Willebrand factor and Factor VIII. Two studies reported these outcomes upon comparing buffered colloids versus non-buffered colloids (<LINK REF="STD-Gan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulla-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kulla 2008</LINK>). These results should be interpreted with caution, as we analysed only two studies with few participants.</P><P>This review identified small numbers of patients and low numbers of events across outcomes of interest, including the primary outcome of mortality. Awareness of this, along with unclear risk of bias, perhaps reflective of poor reporting, should lead us to interpret review results with caution. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical implications of our findings.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We took measures to reduce bias throughout this systematic review process, and we adhered to guidance provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

This led to us report many outcomes based on small patient groups at different time points. Many studies included co-interventions that were not ubiquitous across all studies. For example, some studies administered different types of fluids such as colloids and blood alongside trial fluids. In addition, heterogeneity within some analyses was pronounced (this is particularly true of <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>), and this may have weakened the robustness of review results.</P><P>Some trial data did not contribute to our analyses because they were reported in weight-based units rather than in absolute amounts.

Our systematic review identified moderate-quality evidence to support the safety of buffered fluids in terms of their low risk of precipitating electrolyte disturbance. In particular, evidence in our review shows that perioperative buffered fluid resuscitation is associated with hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis in a reduced proportion of patients when compared with non-buffered fluid resuscitation. Some patients, including those with hypernatraemic acidaemia, are at increased risk of postoperative metabolic derangement. Buffered fluids are appropriate for fluid replacement during surgery and should be considered especially for patients with, or at risk of, metabolic derangement.<BR/><BR/>However, our review has not presented evidence to support a difference in our primary outcome (i.e. mortality) between buffered and non-buffered fluids. Likewise, although buffered fluids are demonstrably safe when compared with non-buffered fluids, the ultimate choice regarding administration of fluid to meet individual patient requirements remains at the discretion of the clinician.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>These data were derived from studies of variable quality and remain underpowered to detect any morbidity or mortality arising from selection of buffered or non-buffered fluids for administration during the perioperative period. One of the key limitations of these studies, which has consequences for the generalizability of the findings of this review, was the heterogeneity of protocols for fluid administration, including wide variation in volumes of fluid administered across studies and in targets used to drive fluid administration. Additional studies are needed, including specifically a large, adequately powered and appropriately blinded randomized controlled trial of sufficient power to detect differences in clinical outcomes arising from the physician's choice of fluid.</P><P>Future trials should seek to identify trends in meaningful patient-centred outcomes such as mortality, quality of recovery, length of hospital stay, and organ dysfunction, and in quality of life measures such as postoperative pain. One large study of saline versus Ringer's lactate that assessed major postoperative complications as its primary outcome measure is currently ongoing and is expected to be completed in 2022.</P><P>Our review examined effects of buffered and non-buffered fluids on adult surgical patients. Several other patient groups, for example, surgical and medically unstable paediatric patients and critically ill adult patients in the intensive care unit, also are treated with large volumes of intravenous fluid. Clinical trials are comparing use of buffered and non-buffered fluids in these patient populations. A systematic review of these data may reveal findings consistent with the findings presented in our review.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-09-12 15:35:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We thank the following for statistical advice.</P><P>Tony Brady, Statistician/Data Manager, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Council.</P><P>Rafael Perera, Statistician, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK.</P><P>We would like to thank Bita Mesgarpour and Sorahi Bampoe for extracting data from <LINK REF="STD-Nuraei-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nuraei 2010</LINK>.</P><P>We would like to thank Mike Bennett (Content Editor); Nathan Pace (Statistical Editor); and Daniel Chappell and Giovanni FM Strippoli (Peer Reviewers) for help and editorial advice provided during preparation of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Burdett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burdett 2012</LINK>).</P><P>We would like to thank Michael Bennett (Content Editor); Jing Xie (Statistical Editor); Janne Vendt (Information Specialist); and Janet Wale (Consumer Editor) for help and editorial advice provided during preparation of this updated systematic review.</P><P>We thank Karen Hovhannisyan (former Trials Search Co-ordinator, Cochrane Anaesthesia, Critical and Emergency Care Review Group (ACE)) for help with search strategies.</P><P>Finally, we thank Jane Cracknell (Managing Editor, ACE) for her advice, support, and patience.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2017-09-13 10:25:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>For this updated review, new review authors (SB and PO) performed searches, extracted data, analysed data, and prepared the manuscript.
