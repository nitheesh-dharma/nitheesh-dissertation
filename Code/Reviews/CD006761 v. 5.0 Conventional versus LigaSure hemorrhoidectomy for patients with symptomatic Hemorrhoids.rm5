<P>Hemorrhoidectomy is a frequently performed surgical procedure. The excisional technique is regarded to be the first choice for grade III and IV or recurrent hemorrhoids. As conventional hemorrhoidectomy is associated with postprocedural pain, modifications have been proposed to diminish this complication. An example is the use of the Ligasure as coagulation between the forceps only with high frequency currency and active feedback control over the power output has minimal thermal spread and limited tissue charring. This could result in a decreased incidence of postoperative pain.</P>

<P>To compare patient tolerance focussing on pain following Ligasure and conventional hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A multi-database (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL) systematic search was conducted. Key journals were handsearched. There was no restriction on language.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing hemorroidectomy using the Ligasure-technique with conventional diathermy techniques for symptomatic hemorrhoids in adult patients were included.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-09 22:48:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies together with a third party. Odd Ratios were generated for dichotomous variables.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-09 22:47:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve studies with 1142 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pain score at the first day following surgery was significantly less in the Ligasure group (10 studies, 835 patients, WMD -2.07 CI -2.77 to -1.38). Most outcomes concerning analgesics used (7 studies) and pain scores up to 7 days (5 studies) favoured the Ligasure-technique. The benefit was diminished at day 14 (VAS pain score, 4 studies, 183 patients, WMD -0.12 CI -0.37 to 0.12). The conventional technique took significantly longer to complete (11 trials, 9.15 minutes, CI 3.21 to 15.09). There was no relevant difference in postoperative complications, symptoms of recurrent bleeding or incontinence at final follow-up. Hospital stay was similar for both groups (6 reports, 525 patients, WMD -0.19 CI -0.63 to 0.24). Patients treated with the Ligasure-technique returned to work significantly earlier (4 studies, 451 patients, 4.88 days, CI 2.18 to 7.59). Sensitivity analysis on high quality studies, fixed effects models, open or closed conventional techniques revealed no clinical relevant different results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-20 16:13:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the usage of the Ligasure technique results in significantly less immediate postoperative pain after hemoroidectomy without any adverse effect on postoperative complications, convalescence and incontinence-rate, this technique is superior in terms of patient tolerance. Although there was a tendency for equal efficacy, more evaluation of the long-term risk of recurrent hemorrhoidal disease is required.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-25 13:53:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-25 13:50:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A considerable part of the adult population is affected by hemorrhoids. When this benign anorectal disorder becomes symptomatic, investigation should follow to rule out other diagnoses. Based on the combination of complaints and the results of clinical examination, hemorrhoidal disease can be classified into four stages. They range from first-degree bleeding to fourth-degree protruding hemorrhoids that can not be reduced. Along goes the treatment from medical therapy to operative intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2004</LINK>). This review focussed on the hemorrhoids requiring surgical intervention. Two commonly used excisional procedures are the open Milligan-Morgan (<LINK REF="REF-Milligan-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milligan 1937</LINK>) and the closed Ferguson (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1971</LINK>) technique. In most trials comparing both techniques, similar results have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2004</LINK>). Although hemorrhoidectomy is currently regarded as the most effective therapy, it is associated with significantly more complications and pain than nonoperative treatment (<LINK REF="REF-MacRea-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacRea 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jayaraman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayaraman 2006</LINK>). To minimize the postoperative discomfort following conventional surgery, several alternatives to the conventional techniques have been developed such as for instance a circular stapling device. A beneficial effect on postoperative pain has been reported by several autors using this technique but in a cochrane review it was associated with a higher long-term risk of recurrent hemorrhoidal disease and the appearance of rectal prolapses (<LINK REF="REF-Jayaraman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayaraman 2006</LINK>). Therefore, the authors concluded that at present the conventional excisional technique remains the standard treatment. The excision can be performed with a cold scalpel, diathermy, scissors, laser, ultrasonically activated scalpel or a bipolar electrothermal sealing device. The use of scissors or laser compared to diathermy provided no significant benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandini-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandini 2006</LINK>). Conflicting results have been reported concerning the use of an ultrasonically activated scalpel (Ultracission TM) making it impossible to draw definitive conclusions in this respect (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2004</LINK>). A bipolar electrothermal sealing device or Ligasure-TM (Valleylab, Boulder, CO) was introduced in the field of hemorrhoidectomy. In contrast to diathermy or electrocautery, this device uses a very high frequency current providing hemostasis by denaturating collagen and elastin from the vessel wall and surrounding connective tissue. It is postulated that sealing of hemorroidal tissue in between the Ligasure-forceps is achieved with minimal collateral thermal spread and limited tissue charring through use of active feedback control over the power output and could result in diminished post procedural pain as compared to conventional surgical techniques. The validity of this hypothesis is the subject of the present review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review evaluated the results of randomized trials comparing conventional to Ligasure assisted hemorrhoidectomy. The primary goal was to ascertain whether the use of Ligasure results into less postprocedural pain.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-09-09 21:49:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain measured with a visual analog scale or verbal numeric scale at the first postoperative day as well as the amount and number of patients using analgesics were the primary outcome measures addressed in this review. The operative variables, complications, incontinence and patient related outcome were considered as secondary outcome measures. Operative variables were operating time in minutes and blood loss in mililitres. Complications were postoperative bleeding, urinary retention, constipation, incomplete wound healing, anal fissure, anal stenosis and late minor bleeding. Late minor bleeding was regarded as recurrent disease. Incontinence was defined as any grade of incontinence at follow-up. Patient related outcomes were length of hospital stay, return to work and satisfaction.</P>

<P>The following electronic databases were searched in the same manner: Medline, EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINAHL. There was no restriction on language. Principal authors were contacted if possible for further information related to the study and any other studies published and unpublished. All reference lists were searched for additional studies. Hand-searches were performed on the following journals from 2000 and beyond: Annals of Surgery, British Journal of Surgery and Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. This search was conducted completely in 2008. An updated search in March 2011 encompassed the electronic databases only, and did not reveal any new trials to be included in this version.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-04-01 15:56:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The identified trials were screened by two independent authors (SWN and IDH). Full text of the eligible studies were obtained and each reviewer independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Excluded studies were documented and the reasons for exclusion stated. Any difference in opinion was arbitrated by a third-party (JDZ). The methodological quality of all studies eligible for the review was assessed independently. Each included trial was scrutinized for the following criteria: concealed randomization, technique of randomization, number of randomized patients, number of patients not randomized with explanation, exclusion of randomization, blinding of observer, blinding of outcome assessment, similarity between treatment and control group at entry, representativeness of patients, prospective data collection, documentation of dropouts, follow-up, standardization of outcome assessment, and whether the intention-to-treat analysis was employed. Two investigators independently extracted the results of each trial on a standard data sheet. The data were cross-checked. Where possible missing data was sought from the authors. The quality of included studied was assessed by using the modified Jadad score (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>), considering a score of four and more as high quality.</P>
<P>For statistical analysis RevMan Analysis software in Review Manager 5.1.1 was used. Odd Ratios were generated for dichotomous variables. Weight Mean Differences type IV were used for analysing continuous variables. Both were presented with a 95% confidence interval. If studies reported medians instead of means, the difference of medians was assumed to be equal to the difference of means. If no measure of dispersion was given, these data were tried to be obtained from the authors or retrieved out of the confidence interval or range. Where there were sufficient data, a summary statistic for each outcome was calculated. If data were insufficient for statistical analysis, observational results were presented. Where appropriate, a formal meta-analysis was conducted with investigation of heterogeneity. Standard random effects model were used as the data resulted from surgical interventions from different centres. In case of considerable heterogeneity (test of inconsistency &gt; 50%) a sensitivity analysis was performed for high quality studies (MJS&gt;3), conventional open and closed techniques. These analyses were performed for six clinically relevant parameters: pain score at day 1, postoperative bleeding, urinary retention, anal stenosis, incontinence and hospital stay.</P>

In total 1142 patients were evaluated. Two reports provided additional information as they were follow-up studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawes 2003</LINK>). The characteristics of these trials are provided. Follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 37 months. The majority of the papers described patients with grade III or IV hemorrhoids. Two papers did not specify the grade of hermorrhoids and used the definition of symptomatic prolapsed hemorrhoidal disease requiring hemorrhoidectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Milito-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Milito 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palazzo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palazzo 2002</LINK>). Further selection criteria as well the Ligasure-technique were defined well in most cases. Five studies applied the closed (Ferguson, Loder and Phillips and Fansler) technique as conventional (<LINK REF="STD-Altomare-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Altomare 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franklin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Franklin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pattana_x002d_arun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pattana-arun 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>), the remaining applied the open Milligan-Morgan technique. In all method sections the use of diathermy was noted, only in the study of Pattana-arun the excision was by Metzenbaum scissors and bleeding stopped by electrocauterization (<LINK REF="STD-Pattana_x002d_arun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pattana-arun 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most trials assessed several different clinical outcomes with postoperative pain being the most common. Most used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in centimetres (zero, no pain to ten, worst possible pain). Palazzo et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Palazzo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palazzo 2002</LINK>) computed a median daily score out of VAS scores of 7 consecutive days. Pattana-Arun et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Pattana_x002d_arun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pattana-arun 2006</LINK>) used the Verbal Numeric Scale. Follow-up was fully completed in most primary reports. In the trial of Muzi, reasons were provided and total follow-up was 250 out of 284 patients (88%) (<LINK REF="STD-Muzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muzi 2007</LINK>). Two of the included trials were subsequently re-published under different authors with long-term follow up of the original patients in the trial. The original publication by Jayne et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Jayne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jayne 2002</LINK>) was updated with long-term data by Peters in 2005 for 30 of 40 patients (75 per cent)(<LINK REF="STD-Peters-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2005</LINK>). Similarly, the original data published by Palazzo et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Palazzo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Palazzo 2002</LINK>) was updated by Lawes in 2004 for 30 out of 34 patients (88%) (<LINK REF="STD-Lawes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawes 2003</LINK>). </P>

<P>The randomization assignment ranged from inadequate (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorbeck-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thorbeck 2002</LINK>) to adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Altomare-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Altomare 2008</LINK>) whereas the sealed envelopes were not described opaque in any study. In most trials follow-up was carried out by interview or postal questionnaire. In the study of Jayne et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Jayne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jayne 2002</LINK>) a blinded surgeon assessed discharge and follow-up was performed by blinded nurse practioners. An independent observer was used in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Milito-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Milito 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muzi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). In the trial conducted by Palazzo (Palazzo) patients were kept unaware of what procedure had been performed until the consignment of the research data two weeks postoperatively. Most studies scored four points on the Modified Jadad Score (MJS). Extremes were 1 point (<LINK REF="STD-Thorbeck-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thorbeck 2002</LINK>) and 5 points (<LINK REF="STD-Muzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muzi 2007</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>The Ligasure technique was performed in significantly less time (11 trials, 9.15 minutes, CI 3.21 to 15.09). Intraoperative blood loss was more with the conventional technique (2 studies, 124 patients, WMD -22.33, CI -26.46 to -18.20).</P>
<P>
<B>Complications</B>
<BR/>Postoperative bleeding did not differ significantly between the techniques (11 studies, 1108 patients, OR 0.55, CI 0.24 to 1.27). There were non-significant trends of less urinary retention, constipation, anal fissure and stenosis following the Ligasure procedure. A trend for delayed wound healing was seen in the conventional technique group, which was significant after 3 and 6 weeks (both 1 study) for wound dehiscence in days (2 studies). Late minor bleeding was reported for 6 versus 8 patients (6 studies, 765 patients, OR 0.72, CI 0.10 to 5.24. Symptoms of incontinence at final follow-up was non significantly different (8 reports, 896 patients, OR 0.69 CI 0.18 to 2.61).</P>
<P>
<B>Patient related outcome</B>
<BR/>Hospital stay was similar for both groups (results of 525 patients in 6 reports, WMD -0.19 CI -0.63 to 0.24). Patients treated with Ligasure returned to work significantly earlier (4 studies, 451 patients, WMD 4.9 days, CI 2.18 to 7.59). There was a non-significant trend of more patients being unsatisfied with the results in the conventional group (2 studies, 70 patients, OR 0.53 CI 0.16 to 1.70).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>For the results of pain at day 1 and 7, procedure time, wound dehiscence, hospital stay and return to work there was significant statistical heterogeneity. In other results it was not significant or not applicable at all. For the six predefined parameters, analysis of the high-quality studies showed similar results with a reduction in estimated effect and heterogeneity. The use of fixed effects model had hardly any effect on the results. Analysis of the subgroup with open hemorrhoidectomy revealed an increase in the heterogeneity for incontinence, and analysis of the subgroup with the closed technique showed a chance to non significance in statistical heterogeneity for hospital stay.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-25 13:53:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain following hemorrhoidectomy is a well known complication. Its aetiology is however less obvious. General factor such as patients' characteristics and anesthetic influences may play a role. As for the surgical components, the tissue damage and subsuquent inflammatory response cause nociception. An example of tissue damage is the thermal spread of diathermy used with hemorrhoidectomy. Avoiding or minimizing extended thermal injury might translate into decreased postoperative pain. It has been postulated that such minimal thermal injury can be achieved with the use of a bipolar electrothermal sealing device (Ligasure-TM, Valleylab, Boulder, CO). In contrast to diathermy or electrocautery, this device uses a very high frequency current providing hemostasis by denaturating collagen and elastin from the vessel wall and surrounding connective tissue. The Ligasure has the potential to reduce thermal damage through use of active feedback control over the power output. Furthermore the head of the device is heat-sink engineered to ensure a cool (below 45 degrees Celsius) surface. Histological studies and in situ thermal imaging has shown negligible evidence of thermal damage (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2003</LINK>). For this reason the Ligasure-technique has been used in hemorrhoidectomy. Reviewing the randomized controlled trials on this subject, this technique was related to less postoperative pain in comparison to conventional surgical techniques.</P>
<P>There are however some comments to be made on study size and design, pain assessment, different conventional techniques and other devices. Some trials included in this review had a relatively small number of patients. Follow-up was sufficient for assessment of direct postoperative pain, however for long-term outcome such as incontinence and complications, it was only sufficient in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lawes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Muzi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2005</LINK>). Data on possible explanatory factors such as preoperative pain or co-existing pain syndromes were not provided. Age, degree of hemorrhoids, duration of complaints, employment and the number of piles excised could influence the pain experience. These parameters weren't included in the meta analysis. In the majority of studies reporting these results however, there were no significant differences found. Exceptions are significantly more hemorrhoids treated with Ligasure in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pattana_x002d_arun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pattana-arun 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2008</LINK>). The primary outcome of the visual analogue pain score at 1 day was only a one-dimensional pain measurement. Pain disabilities or influences on quality of life were rarely assessed. In future studies on this subject a more comprehensive pain assessment could provide valuable additional information.</P>
<P>Another drawback are the different techniques used. The Milligan-Morgan technique was applied in the majority, the closed technique was used with different alternatives. In the American Gastroenterological Association Technical Review on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Hemorrhoids four trials randomzing between open and closed technique were review (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2004</LINK>). In three no difference in pain was found, one reported less pain following the open technique. In another RCT on this subject less pain was reported after the closed technique (<LINK REF="REF-You-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2005</LINK>). Based on these results, both open and closed techniques were initially considered to be equal in terms of postoperative pain in this review. The sort of technique was included in the sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Pain was the primary endpoint. The significant reduction after Ligasure at day 1 was 2.07 points on a 10-point-scale. This result was with a statistical significant heterogeneity. Pains scores in the first week as well as the amount of analgesics used was measured too infrequently to reach consistency or significance. All results showed however a trend for less pain following the Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy. Although this benefit seemed to be reduced two weeks after the procedure, the diminished direct postoperative pain is correlated with a lower risk for persisting postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Kehlet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehlet 2006</LINK>). Secondary endpoints were operative variables, complications and convalesence. Although the differences in operating time and blood loss were significant, the tests for heterogeneity were significant and 9 minutes and 22 mililiters reduction may be regarded clincally irrelevant. The lower incidence of complications favoured the Ligasure, however, most results were not significant different. The conventional technique was associated with longer hospital stay and patient's dissatisfaction. The difference in days to return to work, which favoured the Ligasure technique, was significant.</P>
<P>The heterogeneity was assessed. As the test for heterogeneity was significant for some results, a sensitivity analysis was performed on 6 predefined parameters. These parameters were regarded as clinicaly relevant: pain at day 1, postoperative bleeding, urinary retention, anal stenosis, symptoms of incontinence and hospital stay. The analysis of high quality studies (Modified Jadad Score &gt; 3) showed a reduction in the significant difference and the extent of heterogeneity. For symptoms of incontinence at follow-up there was an increase in difference favouring the ligasure technique. However the extent of heteogeneity increased as well (I<SUP>2</SUP> from 5 to 44%). Subanalysis of the resuls after open and closed technique sowed similar results. The analysis of the other complications were mostly without significant hetereogeneity. In all subanalysis the parameter hospital stay was with a high I<SUP>2</SUP> value. It is probably related to the different hospital's discharge policies.</P>
<P>The decrease in thermal spread is not unique to the Ligasure device. It can also be provided by sealing with ultrasonic coagulating shears. In two studies there was no difference in thermal spread between these two devices (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harold-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harold 2003</LINK>). An ultrasonic device (Harmonic Scalple-TM) has been used in hemorrhoidectomy and is compared to the Ligasure in one randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kwok-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kwok 2005</LINK>). The use of an ultrasonic device was associated with more postoperative pain inhere.</P>
<P>The results for patients tolerance favoured the Ligasure technique. Initially, comparable well tolerance was reported for another device, the stapling device. However, due to a high long-term risk of recurrent hemorrhoidal disease and prolaps found in a review, the ethousiasm has been diminished. In the present review, effort was made to analyse long-term results. Only six trials included late minor bleeding as an endpoint. The definition for minor bleeding varied between the studies; from late bleeding to hemorrhoidal symptoms. Half the trials reported no recurrences. Altomare et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Altomare-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Altomare 2008</LINK>) reported 5 versus 2 bleedings and 2 versus 1 redo-surgery within 30 days for the Ligasure and conventional group respectively. The remaining two studies had a follow-up of 3 years. Their combined results were 1 versus 6 recurrences in favour of the Ligasure technique. Based on the results of 8 trials, the symptoms of incontinence at final follow-up did not differ significantly. These results established the efficacy of the Ligasure only partly. Therefore, more evaluation of the long-term risk of recurrent hemorrhoidal disease is required</P>
<P>Since the publication of the protocol of this review another meta-analysis has been published on this subject (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2007</LINK>). The authors found similar results as most of their included studies were the same. They included the results of the study of Chung et al.(<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2002</LINK>), wherein another than Ligasure bipolar scissor technique was used. As the latest search of the present review was performed two years later, another four randomized trials were added. The evidence for at least the short-term outcomes seemed to be growing. The additional costs for the device might be limited when general socio-economical aspects the benefits are taken into account. With still only three reports with a reasonable follow-up, long-term incontinence and recurrence rates could change the evident clinical preference for Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy in terms of patient tolerance.</P>
