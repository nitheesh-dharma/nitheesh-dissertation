<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>No trials with clinically-important outcomes were identified. Many of the studies were conducted in convenience samples of patients. Many of the trials were methodologically flawed. Adverse events were rarely reported. Decrease in serum potassium was the most frequently reported outcome: for this outcome beta agonists and intravenous insulin-and-glucose were effective. The combination may be more effective than either alone. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-29 21:31:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperkalaemia occurs in outpatients and in between 1% and 10% of hospitalised patients. When severe, consequences include arrhythmia and death.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review randomised evidence informing the emergency (i.e. acute, rather than chronic) management of hyperkalaemia</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (issue 4, 2003), and SciSearch using the text words hyperkal* or hyperpotass* (* indicates truncation). We also searched selected journals and abstracts of meetings. The reference lists of recent review articles, textbooks, and relevant papers were reviewed for additional potentially relevant titles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All selection was performed in duplicate. Articles were considered relevant if they were randomised, quasi-randomised or cross-over randomised studies of pharmacological or other interventions to treat non-neonatal humans with hyperkalaemia, reporting on clinically-important outcomes, or serum potassium levels within the first six hours of administration.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All data extraction was performed in duplicate. We extracted quality information, and details of the patient population, intervention, baseline and follow-up potassium values. We extracted information about arrhythmias, mortality and adverse effects. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed using random effects models.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-29 21:31:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the studies of clinically-relevant hyperkalaemia reported mortality or cardiac arrhythmias. Reports focused on serum potassium levels. Many studies were small, and not all intervention groups had sufficient data for meta-analysis to be performed. On the basis of small studies, inhaled beta-agonists, nebulised beta-agonists, and intravenous (IV) insulin-and-glucose were all effective, and the combination of nebulised beta agonists with IV insulin-and-glucose was more effective than either alone. Dialysis is effective. Results were equivocal for IV bicarbonate. K-absorbing resin was not effective by four hours, and longer follow up data on this intervention were not available from RCTs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Nebulised or inhaled salbutamol, or IV insulin-and-glucose are the first-line therapies for the management of emergency hyperkalaemia that are best supported by the evidence. Their combination may be more effective than either alone, and should be considered when hyperkalaemia is severe. When arrhythmias are present, a wealth of anecdotal and animal data suggests that IV calcium is effective in treating arrhythmia. Further studies of the optimal use of combination treatments and of the adverse effects of treatments are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-29 21:32:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperkalaemia is defined as an excess concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular fluid compartment. Hyperkalaemia occurs in outpatients, and between 1% and 10% of hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paice-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paice 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shemer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shemer 1983</LINK>), often due to renal failure, hyperglycaemia, or inappropriate use of potassium supplements and other drugs that affect potassium homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Acker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paice-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paice 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shemer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shemer 1983</LINK>). Commonly used therapies include intravenous (IV) calcium salts to reverse membrane polarization abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1998</LINK>); bicarbonate (<LINK REF="REF-Halperin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 1998</LINK>), insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Zierler-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zierler 1987</LINK>) or beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1985</LINK>) to shift potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment; and resins (<LINK REF="REF-Berlyne-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlyne 1966</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Frohnert-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frohnert 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1976</LINK>
<LINK REF="REF-Scherr-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherr 1961</LINK>) or dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 1988</LINK>) to remove potassium from the extracellular compartment.</P>
<P>Patients with hyperkalaemia may experience weakness, fatigue, distal paraesthesiae, and respiratory depression (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1993</LINK>). Changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) include peaked T waves, QRS widening, and diminished P waves (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 1981</LINK>). Severe hyperkalaemia can cause the QRS complex to merge with the T wave, leading to a sine wave pattern. This may progress to atrioventricular dissociation, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and death.<BR/>
<BR/>Treatment for hyperkalaemia has been shown to vary from patient to patient within an institution, without obvious rationale (<LINK REF="REF-Acker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acker 1998</LINK>). Variations in recommendations for treatment of hyperkalaemia were observed in a survey of nephrology program directors (<LINK REF="REF-Iqbal-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iqbal 1989</LINK>). No previous systematic review of this question has appeared.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<UL>
<LI>To summarise randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of acute interventions (calcium, insulin, beta-2 agonists, bicarbonate, ion-exchange resins and dialysis) in the treatment of patients with hyperkalaemia, with respect to the outcomes: serum potassium, ECG changes, arrhythmia, adverse effects of therapy and death.</LI>
<LI>To identify whether the addition of beta-2 agonists to IV insulin is safe (few adverse effects) and effective (results in greater lowering of serum potassium than IV insulin alone).</LI>
<LI>To identify whether the addition of IV insulin to beta-2 agonists is safe (few adverse effects) and effective (results in greater lowering of serum potassium than beta-2 agonists alone).</LI>
<LI>To identify whether the addition of sodium bicarbonate to other agents of combinations is safe (few adverse effects) and effective (results in greater lowering of serum potassium than other agents or combinations alone).</LI>
<LI>To identify areas in which further investigation is required.</LI>

<P>We searched the following databases:</P>
<UL>
<LI>MEDLINE(1966-2003),</LI>
<LI>EMBASE (1980-2003),</LI>
<LI>
<I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 4, 2003)</LI>

<LI>SciSearch.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Articles were identified through the keyword search: hyperkal* OR hyperpotass*. In MEDLINE, the strategy was refined by combination (Boolean 'and') with an expert search strategy that has been shown to identify studies of therapeutic interventions with 98% sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1994</LINK>). We searched the journals <I>American College of Physicians Journal Club</I> and <I>Evidence Based Medicine</I> using the text words potassium, hyperkalemia/c and hyperkalaemia/c. Abstracts from the American Society of Nephrology meeting between 1996 and 2003 were searched using the same text words. We reviewed the reference lists of chapters describing the management of hyperkalemia in the following textbooks: Brenner and Rector's The Kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 2000</LINK>), the Oxford Textbook of Nephrology (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 1998</LINK>), Schrier's Diseases of the Kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Schrier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrier 1993</LINK>), and the online reference UpToDate. We also reviewed the reference lists of recent review articles on hyperkalaemia and all relevant studies. Studies were not excluded on the basis of language of publication.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-29 16:17:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thedatabase searching, identification of relevant articles, quality assessment and data extraction was performed independently in duplicate by two reviewers (BAM and WADS; DL and KT). Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently in duplicate and full text obtained for possibly relevant articles. Final decisions were made independently by the two reviewers on the basis of full text. Disagreements were resolved by group discussion including CMC, and consensus was reached in each case. Where data is available in text or tabulated form, this was extracted in preference to values displayed graphically. Where relevant outcomes (e.g. serum potassium) were reported only graphically, data were extracted from photographically enlarged copies of graphs. With the exception of data extracted from graphs, differences were resolved by consensus. For data extracted from graphs, the mean values of those obtained by each of the two reviewers were used, unless one set was clearly in error on comparison. Correspondence with study authors was attempted to complete missing data. Studies were not excluded on the basis of author, affiliation, language, journal or publication year. Final decisions to include or exclude based upon an examination of the full text of each identified article, along with additional information from authors who responded to questions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical assessment</HEADING>
<P>Random effects models were used to combine outcomes for interventions versus placebo and for comparisons between interventions. If available, change in serum potassium from baseline to serum potassium 30 (± 5) minutes and 60 (± 5) minutes after the intervention were to be combined. Dichotomous outcomes (arrhythmia, death) were to be presented for the total follow-up period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We had prespecified a subgroup analysis summarising RCTs only (and excluding quasi-RCTs), however, no quasi-RCTs were identified. We had also planned to examine, if data permitted, whether effects were different in convenience samples (e.g. haemodialysis patients studied before a routine treatment), compared with patients requiring clinical treatment for hyperkalaemia; in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients compared with patients with renal function; in diabetics compared with nondiabetics; for route of administration of beta-2 agonists (IV versus nebulised versus aerosolised); and for hypertonic sodium bicarbonate compared with isotonic sodium bicarbonate. However, because of the small number of studies that provided data that could be combined, none of these subgroup analyses was possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of each relevant study was characterised independently by two pairs of reviewers (BAM and WADS for studies before 1999; DL and KT for studies from 1999).</P>
<P>Studies were categorised as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>RCTs,</LI>
<LI>randomised crossover trials, or</LI>
<LI>quasi-RCTs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following information was extracted:</P>
<UL>
<LI>allocation concealment,</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants, blinding of investigators, blinding of outcome assessment,</LI>
<LI>intention-to-treat analysis,</LI>
<LI>completeness of follow-up (&gt; 80%).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We did not combine these quality items into a composite score. Studies were not excluded from the review on the basis of quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We planned to examine heterogeneity using Chi² and considering P &lt; 0.10 as statistically significant, and the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cross-over studies</HEADING>
<P>We planned to use data from the time period prior to crossing over. However, we found none of the studies reported the two time periods separately, and we extracted the data as reported for all the patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Possible duplicate publications</HEADING>
<P>When it appeared that there might be overlap in patient populations between two reports, we contacted authors to clarify the issue. If they did not respond, we used only data from the more recent publication.</P>

<P>Most studies reported serum potassium levels at different time points after the initiation of the intervention. Most of the interventions studied had been examined in only one trial, and therefore combining data across studies was not possible. However, four studies comparing inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) with placebo were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Allon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Allon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mandelberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pancu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pancu 2003</LINK>). Of these, one study compared two different doses (10 mg and 20 mg) of inhaled salbutamol with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Allon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1989</LINK>). We chose the data from the higher of the two doses for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A random effects model was used to combine outcomes for inhaled salbutamol versus placebo. The primary outcome was serum potassium at 30 minutes. Other time points as reported in the original papers have also been also shown.<BR/>
<BR/>In one of the studies of inhaled salbutamol included in the meta-analysis, standard deviations were given for the treatment group but not for the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Mandelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mandelberg 1999</LINK>). In this case, the standard deviations for the control group were assumed to equal those of the control group at each time point. For a number of other comparisons, standard error of the means were given. In one case, neither standard error or standard deviations were given (<LINK REF="STD-Ngugi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ngugi 1997</LINK>). In this case, the missing standard deviations were entered as zeros and the data were not included in the pooled analyses.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pancu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pancu 2003</LINK>) reported either standard deviations or standard errors without stating which were used. Another study did not consistently report variances (<LINK REF="STD-Ngugi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ngugi 1997</LINK>). In some cases it was not explicitly stated whether standard error or standard deviation was reported for some or all of the values extracted. In these cases, we assumed that authors had used the same metric throughout, so that if standard errors were mentioned anywhere in the paper, the data were treated as standard errors in our analysis. In some papers, the standard deviation of absolute post-treatment values in the different groups were not reported. In these cases, we calculated the standard deviation of the absolute potassium value at each time point from the standard error of the difference, sample size per group, and standard deviation of the absolute value at baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>None of the studies of clinically-relevant hyperkalaemia reported mortality or cardiac arrhythmias. Reports focussed on serum potassium levels. Characteristics are shown in the table of included studies. All appeared to be studies of convenience samples of patients with modest hyperkalaemia and either acute or chronic renal insufficiency. No study reported the emergency management of life-threatening hyperkalaemia. A number of studies did not report absolute values of serum potassium for time points later than baseline, or did not report variance in a usable way. Some papers reported change in potassium and standard error of the change, rather than the absolute values of potassium, and standard errors or standard deviations of the absolute values at different time points. These problems limited the number of studies from which combinable data could be extracted. For this reason, effect sizes and statistical significance for each individual study are described below, and are shown in the additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">The evidence</HEADING>
<P>Because of the deleterious cardiac effects of hyperkalaemia, its management is an emergency intervention. We reviewed the evidence for various agents widely used for this problem. Heterogeneity in recommendations of experts in this scenario has been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Iqbal-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iqbal 1989</LINK>) and is in keeping with the lack of clear evidence for the optimal regime.</P>
<P>There is evidence that the commonly practiced management options (salbutamol, insulin with glucose, dialysis) are effective. Salbutamol is effective when administered intravenously, nebulised, or as metered dose inhaler with spacer (MDS-I). While bicarbonate was found to be effective in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ngugi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ngugi 1997</LINK>), it did not lower serum potassium below baseline in another (<LINK REF="STD-Allon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1996</LINK>). Though resins are widely used clinically, there was no randomised evidence for their efficacy in an emergency setting, and one study showed no benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Gruy_x002d_Kapral-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gruy-Kapral 1998</LINK>). Aminophylline, which is not commonly used in emergency management of hyperkalaemia, was found to be as effective as insulin and glucose, and safe. Combination of treatment modalities produced greater magnitudes of potassium lowering effect (<LINK REF="STD-Allon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Allon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1995</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Allon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1996</LINK>) found that when IV bicarbonate was added to salbutamol or to IV insulin-glucose therapy there was no additional benefit. Based on the reporting of variance estimates in this study, an effect estimate could not be calculated for this review.</P>
<P>No studies were identified which examined the role of increasing urine output (e.g. by fluid resuscitation, if appropriate; or by loop diuretics) to promote potassium excretion. Resins did not appear to be effective at four hours, though the dose of resin (30 g) used in the one study of this subject is lower than doses commonly used in clinical practice for the emergency management of hyperkalaemia. Since the site of action of resin is thought to be the colon, it is also possible that resins are not effective in the first few hours when given orally, but require longer to act. We are aware of two non-randomised studies that provided evidence of a potassium-lowering effect at 24 h exists for calcium resonium and sodium polystyrene sulphonate (Kayexalate) (<LINK REF="REF-Berlyne-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlyne 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scherr-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherr 1961</LINK>). Dialysis with a low potassium bath (<LINK REF="STD-Zehnder-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zehnder 2001</LINK>) and high blood flow rate (<LINK REF="STD-Gutzwiller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gutzwiller 2003</LINK>) was effective and safe.</P>
<P>No studies discussed the use of calcium salts given intravenously. The prevention of arrhythmia in the setting of hyperkalaemia was first observed by Ringer in 1883 (<LINK REF="REF-Ringer-1883" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringer 1883</LINK>) and corroborated by Winkler (<LINK REF="REF-Winkler-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winkler 1939</LINK>) and Thuillier (<LINK REF="REF-Thuillier-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thuillier 1952</LINK>). Meroney (<LINK REF="REF-Meroney-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meroney 1955</LINK>) found IV calcium to be effective both in the treatment and prophylaxis of hyperkalaemia in humans. By the time of Chamberlain's classic review article on the emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1964</LINK>), the role of IV calcium in this setting appears to have been established.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>There were three double-blinded studies (<LINK REF="STD-Allon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Allon 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mandelberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pancu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pancu 2003</LINK>). Allocation concealment was unclear in most of the studies. The sample sizes were small. Most studies did not comment on the number of participants completing the studies. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ngugi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ngugi 1997</LINK>), 90% of the patients completed the study period, the other 10% were started on dialysis before the end of the study period. Cointerventions were not explicitly described in any of the papers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Given the small numbers of studies in each analysis we were not able to perform any analyses for publication bias. Publication bias may well exist in this literature, and would be expected to result in overestimating treatment effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Tests for heterogeneity are underpowered in analysis which include as few studies as are included in our analysis, and we do not think that much weight can be ascribed to the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity in our analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Generalizability</HEADING>
<P>Most of studies were in patients with ESRD which serves as a convenient model because patients are often mildly hyperkalaemic when due for dialysis. In addition, the absence of significant renal function simplifies the experiment, and increases generalizability to patients with reduced renal function, whether acute or chronic, in whom problems with hyperkalaemia are more likely. There is no good biological reason why treatment modalities that are effective in ESRD patients would not be applicable to the general population; however, it is possible that treatments that are ineffective or of equivocal effectiveness (e.g. IV bicarbonate) in patients with ESRD might still be effective in patients with normal renal function.<BR/>
<BR/>With the exception of dialysis, the treatment options are generally convenient, widely available, and feasible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of current evidence</HEADING>
<P>All the studies reported surrogate outcomes for efficacy, and not all commented on clinically-important adverse events. With the possible exception of <LINK REF="STD-Ngugi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ngugi 1997</LINK>, all studies appeared to have been conducted in convenience samples of mildly-hyperkalaemic individuals. Studies were in general small, and few comparisons of interventions were studied repeatedly. In many cases, standard deviations or standard errors were not reported numerically and were extracted from graphs. In one case, no variance estimates were reported. In other cases, whether error bars represented standard deviations or standard errors was not clearly reported and was inferred from data reported elsewhere in the same article. Statistical comparisons provided in the original article frequently reported changes from baseline and the statistical significance of this comparison, rather than the comparison between randomised groups. Very few data are available on the optimal combination of agents. No data were found on the role of IV calcium salts.</P>

We were unable to extract data from the first time period, before crossing over, from those studies which were cross over studies. This results in the inclusion of data that were not truly independent in the meta-analysis. We chose to leave these studies in the analysis because in each case we felt the wash-out period was adequate (usually 2-3 days) and because they represent a significant proportion of the available data.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of a beta-agonist appeared to be effective in rapid reduction of hyperkalaemia in both the setting of chronic renal failure adults and in children. Salbutamol is effective when given intravenously), in a nebulised form and as a multi-dose inhaler. </P>
<P>IV insulin and glucose is effective and has a rapid onset of action.</P>
<P>The evidence for the use of bicarbonate in hyperkalaemia is equivocal and we do not recommend its use as monotherapy. If used in conjunction with other treatments, the possible effects on pH and extracellular volume must be carefully considered in the assessment of the risk-benefit ratio for an individual patient.</P>
<P>Combining insulin-glucose with salbutamol (albuterol) probably leads to greater reductions in serum potassium than either alone.</P>
<P>Each of the treatments above relies on shifting potassium from extracellular to intracellular compartments in order to minimize its effects on the electrical stability of membranes. In animal and human studies, IV calcium stabilizes membranes and reduces the arrhythmic threshold. Though no randomised evidence exists to support its use, we recommend that calcium chloride (10 mL of 10%) be given in the presence of ECG changes or arrhythmia and repeated as needed. There is no randomised evidence that potassium-exchange resins are effective. In the absence of gastrointestinal pathology, these agents are safe, and may be instituted for their possible effects at 24 hours, but should not be relied upon for rapid effects. If medical therapy fails, or is deemed to be only a temporising measure because of concurrent renal failure, dialysis should be considered. Low-potassium and potassium-free dialysate (<LINK REF="STD-Zehnder-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zehnder 2001</LINK>) and high blood flow (<LINK REF="STD-Gutzwiller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gutzwiller 2003</LINK>) are safe and effective in these circumstances. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The current body of evidence lacks large RCTs that are double-blinded, with clear allocation concealment. The dose-response relationship observed for salbutamol (albuterol) deserves further study, particularly with respect to optimising the reduction in serum potassium while minimizing adverse effects. The observation of additive benefits from the combination of insulin-glucose with salbutamol (albuterol) should be confirmed in a larger study. The evidence for bicarbonate is unclear, and well-designed randomized trials that address the effectiveness of isotonic and hypertonic bicarbonate when added nebulised salbutamol or to insulin and glucose are needed. A RCT of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) and of calcium resonium, examining the time course of action of these agents would be of value.</P>
<P>Trials in patients with clinically-important hyperkalaemia, though difficult to conduct, could compare therapies known to be effective on the basis of studies of convenience samples, and collect information on clinically-important outcomes such as harm, arrhythmia and death. </P>
