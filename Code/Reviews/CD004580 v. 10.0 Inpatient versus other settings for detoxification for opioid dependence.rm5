<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-25 13:05:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dependence on opioid drugs, such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, is a serious problem in many societies. Opioids are very difficult to quit using. The first step to quitting is detoxification, which can cause a number of painful symptoms as the drug withdraws from the body. Many people choose an inpatient detoxification program rather than trying to stop using opioids on their own. In an inpatient program, medications such as methadone can ease the symptoms of withdrawal and patients are in a secure, supportive environment with no access to opiates. However, inpatient programs are expensive and can disrupt patients' lives. An increasing number of outpatient programs are available, providing medication and some support while keeping the drug user in the community. In addition to drop-in programs, there are day centres and even residential facilities which are not staffed 24 hours, unlike inpatient programs. The authors of this review looked for research comparing inpatient and other types of opiate withdrawal programs to see which is more effective. They found only one study from 1975, which had 40 participants. The study suggested inpatient therapy might be more effective than outpatient therapy in the short-term, but all of the inpatients relapsed within three months after detoxification. Since they found only one outdated study which included very few patients, the Cochrane review authors could not conclude whether inpatient treatment is more effective than outpatient or other settings. More research must be done to measure the benefits and costs of inpatient detoxification, especially for more severely dependent users.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-05-26 11:29:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>There are a complex range of variables that can influence the course and subjective severity of opioid withdrawal. There is a growing evidence for the effectiveness of a range of medically-supported detoxification strategies, but little attention has been paid to the influence of the setting in which the process takes place.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of any inpatient opioid detoxification programme when compared with all other time-limited detoxification programmes on the level of completion of detoxification, the intensity and duration of withdrawal symptoms, the nature and incidence of adverse effects, the level of engagement in further treatment post-detoxification, and the rates of relapse post-detoxification.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-26 11:29:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2008); MEDLINE (January 1966-May 2008); EMBASE (January 1988-May 2008); PsycInfo (January 1967-May 2008); CINAHL (January 1982-May 2008).

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing inpatient opioid detoxification (any drug or psychosocial therapy) with other time-limited detoxification programmes (including residential units that are not staffed 24 hours per day, day-care facilities where the patient is not resident for 24 hours per day, and outpatient or ambulatory programmes, and using any drug or psychosocial therapy).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All abstracts were independently inspected by two reviewers (ED &amp; JI) and relevant papers were retrieved and assessed for methodological quality using Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one study met the inclusion criteria. This did not explicitly report the number of participants in each group that successfully completed the detoxification process, but the published data allowed us to deduce that 7 out of 10 (70%) in the inpatient detoxification group were opioid-free on discharge, compared with 11 out of 30 (37%) in the outpatient group. There was very limited data about the other outcomes of interest. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-26 11:35:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>This review is in line with a series of Cochrane reviews of the Drug and Alcohol Review Group seeking to evaluate a variety of different therapeutic interventions for the medical management of the Opiate Withdrawal Syndrome in adults. Therefore much of the background overlaps with that of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004d</LINK>) and some is reproduced unaltered.</P>
<P>Dependence on opioid drugs is a major health and social issue in most societies. Although the prevalence of opioid use is low - for example, surveys in Australia and the European Union indicate that up two to three per cent of the general population has ever used opioids for non-medical purposes (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2002</LINK>) - the burden of disease is substantial. The burden to the individual user and the community of opioid dependence arises from mortality (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1997</LINK>), which is most marked in the 15 to 34 year age group (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1998</LINK>), transmission of HIV and hepatitis C, health care costs, crime and law enforcement costs (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Healey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1997</LINK>), as well as the less tangible costs of family disruption and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The provision of treatment has a major influence on the reduction of the harms to the individual and the community from opioid dependence. However detoxification, or managed withdrawal, is not in itself an adequate treatment for dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). Rates of completion of withdrawal tend to be low and rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high (<LINK REF="REF-Milby-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milby 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaillant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaillant 1988</LINK>), but withdrawal remains a required first step for many forms of longer-term treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). It may also represent the end point of an extensive period of treatment such as methadone maintenance or another form of substitution therapy. As such, the availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.</P>
<P>Recent reviews have highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of different medical detoxification strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2004d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2004d</LINK>), and in addition there is a complex range of other variables that can influence the course and subjective severity (or intensity) of withdrawal. This includes the type of opioid used, dose taken, duration of use, general physical health, and psychological factors such as the reasons for undertaking withdrawal and fear of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frank-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milby-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milby 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1985</LINK>). Outcomes of a withdrawal treatment episode may also be influenced by what happens prior to detoxification, as a period of methadone maintenance treatment is likely to produce a degree of stabilisation in health and social terms that may facilitate successful withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Backmund-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backmund 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another key variable influencing likelihood of completion of detoxification is setting. Many people with opioid dependence have difficulty achieving abstinence in the community, citing the proximity of drug-using friends and associates, family stressors and lack of support. Treatment programmes delivered in residential settings play an important role in the national provision of treatment services for problem substance users in many countries throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1995</LINK>). Both American and British national outcome studies have provided evidence of important clinical improvements among clients treated in residential programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Craddock-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craddock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1982</LINK>). Both have also concluded that length of time spent in treatment is an important predictor of post-treatment outcomes. However there is less known about the relative effectiveness of the inpatient setting for the detoxification phase of treatment.</P>
<P>In the UK the national specialist inpatient drug dependence units were established in psychiatric hospitals in the late 1960s. Inpatient programmes currently provide beds in both dedicated drug dependence units and in general psychiatric wards under the care of drug dependence specialists. As part of a wider movement in psychiatry in many countries bed numbers have reduced dramatically since the 1950s. Thus, despite the steady increase in the size of the opioid problem, the number of in-patient beds available for opioid detoxification programmes has diminished broadly in parallel with the general psychiatric beds.</P>
<P>During the same period the development of new techniques for detoxification has enabled safe detoxification from heroin and other opioid drugs in the community, and there has been a tendency to view hospital-based detoxification as expensive and unnecessary in all but the most complicated cases (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1999</LINK>). Outpatient detoxification clearly has some advantages in that it does not involve as much disruption to the patient and their family and offers them the possibility of continuing with their normal daily routine. It also requires them to cope with everyday situations which they will encounter on their discharge from hospital, and so may promote better coping skills. However, supplies of illicit drugs are likely to be more readily available at a time when the temptation to use will be high, possibly leading to higher relapse rates. Furthermore medical complications of detoxification are not as easily managed at home, and the process may have to be slower (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further important issue is that of cost. In simple terms detoxification in an inpatient setting appears to be much more expensive. Gossop and Strang have calculated that a three-week inpatient detoxification programme costs nine times more than an eight-week outpatient programme. However, when adjustments were made for different levels of successful outcome the costs of inpatient and outpatient treatment are almost identical (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 2000</LINK>). Therefore discussion of treatment costs is misleading if not informed by (and adjusted for) evidence of effectiveness.</P>
<P>This review considers the evidence for the effectiveness of the inpatient setting as compared to non-inpatient settings for detoxification from opioids. The primary outcome of interest is whether the person is opioid-free at the end of the planned treatment period, but longer term outcomes such as engagement in treatment and relapse to opioid use will also be examined. The influence of treatment setting upon completion of detoxification is an under-researched area that has important clinical and financial implications for the treatment of opioid dependence. To the authors' knowledge there has been no previous review of this topic and this review aims to highlight any gaps in the evidence base for best practice in this area.</P>

<P>
<B>(1) Excluded studies</B>
<BR/>One study was identified from the abstract as potentially suitable (<LINK REF="STD-Vidjak-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vidjak 2003</LINK>) in that it involved a systematic allocation of 90 heroin addicts to either methadone, hospital, or therapeutic community treatment. However, on analysis of the paper it became clear that the study was retrospective and did not involve randomisation.</P>
<P>In a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Gossop-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 1986</LINK>) the 60 participants (45 men and 15 women) were all patients of a Drug Dependence Clinic, and most (47, 78%) were primarily dependent on heroin. They were assigned the participants to one of four groups: the randomised outpatient group, the randomised inpatient group, the preferred outpatient group, and the preferred inpatient group. All participants were asked if they were prepared to accept either inpatient or outpatient withdrawal. Those subjects who were willing to accept either were then assigned to one of the two randomised groups. Those who expressed a strong preference for inpatient or outpatient withdrawal were assigned to the appropriate preference group.<BR/>The inpatient treatment programme lasted for 21 days. The outpatient programme lasted for 56 days and entailed weekly attendance at the clinic for counselling. Both withdrawal schemes used oral methadone, the dose of which was reduced on a daily basis using a linear (equal dose) reduction model. The principal aim was to achieve abstinence at the end of the supervised withdrawal regime, and abstinence was confirmed by urine analysis. A total of 25 (81%) of the 31 participants in the inpatient withdrawal group were successfully withdrawn from opioid drugs (and all other drugs, including alcohol), whereas only 5 (17%) of the 29 participants in the outpatient withdrawal group achieved abstinence. However, only 20 of the total sample of 60 were actually randomised, and although the authors comment on 'the complete failure of the randomised outpatient group', the number of participants actually randomised to inpatient or outpatient treatment is not reported. The study was therefore excluded from the review. </P>
<P>
<B>(2) Included studies</B>
<BR/>Only one study was identified that met the inclusion criteria for the review (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK>).</P>

<B>
<I>(a) Participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> the participants were all physically dependent on heroin and had pharmacological evidence of current drug use through urinalysis or clinical evidence of the opioid withdrawal syndrome. The 40 participants had a mean age of 22 years, and although the sex ratio is not reported the authors comment that the group 'tended to be white, single and male'. For nearly 75% of the sample this was the first withdrawal treatment experience.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>
<I>(b) Interventions</I>
</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> randomly assigned participants to hospital detoxification or outpatient detoxification. The hospital detoxification group was supervised by three psychiatrists on an open ward of an acute psychiatric treatment service in a general hospital. The detoxification was performed using methadone, although exact details of the process are not reported beyond that the psychiatrists used 'their usual narcotic detoxification procedure with the single limitation that dosage of methadone would not exceed 40mg in any 24-hour period'. No prescribed length of treatment was imposed on the hospital participants, and those who felt stabilised or requested to leave were discharged. Participants were expected to participate in ward activities and group meetings. The outpatient detoxification group also received methadone, and were supervised by one psychiatrist. All methadone doses were given under the direct supervision of the clinic nurse, and the procedure occurred in a fixed 10-day period. Withdrawal was accomplished by starting with a flexible dose of 10-20mg of methadone and stabilising at a maximum of 40mg daily on day 2-3. Dosage was then individualised, but no more than 30mg of methadone was administered on days 4 or 5, no more than 20mg on days 6 or 7, and no more than 10mg on days 8, 9, or 10. All participants were offered individual counselling by the psychiatrist and clinic nurses. Both groups were also offered supportive medication as clinically indicated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> reported drug use during treatment (as measured by self-report and urine analysis) and the length of the heroin-free period after detoxification treatment. The authors also reported the average cost of both treatment modalities.</P>

<B>(1) Randomization</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> reported randomly allocating participants to different treatment modalities, but did not describe the method used to generate random allocation. Furthermore, significant methodological problems surrounding randomisation were identified. The authors reported randomly allocating patients accepted for treatment to either hospital or outpatient detoxification, but also that some patients refused treatment rather than accept hospitalisation. This may explain why 30 of the 40 study participants were in the outpatient treatment group and only 10 were in the inpatient group.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> did not report that staff collecting or analysing the outcome data were blinded to the participants' treatment modality.</P>

<B>(3) Losses to follow up</B>
<BR/>Although it is not explicitly reported, it would appear that approximately 20 participants dropped out of the <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> study after randomisation and prior to starting inpatient treatment. If this was the case, the results are not reported on an intention-to-treat basis and are therefore likely to be biased in favour of inpatient treatment. As the exact number of dropouts is not reported, it would not be appropriate to subject the study to further quantitative analysis.</P>

<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1975</LINK> study does not explicitly report the number of participants in each group that successfully completed the detoxification process. The authors reported data about relapse to heroin use after detoxification treatment, and from this it is possible to deduce that 7 out of 10 (70%) in the inpatient detoxification group were opioid-free on discharge, compared with 11 out of 30 (37%) in the outpatient group.

Of the remaining seven, one resumed heroin use within 24 hours of discharge, one within one week, two within one month, two within two months, and one within three months. In the outpatient sample 10 (33%) of the participants were lost to follow-up, and one patient assigned to the group did not initiate treatment. A further eight (27%) never stopped using heroin despite receiving methadone. Two reported return to heroin use within one week of treatment, five within two months, and one resumed without specifying the time period. Two participants were still heroin-free when last contacted two months after treatment. Unfortunately the authors did nor report the frequency of contact with the participants in the follow-up period, and the method of determining relapse to heroin (urinary analysis or self-report) is not specified.<BR/>

The average cost of the hospital treatment was US$91 per day or US$496 for a treatment programme with an average patient stay of 5.4 days.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Inpatient detoxification is an expensive process requiring considerable resources, and therefore it is surprising that so few clinical studies have examined its effectiveness. Both studies produced by the literature searching process were small and had methodological limitations, and only one met the inclusion criteria for the review. Both made use of methadone reduction as a detoxification method, and newer techniques are now available that have generally increased opioid detoxification rates in the community setting (<LINK REF="REF-Akhurst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akhurst 1999</LINK>). Neither study reports longer-term outcomes in any detail, so it is difficult to determine whether inpatient detoxification has other benefits.</P>
<P>Non-randomised studies comparing inpatients and outpatients typically show that the former have more severe substance use histories and a greater prevalence of medical, psychosocial and vocational difficulties, including less social stability, more unemployment and a greater preponderance of medical and psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>). However, these data reflect referral patterns and not which populations fare best in each setting. Inpatient detoxification is generally considered to be indicated for those individuals who have too many adverse prognostic features to be successful at detoxification as an outpatient (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1999</LINK>). In practice, not only are such individuals also the least likely to complete detoxification as an inpatient, but they are often especially unable to tolerate the constraints of a hospital setting. This has been described as the 'severity paradox', in which success is unlikely in those who are particularly considered to require the approach (<LINK REF="REF-Seivewright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seivewright 2000</LINK>), and is likely to have arisen due to economic restraints rather than clinical evidence. Despite evidence that inpatient provision for drug detoxification is diminishing (<LINK REF="REF-Mark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mark 2002</LINK>), this review suggests that practice in the field continues to be lead by clinical experience and intuition rather than evidence.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is a lack of good quality research evidence available to guide practice in this area. Detoxification is an essential first step in achieving lifelong abstinence, but little attention has been paid to the effect of treatment setting (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). Given the potential cost of inpatient treatment, it is perhaps surprising that a search of the world literature in this area yielded only two randomised controlled trials, both with significant methodological limitations. The only real conclusion that can be drawn is that there is very little available research to guide the clinician about the longer-term outcomes or cost-effectiveness of inpatient or outpatient approaches.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Reviews in the alcohol research field have concluded that there is no evidence for the superiority of inpatient over outpatient treatment of alcohol abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1986</LINK>). However, extrapolation of these results to the treatment of other substance users must be done with caution, and better designed research is needed to confirm this conclusion for opioid dependent individuals. The randomised controlled trial is usually the methodology of choice for determining which treatment option is best. However, in the case of inpatient opioid detoxification there is a problem of equipoise, whereby the patients who theoretically might benefit most from the treatment are often excluded from randomised trials. Patients with opioid dependence and co-existing mental illness, severe social isolation or dependence on other substances are often considered too unwell to attempt detoxification anywhere else other than an inpatient setting. Therefore they are often excluded from clinical trials, and this is likely to reduce any possible advantages that treatment in an in-patient setting may convey (<LINK REF="REF-Finney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finney 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, the few studies that have looked at the effect of setting on detoxification outcomes have involved too few participants to provide sufficient statistical power to detect potential differences. It is important to remember that a failure to detect a difference in these circumstances is not the same as proving that no benefit exists.</P>
<P>From a clinician's perspective there is a small group of patients who will benefit from undertaking detoxification in more supportive settings. Therefore, one profitable research strategy may be to develop good quality prospective studies to look at the outcomes of patients with complex problems after inpatient admission. This would allow the testing of hypotheses concerning predictive factors for good treatment outcomes in particular populations (e.g. people with a co-existing severe mental illness, people dependent on more than one substance). There is also some evidence that detoxification in an inpatient environment may increase the likelihood of engaging the patient in longer term care (<LINK REF="REF-Ghodse-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghodse 2002</LINK>), and such a prospective cohort study would be suitable for examining such issues. </P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Participants accepted for treatment were randomly assigned to hospital detoxification (HD) or outpatient detoxification (OPD). The hospital unit was an open ward of an acute psychiatric treatment service in a general hospital.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>40 participants<BR/>Over 18 years old (mean age 22 years)<BR/>Seeking narcotic (heroin) detoxification<BR/>Criteria for admission to treatment included evidence of physical dependence on narcotics and pharmacological evidence of current drug use through urinalysis or clinical evidence of the narcotic withdrawal syndrome<BR/>33% were employed<BR/>40% were living with their parents<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>(1) Hospital detoxification - supervised by 3 psychiatrists and followed their normal detoxification procedure with the single limitation that dosage of methadone would not exceed 40mg in any 24-hour period. No prescribed length of treatment was imposed, and patients who felt stabilized or requested to leave were discharged.<BR/>(2) Outpatient detoxification - supervised by 1 psychiatrist. Detoxification was accomplished in a 10 day period by starting with a flexible dose of 10 to 20mg of methadone and stabilizing at a maximum dose of 40mg daily on the second or third day of treatment. Dosage was individualized, but no more than 30mg of methadone was administered on days 4 or 5, no more than 20mg on days 6 or 7, and no more than 10mg on days 8,9, or 10.<BR/>All participants were offered individual counselling by the psychiatrist and clinic nurses.<BR/>Both groups were offered supportive medication as clinically indicated.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Hospital detoxification - 7 out of 10 (70%) subjects were drug free at the end of the detoxification period<BR/>Outpatient detoxification - 11 out of 30 (37%) participants were drug free at the end of the detoxification period<BR/>One third of both groups were lost to follow-up.<BR/>All hospital detoxification patients had returned to heroin use within 3 months of treatment<BR/>All but two of the outpatient detoxification patients had returned to heroin use within 2 months of treatment, and one of these was in prison</P>

<P>Some patients refused treatment rather than accept hospitalisation. Ten patients were assigned to HD and 30 patients to OPD, suggesting that about 20 patients dropped out of the HD group.</P>

<P>60 participants (45 men, 15 women), all physically dependent on opiates and asking to be withdrawn.<BR/>Participants were asked if they were prepared to accept either inpatient or outpatient opiate withdrawal, and those who were willing to do so were assigned randomly to the randomised inpatient or randomised outpatient group.
