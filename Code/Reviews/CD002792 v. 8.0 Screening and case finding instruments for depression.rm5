<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The use of depression screening or case finding instruments has little or no impact on the recognition, management or outcome of depression in primary care or the general hospital.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Screening or case finding instruments have been advocated as a simple, quick and inexpensive method to improve detection and management of depression in non-specialist settings, such as primary care and the general hospital. However, screening/case finding is just one of a number of strategies that have been advocated to improve the quality of care for depression. The adoption of this seemingly simple and effective strategy should be underpinned by evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of screening and case finding instruments in: (1) improving the recognition of depression; (2) improving the management of depression, and (3) improving the outcome of depression. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The researchers undertook electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004); The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Register [2004); EMBASE (1980-2004); MEDLINE (1966-2004); CINAHL (to 2004) and PsycLIT (1974-2004). References of all identified studies were searched for further trials, and the researchers contacted authors of trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of the administration of case finding/screening instruments for depression and the feedback of the results of these instruments to clinicians, compared with no clinician feedback. Trials had to be conducted in non-mental health settings, such as primary care or the general hospital. Studies that used screening strategies in addition to enhanced care, such as case management and structured follow up, were specifically excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by researchers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Data relating to: (1) the recognition of depression; (2) the management of depression and (3) the outcome of depression over time were sought. For dichotomous data the Relative Risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, weighted and standardised mean difference were calculated. A series of a priori sensitivity analyses relating to the method of administration of questionnaires and population under study were used to examine plausible causes of heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve studies (including 5693 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Synthesis of these data gave the following results:<BR/>(1) the recognition of depression: according to case note entries of depression, screening/case finding instruments had borderline impact on the overall recognition of depression by clinicians (relative risk 1.38; 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.83). However, substantial heterogeneity was found for this outcome. Screening and feedback, irrespective of baseline score of depression has no impact on the detection of depression (relative risk 1.00; 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.13). In contrast, three small positive studies using a two stage selective procedure, whereby patients were screened and only patients scoring above a certain threshold were entered into the trial, did suggest that this approach might be effective (relative risk 2.66; 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 3.96). Separate pooling according to this variable reduced the overall level of heterogeneity. Publication bias was also found for this outcome.<BR/>(2) the management of depression: according to case note entries for active interventions and prescription data, a selected subsample of all studies reported this outcome and found that there was there was an overall trend to showing a borderline higher intervention rate amongst those who received feedback of screening/case finding instruments (relative risk 1.35; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.85), although substantial heterogeneity between studies existed for this outcome. This result was dependant upon the presence of one highly positive study.<BR/>(3) the outcome of depression: few studies reported the impact of case finding/screening instruments on the actual outcome of depression, and no statistical pooling was possible. However, three out of four studies reported no clinical effect (p&lt;0.05) at either six months or twelve months. <BR/>No studies examined the cost effectiveness of screening/case finding as a strategy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is substantial evidence that routinely administered case finding/screening questionnaires for depression have minimal impact on the detection, management or outcome of depression by clinicians. Practice guidelines and recommendations to adopt this strategy, in isolation, in order to improve the quality of healthcare should be resisted. The longer term benefits and costs of routine screening/case finding for depression have not been evaluated. A two stage procedure for screening/case finding may be effective, but this needs to be evaluated in a large scale cluster randomised trial, with a prospective economic evaluation.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 18:52:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Depression affects between 5% and 10% of individuals and is the third most common reason for consultation in general practice/primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Singleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 2001</LINK>). Eighty percent of patients with depression consult with non-specific physical complaints (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1999</LINK>), without spontaneously divulging the psychological nature of their problems (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1986</LINK>). It has been reported that depressive symptoms are not recognized in around 50% of attending patients with depressive disorders (ascertained by research diagnostic interview) in general practice/primary care (<LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>). Similar problems are also found in general hospital settings, where there is substantial under identification and unmet need (<LINK REF="REF-Katon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katon 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression is associated with marked reduction in functional capacity and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1989</LINK>). Use of general medical services by depressed patients is 50% to 100% higher than utilisation by similar patients without depressive illness (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1997</LINK>). The increased economic burden of depression arises due the loss of functioning and productivity and the increased utilisation of medical services, and exceeds the resources devoted to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of approaches have been advocated to improve the quality of care for depression in non specialist settings. One approach involves enhancements in the process of care, such as case management (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 2001</LINK>). Another approach involves the use of educational strategies, aimed at improving the skills and practice of non-specialist health professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>). One solution that has been advocated is the use of brief self report measures of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1994</LINK>), which can be used to aid identification - hitherto referred to as case finding/screening instruments. Some interventions have included combinations of all three of these approaches - enhanced care, clinician education and screening (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1989</LINK>). Approaches using screening alone may seem superficially appealing in that instruments are available which are brief; easy to administer and score; psychometrically robust (valid and reliable) and acceptable to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of screening instruments has been supported in important policy pronouncements, including guidelines issued by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Pignone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignone 2002</LINK>) and the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). The potential for these instruments to improve the behaviour of non-specialists in their ability to recognise and manage depression is substantial, but cannot be assumed. The administration of screening and case finding instruments is also not a cost-neutral exercise. The administration of questionnaires for each and every patient in primary care and general hospital settings will require the investment of substantial resources and time.</P>
<P>Even simplistic quality improvement strategies must be supported by evidence of clinical benefit and cost effectiveness. We therefore set out to undertake a systematic review of randomised evaluations of the impact of routine screening and case finding for depression. Our review specifically addresses the use of screening instruments alone, rather than interventions which also offer substantial enhancement in the process of care (such as active case management).</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies must include:<BR/>1. Patients in non-psychiatric settings, such as general hospital patients and non-selected general practice attenders.</P>
<P>Studies relating to the following patient groups were excluded:<BR/>1. Patients being managed by specialist psychiatric services.<BR/>2. Child and adolescent populations.<BR/>3. Those with learning disabilities or dementia.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Included studies were those comparing the introduction of a routine form of screening or case finding assessment with a normal routine pattern of care. </P>
<P>Routine care (the control/comparator condition) involved usual patient-doctor interaction, with non-standardised history taking, investigation, referral, intervention and follow up. This did not usually involve the use of screening/case finding instruments, but relied on the traditional channels of patient doctor communication and informal assessment of outcome using clinical history taking, psychiatric/physical examination and recording of progress in clinical notes.</P>
<P>The active intervention involved the addition of a standardised screening/outcome assessment instrument to routine care, with information from the screening/case finding assessment being fed back to the clinician. Hence, depression could be assessed by researchers in both intervention and control conditions, but the active component in an intervention involved the <I>feeding back </I>of this information to the clinician.</P>
<P>Depression screening or case finding instruments (i.e. those actively incorporated into routine care) could be either self-completed or interviewer-completed paper and pencil questionnaires. Broader measures of quality of life, which often contain a mental health component, in addition to questions on physical functioning, social functioning and cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Bowling-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowling 1997</LINK>) have also been subject to systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2002</LINK>), and are excluded from the present review</P>
<P>Studies that include substantial enhancements in the process of care - such as the use of case managers or a 'collaborative care' approach were not included in this reviews, since these involve a complex package of care, of which screening might only form a component (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 2001</LINK>). The effectiveness of screening within these studies will be difficult to disentangle from other active components. Case management and collaborative care have already been subject to systematic review (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003a</LINK>) and a related Cochrane review of this topic is currently underway.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcome was studied as defined by the authors of each study, with particular attention given to the impact of screening/case finding tools on the following:<BR/>
<B>1. Recognition of depression</B> - as indicated by recording a diagnosis of depression or reporting depression as an active problem in case notes.<BR/>
<B>2. Management of depression </B>- as indicated by an active intervention for depression (other than non-specific clinician counseling) by the physician. Such interventions might include outside referral to a specialist mental healthcare professional or the initiation of an empirically supported treatment such as anti-depressants or a specific form of psychotherapy.<BR/>
<B>3. Outcome of depression</B> - as indicated by recovery from depression (however defined) or scores on a depression-specific instrument at follow up.<BR/>
<B>4. Cost </B>(direct and indirect).</P>
<P>Outcomes were classified as short term (0-6 months); medium term (6-12 months) and; longer term (12 months and over).</P>

<P>All potential trials were read by two researchers individually. Each determined if the trial fulfilled inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Assessment: </B>
<BR/>Randomised trials of behavioural interventions, designed to influence clinical practice have to cope with the problem of 'cross contamination' between subjects (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1996</LINK>). For example, a key aim of research summarised in this review is to encourage clinicians to become more aware of, and responsive to, psychological problems through the active feedback standardised questionnaires. However, if clinicians see some patients with and some patients without questionnaire scores, there is a danger that clinical management will change for both intervention and control groups. In other words, receiving feedback for some patients may sensitise the clinician to psychological problems amongst all their patients. The consequence of this 'cross contamination' is that any real advantage of the intervention may be diluted, and no difference may be found between control and intervention arms. One solution to this problem is to use individual clinicians as the unit of randomisation, so that individual clinicians are randomised to receive feedback for all their patients if the clinician is allocated to the intervention arm, and to not receive feedback for any of their patients if the clinician is allocated to a control/usual care arm (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). Hence, those studies which use 'cluster randomisation', where clinicians or clinical teams are the unit of randomisation will be judged to be more robust than those which randomise individual patients. Differences between studies where the patient is the unit of randomisation and those where clinicians are randomised were explored in a sensitivity analysis (see below).</P>
<P>In addition we assessed methodological quality in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, and with the validated scale of Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) which considers method of randomisation, allocation concealment and intention to treat.</P>

<BR/>For those studies which were sufficiently similar in terms of patients, populations, interventions and outcomes, we undertook a quantitative data synthesis using a fixed effects model for non-heterogenous data. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic has several advantages over other measures of heterogeneity such as chi<SUP>2</SUP>, including greater statistical power to detect clinical heterogeneity when fewer studies are available. As a guide, I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 25% may be considered 'low', 50% 'moderate' and 75%, 'high'. Where significant heterogeneity was found (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%), we undertook a random effects meta-analysis, and sought to explore sources of heterogeneity according to specified a priori causes of heterogeneity outlined below. We anticipated in advance that studies may be sufficiently similar in terms of the populations studied and routine instruments used to allow pooling for the following outcomes to be undertaken:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Clinicians' recognition of depression</LI>
<LI>Intervention for depression</LI>
<LI>Severity of depression at follow up</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The analysis maintained the study groups according to the original randomisation procedure, and we synthesised data according to the following procedure:</P>
<P>1. For categorical (binary) outcomes, such as recognition of depression or intervention for depression, we calculated risk ratios (Relative Risk - RR).<BR/>2. For continuous outcomes, such as patient scores on the GHQ and BDI, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) where there was a common metric between studies, and standardised mean differences (SMD) if different scales were used to measure the same underlying construct. Endpoint scores were pooled as a first preference, since assumptions about normality of data can be checked by ensuring that the standard deviation of endpoint scores, when multiplied by 1.65 is less than the mean endpoint score. Pooling was not attempted for data that were non-normally distributed.</P>
<P>For studies which employed a 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or primary care practice), we sought evidence that clustering had been accounted for by the authors of studies in their analysis. Failure to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies is commonly encountered in primary research, and leads to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) - whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated - causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering is not accounted for, we present an (*) symbol next to data. Subsequent versions of this review will seek to contact first authors of studies, to seek intra class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). In the interim, we also adjusted for clustering using a plausible Intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) of 0.05 (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>) to check the robustness of our initial analyses to unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Economic data</B>
<BR/>There are major difficulties encountered when conducting systematic reviews of cost effectiveness data (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 1999</LINK>). First, studies often adopt different perspectives; account for different types of cost data; use different methods of discounting future healthcare costs/benefits and are conducted at different points in time. Second, they are conducted in different countries and healthcare settings with different funding and reimbursement systems, making international comparisons difficult. Third, economic evaluations often make fundamental errors in the analysis of data, by for example, applying parametric analyses to highly skewed cost data. Where cost data are presented and a formal cost effectiveness analysis is undertaken, their methods and results were simply be described. No formal statistical pooling was attempted for cost or cost-effectiveness data.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses</B>
<BR/>We specified a number of a priori sensitivity analyses, in order to explore the effect of the following on the results obtained in this review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Whether the setting of the study or population in receipt of routine screening/case finding influenced the success of the strategy</LI>
<LI>Whether the mode of administration of routine screening and outcome measures (e.g. self completed vs interviewer completed) influenced the success of the strategy.</LI>
<LI>Whether the mode of feedback of results to the clinician influenced the success of the strategy (e.g. presentation of raw scores, with no interpretation/normative values versus feedback of only high scores with a clear written indication that this indicates a likely emotional disorder).</LI>
<LI>Whether cluster randomised studies produced a different result from non-clustered studies.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Where a formal data synthesis had been performed, we visually inspected forest plots to check for obvious between study variation in results and conducted formal tests for heterogeneity. Where significant heterogeneity was found, we sought causes, including the a priori ones outlined above.</P>
<P>
<B>Publication bias</B>
<BR/>Psychiatric research is especially prone to publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003b</LINK>), and we sought evidence of any inherent publication bias in our results by plotting 'funnel plots' where this was feasible (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Funnel plot tests for asymmetry were separately conducted using STATA version 8.0, using the <I>metabias </I>command.</P>

<P>Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>, Whooley* 2000; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zung-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Zung 1983</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<B>Setting</B>
<BR/>Nine studies were conducted in primary care settings, two in general medical outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>), and one in an elderly inpatient setting (<LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>). Details of these studies are provided in 'Characteristics of included studies' section.</P>
<P>
<B>Patients</B>
<BR/>There were broadly two types of patient populations who underwent randomisation: (1) 'unselected feedback', where patients were included, irrespective of their baseline score on the instrument under evaluation or pre-existing probability of having some deficit or disorder as measured on the instrument under evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>; Whooley* 2000; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1999</LINK>), and (2) 'high risk feedback', whereby patients were only randomised if they scored above a certain level on the instrument under evaluation, or were known to have a pre-existing but unrecognised deficit or disorder such as depression (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zung-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Zung 1983</LINK>). For example, an unselected population was recruited by <LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>, who administered the General Health Questionnaire (see below) to all primary care attenders, and randomised these patients to either have their GHQ score fed back to the clinician or to be withheld - irrespective of their score on the GHQ. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK> recruited only patients with a likely pre-existing diagnosis of depression using a two stage procedure. All outpatient attenders were first given the Zung SDI (<LINK REF="REF-Zung-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zung 1965</LINK>), and those with high scores were then screened using a standardised diagnostic interview schedule. Only those with a confirmed diagnosis of hitherto unrecognised depression were then randomised to have their Zung SDI score fed back to clinicians in the course of the interview.</P>
<P>Some studies, by the nature of the services under evaluation (e.g. US veterans administration hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>)) included a greater proportion of elderly patients, or were specifically targeted at elderly patients (Whooley* 2000).</P>
<P>
<B>Screening/case finding instrument</B>
<BR/>The most commonly used instruments were self-completed scales designed to detect depression e.g. Beck Depression Inventory - BDI (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>); General Health Questionnaire - GHQ (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1972</LINK>); Zung SDI (<LINK REF="REF-Zung-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zung 1965</LINK>). Instruments were generally administered in the waiting room by research assistants prior to consultation.</P>
<P>
<B>Active intervention and control</B>
<BR/>The active intervention broadly involved the feedback of instrument test results to the clinician - generally in the form of a sheet containing summary scores and an explanation of the importance of high scores in terms of the likely presence of a psychological disorder. For example, <LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK> provided summary sheets with GHQ scores together with the following statement:<BR/>'<I>it has been shown that above a critical symptom level, a psychiatrist is likely to make a psychiatric diagnosis of a non-psychotic emotional disorder. Higher levels of GHQ scores indicate increasing probability of current emotional distress. A score higher than four is regarded an a 'positive' or abnormal result'<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>The control condition was generally the administration of the case finding instrument to the patient, without the score on this scale being fed back to the clinician. </P>
<P>
<B>Trial endpoints &amp; follow up</B>
<BR/>The most commonly collected trial endpoints were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The detection of depression by the clinician during the course of the clinical interview, and;</LI>
<LI>The initiation of treatment or intervention for depression. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The detection of and treatment for depression was established by the use of clinician questionnaires or interviews following a patient consultation, or by case note review, whereby written evidence was sought to determine whether the clinician had noted a depressive disorder as being present, or if they had initiated any interventions for an emotional problem (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All studies described themselves as 'randomised', with few giving specific details of method of randomisation and concealment of allocation. Failure to specify these facets of design are important since they have been shown to be sources of bias in randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). One study that did give details of method of randomisation, used a suboptimal alternate allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the majority of studies, the unit of randomisation was the individual patient, with individual clinicians seeing both intervention and control patients (i.e. receiving feedback from case finding/screening questionnaires for some patients and not for others). This raises problems of 'cross contamination' between subjects and controls and a Hawthorne effect, whereby practice is changed for both subjects and controls by virtue of participation in a study (<LINK REF="REF-Roethlisberger-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roethlisberger 1939</LINK>). The implications of this facet of study design are explored in more detail in the discussion section. One study used individual clinicians or practices as the unit of randomisation (Whooley* 2000), so that cross contamination was avoided by single clinicians receiving either the control or experimental condition, but not both for their individual patients. This study failed to account for clustering in the analysis of results, making it prone to a 'unit of analysis error' (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sample size varied between 52 and 2209, and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1999</LINK>) included a power calculation or discussion of the sample size required to detect a specified difference in outcomes between treatment and control groups.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>1. Effect of screening/case finding on the recognition of depression/anxiety<BR/>
</B>Nine studies (4194 patients) presented data on the effect of case finding/screening on the recognition of depression (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1999</LINK>; Whooley* 2000). Visual inspection of forest plots and statistical testing for these data demonstrated substantial heterogeneity between studies (chi square=28.44, p=0.00002; I<SUP>2</SUP>=75.4%) and a pooling showed that overall, within this heterogeneous group of studies, screening and case finding had a borderline positive impact on the rate of clinician recognition of depression (eight studies; relative risk 1.38; 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.83). An exploration of possible a priori sources of heterogeneity showed that the most plausible explanation was the method of scoring and patient randomisation. Selection and randomisation of patients according to their pre-existing score being above a certain 'cut off' (high risk feedback) seemed to produce a positive and significant effect size (relative risk 2.66; 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 3.96), whereas 'unselected feedback' produced no improvement in recognition rates by clinicians (relative risk 1.00; 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.13). Subgroup analyses according to this plausible source of heterogeneity sought to reduce the overall levels of statistical heterogeneity (high risk feedback studies: Chi<SUP>2</SUP>=0.2, p=0.99, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%; unselected feedback studies: Chi<SUP>2</SUP>=5.73, p=0.23, I<SUP>2</SUP>=30.2%)</P>
<P>When a test for publication bias was applied to all studies reporting this outcome, an asymmetrical plot was obtained and Eggers's test was significant (Intercept (0 if unbiased) = 2.59; 95% CI = 0.81 to 4.35 p=0.0108). This test became non-significant when only 'unselected feedback' studies were selected.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Effect of screening/case finding on the management of depression</B>
<BR/>Eight studies (2272 patients) presented data on the impact of case finding/screening on management of depression (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>; Whooley* 2000). Interventions for depression were variously defined, and included the prescription of anti-depressants, referral for psychotherapy or counseling, psychiatric referral or referral to a mental health specialist, and stopping drugs that were known to cause depression (especially in the elderly). Sufficient data were provided to allow two comparisons to be made. Firstly, where any of the above interventions were recorded in both intervention and control groups ('any intervention for depression'); and secondly, where the specific prescription or initiation of anti-depressants (an empirically supported treatment) was recorded in both intervention and control groups ('prescription of anti-depressants'). For the outcome 'any intervention for depression', there was a borderline higher intervention rate amongst those who received feedback from screening/case finding instruments (relative risk 1.35; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.85), although substantial heterogeneity between studies existed for this outcome (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>=35.6, p=0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP>=80.3%). This outcome was highly dependant upon the presence of two of the eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>) which showed a much stronger effect size than other studies, and which were also studies that employed 'high risk feedback'. For the outcome 'prescription of anti-depressants', a borderline significant effect size was noted (relative risk 1.15; 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.32). Substantial heterogeneity existed for this outcome (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>=27.4, p=0.00001, I<SUP>2</SUP>=81.8%) and the effect size was highly dependant upon the presence of a single 'high risk feedback' study (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>), the removal of which substantially reduced the level of heterogeneity amongst the remaining seven studies.</P>
<P>One well conducted large scale negative study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>) did not report outcomes relating to the management of depression. When a test for publication bias was applied to all studies reporting this outcome, a symmetrical plot was obtained and Eggers's test was non-significant (p=0.36).</P>
<P>
<B>3. Effect of screening/case finding on the outcome of depression<BR/>
</B>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>; Whooley* 2000) presented data on the impact of screening/case finding on the short term (0-6 month) outcome of depression. Unfortunately, for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>; Whooley* 2000), depression outcomes were not presented in a form that allowed statistical pooling (no standard deviation or change data rather than endpoint data presented). However, each of these three studies recorded non-significant results (p&lt;0.05). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>) presented dichotomous outcomes for depression (a fall below 'caseness' on the Hamilton Depression rating scale at six month follow-up), which was non-significant (relative risk 1.08; 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 2.40). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>) presented 12 month follow up data, and found no significant difference (between group difference on BDI = zero, 95% confidence interval -3 to +4, p=0.924).</P>
<P>Insufficient data were available to test for publication bias with respect to this outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Other outcomes</B>
<BR/>No study examined the costs and resource use associated with routine case finding/screening. No study examined patients' views about the usefulness or acceptability of standardised instruments for detecting psychiatric disorders.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>Main findings</B>
<BR/>The main findings of this review are that screening/case finding instruments, when routinely administered and fed back, have little impact on the overall recognition rates of depression. Three relatively small size studies did find a positive effect for depression case finding/screening, but these involved a logistical more complex two stage procedure of screening and the selective feedback of positive results for those who score above a certain threshold. The actual management of depression by clinicians was much more variable and there was no clear association between routine case finding/screening and improved management. Lastly, there were very few data on the actual outcomes of depression, but there seemed to be little impact on actual outcomes for depression at six and twelve months. Each of these findings will now be explored in more detail</P>
<P>
<I>1. Effect of screening/case finding on the recognition of depression</I>
<BR/>The finding that routinely administered case finding/screening instruments for depression have little impact on the actual recognition of depression is a robust finding, based upon several large scale and well conducted studies. Where substantial heterogeneity was found to exist between studies, a plausible and significant cause for this heterogeneity was established. Positive studies were almost consistently those which had employed a logistical more complex two stage screening and feedback method - 'high risk feedback'. This positive finding must be tempered by the fact that the positive studies were all of relatively small size - compared to those which employed 'unselected feedback'. A consideration of why 'routine feedback' is ineffective, whilst 'high risk feedback' is possibly effective is discussed below (see - 'clinical implications').</P>
<P>
<I>2. Effect of screening/case finding on management of depression</I>
<BR/>Broadly defined management outcomes ('any intervention for depression') and a specific empirically supported treatment ('prescription of anti-depressants') were not clearly influenced by screening. Studies reporting these outcomes were fewer and of smaller size than those reporting recognition rates. Substantial heterogeneity existed between studies and a ready source of this heterogeneity was not apparent. However, it is worthy of note that several large scale studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>) that had found no effect on recognition rates for depression had not studied or reported on the actual management of depression. The studies that showed a positive effect for the outcome of depression recognition were also those that studied and found a positive effect for management, in terms of outside referral and anti-depressant prescription (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>). Although non-significant, the results of this outcome were also substantially altered the presence of one strongly positive study (<LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>). The impact of screening on the actual management of depression therefore seems to be minimal.</P>
<P>
<I>3. Effect of screening/case finding on the outcome of depression</I>
<BR/>In comparison with the previous two endpoints - clinician recognition and management - the impact of case finding/screening on the actual outcome of depression was rarely reported, and was mostly in a form that precluded meta-analytic pooling. Of those studies that did report this outcome, it is worth of note that all had found a positive effect on clinician management, but each failed to show any significant impact on depression outcome (when p values alone were considered). This is perhaps the most important outcome and no benefit for screening/case finding is shown within this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods of the review</B>
<BR/>
<I>Comparisons with other reviews in this area</I>
<BR/>Traditional (non-systematic) review articles in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Meakin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meakin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1994</LINK>) have produced contradictory recommendations without any clear indication as to how their authors have arrived at their conclusions. The present review, in contrast, produces a series of conclusions with a clear and explicit outline of the methods by which those conclusions were arrived at. This demonstrates the major advantage of systematic reviews over traditional review articles. Other researchers have also sought to apply systematic review methods to establish the effectiveness of screening for depression (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Pignone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignone 2002</LINK> - on behalf of the US Preventative Services Task Force). The results presented in the present Cochrane review are generally less supportive of routine screening/case finding than those of Pignone 2002. Comparisons of the methods and results of both reviews shows the following differences:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The present review is a more up to date summary of the research evidence, with more comprehensive searches and databases;</LI>
<LI>Several studies (based on 2349 patients) were included in the present review, which were not identified or included by Pignone (<LINK REF="STD-German-1987" TYPE="STUDY">German 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weatherall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weatherall 2000</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>Several studies were excluded from the present review which were included by Pignone 2002, as they fell without of our tight inclusion criteria. For example, Pignone 2002 included several large positive studies, which were clearly not randomised and are excluded from the present review (<LINK REF="STD-Johnstone-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Johnstone 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reilfer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reilfer 1996</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Perhaps most importantly, a more heterogenous sample of studies were included by <LINK REF="REF-Pignone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignone 2002</LINK>, including those where screening was embedded within a complex package of patient care and clinician support (quality improvement strategies) (<LINK REF="STD-Katzelnick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Katzelnick 2000</LINK>; Rost 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Wells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 2000</LINK>). Of particular note was the inclusion of a large positive US study - the Partners in Care study (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 2000</LINK>). The components of this strategy included: intensive face to face clinician education; computerised decision support and individualised treatment algorithms; the active support of a nurse case manager; regular consultation-liaison with a specialist mental health clinician (psychologist or psychiatrist). Screening was only one component of this package and the effectiveness of screening/case finding as an active ingredient cannot be assumed or established.</P>
<P>Once again, the use of systematic research methods allows the critical reader to disentangle the reasons behind discordant results from two reviews of apparently similar areas of clinical practice and policy.</P>
<P>
<I>Identification of studies</I>
<BR/>It is possible that further research exists which was not identified within the literature search strategies. Some of this research emerged following the publication of an earlier version of this review in a paper journal (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2001</LINK>), and highlights the advantages of publication in peer reviewed journals in enhancing the quality and comprehensiveness of the review. Similarly, data were left incompletely reported in several studies, but which potentially could have been included in this review. The present review is therefore still likely to be incomplete, but will be published and updated in line with existing and emerging data as reviewed within the Cochrane library. </P>
<P>
<I>Examination of heterogeneity</I>
<BR/>The research included in the present review was subject to a large degree of heterogeneity. This became apparent when the methods and results of individual studies were described in a systematic way. Important sources of heterogeneity anticipated in advance were those relating to the mode of administration and feedback of outcomes measure (the 'unselected' versus 'high risk' approach). The present review illustrates the complementary nature of quantitative and more qualitative approaches to the examination and exploration of sources of heterogeneity. The use of separate statistical pooling for divergent approaches to feedback can be defended on both a statistical and an intuitive basis. The clinical implications of 'unselected' versus 'high risk' feedback are explored in more detail in the following sections.</P>
<P>
<I>Publication bias</I>
<BR/>The present review has highlighted two problems in the examination of the influence of publication bias: the difficulty in applying tests for publication bias, and the difficulty in interpreting the tests that are used.</P>
<P>All published forms of research are potentially subject to publication bias, and there are reasons why psychiatric research is likely to be just as susceptible as research in other areas and specialities (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003b</LINK>). Conventional tests for publication bias, such as the funnel plot, rely upon two criteria being satisfied: First, studies must be sufficiently similar in terms of participants and interventions to justify a formal statistical pooling in the form of a meta-analysis. Secondly, the published literature must include a sufficient number of studies with a wide range of sample sizes, providing a mix of smaller studies and one or more larger studies with which to construct a funnel plot. </P>
<P>When applying this method of analysis to the group of studies that included the detection of mood disorders as an outcome following feedback, then the second criterion was fulfilled, with a range of study sizes between 80 and 2203. However, for reasons outlined previously, there was felt to be substantial heterogeneity between studies. When a funnel plot was applied, the asymmetrical plot that was obtained was likely to be a reflection of underlying heterogeneity, where this was also a function of sample size. <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK> urges caution in making the assumption that asymmetrical funnel plots are only indicative of publication bias, and the present review provides an interesting example of this. <LINK REF="REF-Petticrew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petticrew 1999</LINK> have also demonstrated the potential for heterogeneity to produce asymmetrical funnel plots, where differences in effect size were related to the underlying quality of observational research in the area of heart disease. </P>
<P>
<B>Implications for clinical practice</B>
<BR/>It is perhaps surprising that the uniform administration of well validated case finding instruments, such as the GHQ, with sensitivities and specificities of over 70 and 90% respectively in their ability to detect psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1988</LINK>), has not been found to substantially influence actual clinician behaviour. Routine case finding only becomes effective in increasing the rate of recognition of emotional disorders when there is some form of screening procedure, whereby an instrument is administered, scored by someone other than the clinician, and only those with high scores have their results fed back to the clinician (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Callahan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Callahan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magruder_x002d_Habib-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magruder-Habib 1990</LINK>). Routine administration combined with selective feedback is, however, unlikely to form a model for routine practice, nor does it reflect current UK practice, since this strategy is likely to require that an additional person be employed in order to administer score and feedback outcome measures to the clinician.</P>
<P>There are a number of possible explanations for the observed result. The most likely explanation is the relationship between psychometrics and clinical decision making. It is predictive value (rather than sensitivity and specificity) which is of most interest to clinicians in the context of routine care - i.e. the proportion of those predicted by the test as having the disease who turn out to have the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1991</LINK>). Crucially, positive predictive value increases according to the prevalence of a disorder in the population tested. Whilst unrecognised emotional disorders form a significant portion of the clinical caseload in non-psychiatric services, this is rarely going to exceed 15%. The consequence is that of those patients with a positive screening result, only 50% will turn out to actually have an emotional disorder (i.e. be 'true positives') (<LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 1984</LINK>). Equally, the workload and outside referral rate is likely to rise dramatically if all positive test results are acted upon when positive predictive value is much lower than quoted sensitivities and specificities. Clinicians may intuitively recognise this fact and will be unwilling to act on positive test results (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>A major limitation of the research presented in this review is the fact that case definition of depression is generally based upon a questionnaire score above a certain cut off point, rather than some 'gold standard', such as a standardised research interview. Thus, the principle trial endpoint - rates of recognition of emotional disorders - uses this imperfect form of case definition. Research shows that questionnaires consistently overestimate the true prevalence of clinically important emotional disorders (i.e. those worthy of intervention) - e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1987</LINK>. It should perhaps therefore be less surprising that clinicians in this review uniformly ascribed far fewer patients as having emotional problems than did questionnaires. However, the negative result for feedback suggests that questionnaire results, in effect, add little to the clinical encounter. Calls for the routine application of such questionnaires in non-psychiatric settings (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1994</LINK>) are therefore not supported.</P>
<P>A second explanation is that non-psychiatrists do not feel best equipped to deal with emotional disorders, even when these are uncovered using screening questionnaires. Screening is therefore a necessary, but not sufficient, condition in facilitating the appropriate management of these psychological problems. Supporting this conclusion is the observation from other systematic reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003a</LINK>) that feedback is most effective when it is accompanied by an educational programme and the provision of a dedicated outside referral agency who will readily assume responsibility for management (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1989</LINK>). The results of the present review also complement recent research which shows that simple educational interventions, such as the provision of guidelines on the detection and management of depression in primary care have little impact (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Implications for health policy</B>
<BR/>Screening tests can only be justified if the instrument is: (i) accurate; (ii) results in a more effective treatment than would otherwise be the case and; (iii) does so with a favourable ratio of costs to benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mant-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mant 1990</LINK>). The accuracy of an instrument is traditionally determined by the examination of sensitivity, specificity and predictive value (<LINK REF="REF-Knottnerus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knottnerus 2002</LINK>). Several of the authors of studies in this review justified their choice of instrument with reference to sensitivity and specificity as determined in prior validation studies. Only one examined or published these key psychometric properties within the populations that were recruited or randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1999</LINK>). However, it is predictive value which is of most interest to clinicians in the context of routine care - i.e. the proportion of those predicted by the test as having the disease who turn out to have the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1991</LINK>). Predictive value increases as the incidence of disease in the population under investigation increases and this is essentially what is happening when the instrument is administered to all patients and only those with positive score have their results 'fed back'. This is a likely explanation of the improved recognition by clinicians when feedback occurs with only 'high risk' patients as opposed to feedback with all patients. Further research might seek to evaluate the routine use of outcome measures using basic psychometric criteria such as sensitivity, specificity and predictive value.</P>
<P>The second criterion which must be fulfilled for a screening instrument is that its use should result in effective treatment. The evidence outlined in the present review shows that this is under researched, and the research that has been published reflects a positive subsamples of the existing studies. Even when routine feedback does change clinical management, a general finding was that there was no subsequent improvement in clinical outcome (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Dowrick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dowrick 1995</LINK>). The last criterion to be satisfied is that the benefits of screening should outweigh cost. Cost can include the costs (monetary, time and forgone opportunity) incurred through the introduction of routine outcome measurement, and no studies in this review measured this. Additionally, cost involves the harm which might be done through routine outcome measurement in terms of the initiation of treatment for those wrongly identified as having some psychological disorder ('false positives'), or the initiation of resource intensive referral or intervention for those who might be identified as having some emotional problem, but which might be self limiting. Further research is needed in all these respects and in the absence of such research, then it would be imprudent to recommend the introduction of routine outcome measurement in routine care settings.</P>
<P>One substantial policy initiative in recent years has been the development, evaluation and implementation of enhanced models of care for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 2001</LINK>). Enhanced models of care, such as 'collaborative care', are generally effective (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003a</LINK>). Several trials of enhanced care include screening strategies (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Katzelnick-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Katzelnick 2000</LINK>). The degree to which screening is a necessary or active ingredient in enhancing the impact of these strategies is not addressed by the current review. It remains possible, as has been advanced by the US Preventative Services Task Force, that 'larger benefits have been observed in studies in which the communication of screening results is coordinated with effective follow up and treatment' (<LINK REF="REF-Pignone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignone 2002</LINK>). To our knowledge, no studies have compared enhanced packages of care (including screening) with enhanced packages of care (without screening), and we cannot use the results of this review to comment on this assertion. A related Cochrane review addressing this question is currently in preparation. Unfortunately, influential policy guidelines such as those produced in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>) have taken this assertion to mean that screening - by its self - can be an effective strategy to improve the quality and outcome of care. The results of our review can clearly be used to refute the superficial appeal of screening strategies - alone - in improving the outcomes of depression. </P>
<P>
<B>Implications for research</B>
<BR/>Further studies into the impact of routine case finding/screening instruments for depression may be justified; including the potentially effective 'high risk strategy' versus 'routine feedback'. Such studies should examine the impact on clinician management and longer term outcome of depression. There remains a need to understand the role of routinely administered instruments in clinical care and decision making. Qualitative research, conducted within the context a randomised trial will help us understand how and why this approach is either used or ignored by clinicians. The cost effectiveness of routine case finding/screening should also be established using a concurrent economic evaluation within a randomised trial. Cluster randomisation rather than individual randomisation should be the gold standard method of research for this and other strategies designed to influence clinician behaviour, but this has rarely been employed.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is substantial evidence that routinely administered case finding/screening questionnaires for depression have little or no impact on the detection and management of depression by clinicians. Practice guidelines and recommendations to adopt this strategy in isolation in order to improve the quality of healthcare should be resisted.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The longer term benefits and costs of routine screening/case finding for depression have not been evaluated. A two stage procedure for screening/case finding may be effective, but this needs to be evaluated in a large scale cluster randomised trial, with a prospective economic evaluation. Further research is need to assess whether screening enhances the effectiveness of approaches such as 'case management'.</P>
