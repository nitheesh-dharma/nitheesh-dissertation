<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>How effective is giving a combination of haloperidol and promethazine for calming people who are aggresssive due to psychosis?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Emergency psychiatric services are often required to help calm people who are aggressive because they are experiencing distressing psychoses. In such situations quick-acting medication is usually given. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic typically used to treat schizophrenia, and promethazine is a strong tranquilliser that can help to reduce nervous tension.</P>
<P>
<B>Searches</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register on 6 May 2015 for randomised controlled trials that compared the use of haloperidol and promethazine with other drugs for the treatment of psychosis-induced aggression.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found six trials that randomised 1367 participants to receive haloperidol plus promethazine or either haloperidol, midazolam, lorazepam, olanzapine, ziprasidone, or a combination of haloperidol plus midazolam.</P>
<P>Haloperidol plus promethazine effectively manages aggressive behaviour swiftly and safely, and is more effective after 30 minutes than haloperidol on its own.</P>
<P>Midazolam has a sedative effect and reduces anxiety, and was shown to be more effective in offering swift sedation than haloperidol plus promethazine. However, the risk of serious side effects when taking midazolam (in particular breathing problems) should be noted.</P>
<P>Haloperidol plus midazolam had a greater sedative effect than haloperidol plus promethazine. Haloperidol and midazolam didn't make people feel excessively sleepy and reduced the need for restraints or seclusion.</P>
<P>Haloperidol plus promethazine had a greater sedative effect than lorazepam (which is typically used to treat anxiety). There was no difference in the number of people requiring restraints or seclusion.</P>
<P>Olanzapine offered effective sedation but had a higher risk of making people feel excessively sleepy.</P>
<P>The results comparing haloperidol plus promethazine with the antipsychotic ziprasidone were unclear and of low quality.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was high. The data provided demonstrate that a haloperidol plus promethazine is effective and safe for use in situations where people are aggressive due to psychoses.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On 6 May 2015 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials, which is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-01 11:29:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised clinical trials with useable data focusing on haloperidol plus promethazine for psychosis-induced aggression.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-20 12:49:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the 2015 update searching. The review now includes six studies, randomising 1367 participants and presenting data relevant to six comparisons.</P>
<P>When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with haloperidol alone for psychosis-induced aggression for the outcome not tranquil or asleep at 30 minutes, the combination treatment was clearly more effective (n=316, 1 RCT, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87, high-quality evidence). There were 10 occurrences of acute dystonia in the haloperidol alone arm and none in the combination group. The trial was stopped early as haloperidol alone was considered to be too toxic.</P>
<P>When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with olanzapine, high-quality data showed both approaches to be tranquillising. It was suggested that the combination of haloperidol plus promethazine was more effective, but the difference between the two approaches did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.61, high-quality evidence). Lower-quality data suggested that the risk of unwanted excessive sedation was less with the combination approach (n=116, 2 RCTs, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.84).</P>
<P>When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with ziprasidone all data were of lesser quality. We identified no binary data for the outcome tranquil or asleep. The average sedation score (Ramsay Sedation Scale) was lower for the combination approach but not to conventional levels of statistical significance (n=60, 1 RCT, MD -0.1, 95% CI - 0.58 to 0.38). These data were of low quality and it is unclear what they mean in clinical terms. The haloperidol plus promethazine combination appeared to cause less excessive sedation but again the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=111, 2 RCTs, RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.43).</P>
<P>We found few data for the comparison of haloperidol plus promethazine versus haloperidol plus midazolam. Average Ramsay Sedation Scale scores suggest the combination of haloperidol plus midazolam to be the most sedating (n=60, 1 RCT, MD - 0.6, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.07, low-quality evidence). The risk of excessive sedation was considerably less with haloperidol plus promethazine (n=117, 2 RCTs, RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49, low-quality evidence). Haloperidol plus promethazine seemed to decrease the risk of needing restraints by around 12 hours (n=60, 1 RCT, RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.55, low-quality evidence). It may be that use of midazolam with haloperidol sedates swiftly, but this effect does not last long.</P>
<P>When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with lorazepam, haloperidol plus promethazine seemed to more effectively cause sedation or tranquillisation by 30 minutes (n=200, 1 RCT, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.68, high-quality evidence). The secondary outcome of needing restraints or seclusion by 12 hours was not clearly different between groups, with about 10% in each group needing this intrusive intervention (moderate-quality evidence). Sedation data were not reported, however, the combination group did have less 'any serious adverse event' in 24-hour follow-up, but there were not clear differences between the groups and we are unsure exactly what the adverse effect was. There were no deaths.</P>
<P>When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with midazolam, there was clear evidence that midazolam is more swiftly tranquillising of an aggressive situation than haloperidol plus promethazine (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.8, high-quality evidence). On its own, midazolam seems to be swift and effective in tranquillising people who are aggressive due to psychosis. There was no difference in risk of serious adverse event overall (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.95, high-quality evidence). However, 1 in 150 participants allocated haloperidol plus promethazine had a swiftly reversed seizure, and 1 in 151 given midazolam had swiftly reversed respiratory arrest.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Haloperidol plus promethazine is effective and safe, and its use is based on good evidence. Benzodiazepines work, with midazolam being particularly swift, but both midazolam and lorazepam cause respiratory depression. Olanzapine intramuscular and ziprasidone intramuscular do seem to be viable options and their action is swift, but resumption of aggression with subsequent need to re-inject was more likely than with haloperidol plus promethazine. Haloperidol used on its own without something to offset its frequent and serious adverse effects does seem difficult to justify.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most people live in low- or middle-income countries, and rates of severe mental illnesses are consistent across the world (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>). As there is no evidence that the prevalence of psychiatric emergencies differs across the globe, it follows that most episodes of aggression in severely mentally ill people must take place in these lower-income countries. Although new preparations of atypical antipsychotic drugs may be available for use in the acute emergency, these drugs are expensive and are unlikely to be commonplace for the majority of people in need of emergency tranquillisation in the near future.</P>
<P>Health services often manage agitated or violent people, and such behaviour is particularly prevalent for emergency psychiatric services (10%) (<LINK REF="REF-McAllister-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAllister 2002</LINK>). Most incidents in the psychiatric setting are secondary to severe illnesses such as schizophrenia or substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>). Guidelines recommend that patients should be calmed by use of words and reassurance, a diagnostic history acquired, and physical and laboratory tests completed before starting any pharmacological treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Expert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Expert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCPsych-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCPsych 1998</LINK>). The acute danger of the situation often makes this impossible, and emergency room staff work in circumstances where histories may be short and fragmented, diagnoses speculative, and physical examination impossible. Nevertheless, clinicians have a responsibility to ensure the safety of everyone involved, and so rapid pharmacological tranquillisation of aggressive/violent patients may be unavoidable.</P>
<P>The drugs used in this situation should ensure that the person becomes calm safely and swiftly. However, guidelines are usually statements of consensus and differ on which drugs to use (<LINK REF="REF-Expert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Expert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCPsych-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCPsych 1998</LINK>). Surveys also show variation in clinicians' preferred drug treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Binder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cunnane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunnane 1994</LINK>), which is confirmed by audit (<LINK REF="REF-Moritz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moritz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilowsky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilowsky 1992</LINK>), although the broad class of the older-generation antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, or both are most frequently used (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McAllister-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAllister 2002</LINK>). The combination haloperidol plus promethazine is used commonly and consistently in Brazil (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002a</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and India (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2003</LINK>). This medication combination is inexpensive, and each drug is on the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Drugs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK> updated guidance now recommends the combination as one possible approach.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As has already been stated in this review's sibling (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2013</LINK>), haloperidol was developed in the late 1950s for use in the field of anaesthesia and was initially used to prevent surgical shock (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Research subsequently demonstrated beneficial effect on hallucinations, delusions, aggressiveness, impulsiveness, and states of excitement (<LINK REF="REF-Ayd-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayd 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ayd-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayd 1978</LINK>). These findings led to the introduction of haloperidol as an antipsychotic. However, haloperidol has many adverse effects, particularly problematic of which, when used in the acute situation, are the acute dystonias. These are intermittent spasmodic or sustained involuntary contractions of muscles all over the body including the face, neck, trunk, pelvis, extremities, and even the larynx. While not often life-threatening, they are most distressing. Opisthotonus is one such dystonia resulting in an out-of-control arching of the head, neck, and spinal column that is particularly dramatic and unpleasant and frightening to the patient. The prevalence of this adverse effect is not clear, but we are aware that <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK> was stopped early because haloperidol alone was thought to cause dystonias too often for continuation of the the trial to be ethical. The acute dystonias are successfully and swiftly treated with use of anticholinergic medication.</P>
<P>Promethazine is a phenothiazine. It is thought to be antipsychotic in itself - although weakly so compared with others - but has strong antihistamine and moderately potent anticholinergic properties (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Promethazine is known to be sedating, which is likely due to its antihistaminic properties.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although widely used in situations where a person is acutely aggressive thought to be due to psychotic illness, haloperidol given parenterally does have important adverse effects. It is also not particularly sedating in itself (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2013</LINK>). However, it is a potent antipsychotic drug. The combination of both drugs is theoretically attractive. Promethazine could conceivably introduce often-welcome sedation in the acute situation whilst offsetting any acute dystonic reaction through its anticholinergic effects.</P>
<P>We are unclear of the history of the combination of the two drugs. We have been told that it was a common practice in British psychiatry decades ago but have no reference to corroborate this. It is, however, used in Brazil, <LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002a</LINK>, and India, <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2003</LINK>, and now, with support of <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>, it may become more prevalent in the UK.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>
<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument was not written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.<BR/>
<BR/>Ideally the measuring instrument should either be i. a self report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; we noted in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> if this was the case or not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Both endpoint and change data have advantages. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and hard-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis, as we preferred to use mean differences rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion.<BR/>
</P>
<P>(Note that we entered data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis irrespective of the following rules, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data, as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.)</P>
<P>For endpoint data N &lt; 200:</P>
<P>a. when a scale starts from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew, and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether its inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2, we included these data, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>);</P>
<P>b. if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), which can have values from 30 to 210) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S - S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>Where relevant, to facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week, or per month) to a common metric.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cutoff points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), in <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>, or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this can be considered to be a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). Where data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cutoff presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for haloperidol plus promethazine. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (for example 'Not un-improved'), we presented data where the left of the line indicated an unfavourable outcome and noted this in the relevant graphs.</P>

<P>Review author PG independently assessed risk of bias within the included studies found in the update search by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>to assess trial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow, and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Had we found cluster studies, where clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. If in subsequent versions of this review we find cluster studies, we will attempt to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients for their clustered data and adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported, we will assume it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies will be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect, which occurs if an effect (for example pharmacological, physiological, or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data from the first phase of any cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formulae in Section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)<I>.</I> We did not use data where the additional treatment arms were not relevant.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not use them within analyses. However, if more than 50% of data in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table/s by down-rating quality.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0 and 50% and where data were not clearly described, we presented such data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). We assumed all those leaving the study early to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, except for the outcomes of death and adverse effects, for which we used the rate of those who stayed in the study (in that particular arm of the trial) for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis testing how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who completed the study to that point were compared to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If SDs were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If these were not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P value or t value available for differences in mean, we calculated SDs according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the standard error (SE) is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Sections 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges, or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method that is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>

Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple-imputation or mixed effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches (for example MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if no ITT data were available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item 'incomplete outcome data' of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Chapter 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar size. In future versions of this review, if funnel plots are possible, we will seek statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us, and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. However, there is a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses.</P>

<P>This review now includes six randomised studies.</P>
<P>As four studies were undertaken by authors of this review, objectivity is difficult. The TREC studies (TREC=Tranquilização Rápida-Ensaio Clínico, translation: Rapid Tranquillisation-Clinical Trial) were undertaken in response to clinical need for good evidence, the first in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the second in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. A preliminary survey in the psychiatric emergency rooms of Rio found haloperidol plus promethazine to be the drug combination of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002a</LINK>). Midazolam, a benzodiazepine, was another option. Trialists worked in conjunction with the clinicians of these emergency rooms to design a randomised trial which was then published and followed (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002b</LINK>). Psychiatrists in Vellore, Southern India also use haloperidol plus promethazine, but use lorazepam and, more latterly, olanzapine as an alternative. They essentially used the same protocol for their work. Also in Rio the original protocol, <LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002b</LINK>, was reused in a new trial comparing the benchmark haloperidol plus promethazine with haloperidol alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Length of trials</HEADING>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK> trials included any person for whom rapid tranquillisation was being considered in the psychiatric emergency rooms of a very large city. Over two-thirds of participants suffered from psychosis. In <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-II</LINK> trials, only around 16% of participants had schizophrenia, but nearly half had mania; substance misuse was less prevalent. The <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-II</LINK> trials employed diagnostic criteria (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision); <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK> did not.

The two new studies were very similar (<LINK REF="STD-Baldacara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Baldacara 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 2013</LINK>), also focussing on people who were very disturbed and agitated whose condition was thought to be due to psychosis. The <LINK REF="STD-Baldacara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Baldacara 2011</LINK> study, similar to the four TREC studies, involved people who were determined to likely have psychosis (60%), with the other 40% likely to be agitated as a result of a manic episode as part of bipolar disorder. In <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 2013</LINK>, there were more participants with bipolar disorder and other less clear causes of the agitation. Overall the majority of participants were designated as severely agitated or worse and average age was around the early to mid-30s.</P>

Having the advantage of a common protocol, all TREC studies recorded other episodes of aggression; use of additional medication; use of restraints or seclusion; needing extra visits from the doctor; refusing oral medication; hospital discharge; serious adverse effects; and leaving the study early. However, <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-II</LINK> also used the scales listed below for some outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.1 Outcome scales</HEADING>
<P>a. Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) (<LINK REF="REF-Breier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breier 2002</LINK>)<BR/>The ACES is a single-item rating scale developed by Eli Lilly and Company. On this scale, 1=marked agitation, 4=normal, 9=unable to be aroused.</P>
<P>b. Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>Akathisia is a distressing subjective experience of restlessness associated with restless movements that may occur after commencing antipsychotic medication. The BAS includes an objective and a subjective component and a global impression rating for akathisia; these are rated on a scale of 0 to 3 for the objective and subjective items and 0 to 5 for the global clinical assessment.</P>
<P>c. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI Scale) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>One of the most widely used brief assessment tools in psychiatry, the CGI Scale assesses both severity of illness and clinical improvement by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. The scale includes three items: the first two rate severity of illness and global improvement on a seven-point scoring system, with low scores showing decreased severity or overall improvement, respectively, and the less frequently used third item assesses therapeutic response, which is rated as a combination of therapeutic effectiveness and adverse events. Each item is scored separately.</P>
<P>d. Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Yudofsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yudofsky 1986</LINK>)<BR/>The OAS is a 16-item rating scale used to measure the intensity of verbal and physical aggression. Clinicians comment on the duration of the aggressive incident as well as the intervention required to control it. High scores are indicative of higher levels of aggression.</P>
<P>e. Overt Agitation Severity Scale (OASS) (<LINK REF="REF-Yudofsky-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yudofsky 1997</LINK>)<BR/>The OASS is designed to define and objectively rate the severity of agitated behaviour. Its rating is confined exclusively to observable behavioural manifestations of agitation, which comprise three categories: vocalisations and oral/facial movements; upper torso and upper extremity movements; and lower extremity movements. Under each of these categories four types of agitated behaviour are listed, which are rated on a 0 to 4 point scale, with 0=not present and 4=always present.

<P>f. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Excited Component (PANSS-EC) (<LINK REF="REF-Montoya-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montoya 2011</LINK>)<BR/>The PANSS-EC is a five-item scale (excitement, tension, hostility, unco-operativeness, and poor impulse control). The items are rated from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). Scores range from 5 to 35, with mean scores &#8805; 20 indicating agitation. A high score indicates high levels of agitation.</P>
<P>g. Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1974</LINK>)<BR/>The RSS is a six-item rating scale used to assess levels of sedation by selecting the most appropriate level of response. A rating of 1 indicates an agitated, anxious state; a rating of 6 indicates an unresponsive state.</P>
<P>h. Simpson-Angus Scale - Hillside/Long Island Jewish Hospital modification (SAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This SAS is a 10-item scale used to evaluate the presence and severity of drug-induced parkinsonian symptomatology. The 10 items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a scale of 0 to 4. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-I</LINK> trial also involved randomisation codes being generated, away from the site, from a table of random numbers, and the allocation sequence being supplied to colleagues who designed the serially numbered intervention packs completely independently from those administering the treatments or recording the outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-II</LINK> generated the allocation sequences using a free online system (<A HREF="http://www.randomization.com/">www.randomization.com/</A>) but employed the same technique to conceal allocation.

<P>All TREC studies were blind only until the point of treatment assignment to minimise selection bias. In <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-I</LINK>, all ratings were not blind, and in <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-I</LINK>, ratings for the first two hours were not blind, as management teams needed to know the prescribed medications. In both Indian studies, however, the study co-ordinators were blind and undertook ratings at 240 minutes. At this time, they also guessed the allocated intervention to assess their blinding. In any event, the TREC studies were designed to evaluate real-world interventions that are not routinely given blind. In <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-I</LINK>, a medical student ("Dr Stopwatch"), blinded to group allocation, accurately recorded the time from injection to when they felt the person to be tranquil or asleep. This blinded rating concurred with that of the unblinded assessment, suggesting that, at least for these outcomes, blinding may not be necessary. The <LINK REF="STD-Baldacara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Baldacara 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 2013</LINK> studies are both described as blinded, but they do not say how successful this was.

<P>Overall reporting bias is unclear across the majority of included trials. It should be noted that the review authors who extracted data from 2004 and 2008 searches (GH, JA, NR) were also trialists involved in the trials found in these searches. However, other observers have noted the TREC trials to be the most methodologically rigorous randomised trials of aggressive people with mental health problems (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). The data are also avaiable in full for re-analysis. The two new studies found in the 2015 search were extracted by a different review author (PG). <LINK REF="STD-Baldacara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Baldacara 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 2013</LINK> do mirror the TREC trials and, although using scale-derived data more than the original studies, reporting seemed to be clear and largely complete.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Tranquil or asleep: Not tranquil or asleep - by 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome of this review and that of the single trial contributing to this result was 'tranquil/asleep'. We found high-quality evidence that the combination of haloperidol and promethazine is more effective than the use of haloperidol alone (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>For adverse effects there was no difference in risk of seizure and no deaths. However, in about 150 per group of allocation there were 10 occurrences of acute dystonia in the haloperidol-alone arm and none in the group given haloperidol plus promethazine (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.76). Acute dystonia is most unpleasant, and it was for this reason that the study was stopped early, as the Steering Group of this trial felt that it was unethical to continue with the haloperidol alone (<LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK>). Haloperidol alone has been used for decades in the acute clinical situation. In the context of a randomised trial where adverse effects are scrutinised and more people are being monitored centrally than usual, the properties of a treatment can be properly estimated. We therefore agree with the Steering Group of <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK> that there are better treatments available than the unprotected use of this toxic drug. The combination of haloperidol and promethazine seems to be one such better treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.3 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All other outcomes were less convincing, but overall favour the combination of haloperidol and promethazine when compared with haloperidol alone. The risk of another episode of aggression (by 24 hours) was somewhat reduced (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.68 to 2.01), but data were few and of low quality. The risk of 'not being discharged by 2 weeks' was also reduced, but not to conventional levels of statistical significance (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07, high-quality evidence). Although difficult to interpret from a clinical perspective, the average OAS aggression scores favoured the combination of haloperidol and promethazine (MD -1.8 95% CI -1.93 to -1.67), but the data were of low quality. We have no economic data to analyse, but both haloperidol and promethazine are low-cost treatments that may reduce the time spent in hospital, and can therefore be suggested to provide in combination the most cost-effective treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Tranquil or asleep: Not tranquil or asleep - by 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>Although the evidence suggested that the combination of haloperidol and promethazine was more effective, the difference between the two approaches did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.61). We found high-quality data that both approaches are tranquillising.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Global state: Needing restraints or seclusion</HEADING>
<P>By 12 hours fewer participants allocated to olanzapine had another episode of aggression necessitating restraints or seclusion but this difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=60, 1 RCT, RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 40.28). These low-quality data do fit with other outcomes such as 'requiring additional drugs during initial phase' (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.74), 'being restrained by 4 hours' (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14), and 'no global improvement by 4 hours' (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01) - data for these outcomes do tend to favour the haloperidol plus promethazine combination but some do not reach conventional levels of statistical significance and all results are from small trials. This work does merit reinvestigation in new trials. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Adverse effects</HEADING>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There seemed to be no clear difference in the numbers of people discharged from hospital at two-week follow-up (high-quality data). There were no deaths. Aggression scores were lower for the he combination approach, but the clinical meaning of these scores is not clear. There were no economic analyses, but olanzapine intramuscular is a much more expensive treatment than the combination approach and seems to be less effective.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Tranquil or asleep: Average sedation score (RSS) - by 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>We identified no binary data. The average sedation score (RSS) was lower for the combination approach, although not to conventional levels of statistical significance (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.38). These data were of low quality, and the meaning of these findings in clinical terms is unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Global state: Needing restraints or seclusion - by up to 12 hours</HEADING>
<P>Fewer participants receiving the combination treatment needed restraints or seclusion in the hours following the aggressive index incident, but there was not a clear difference between the groups (n=60, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.29, moderate-quality evidence). The average aggression score (OAS) initially favoured ziprasidone, but after 12 hours the results favoured the combination treatment (MD -1.6, 95% CI -1.75 to -1.45, moderate-quality evidence). This may fit with the increased risk of excessive sedation with ziprasidone - an early effect that then disappears.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Both new trials contributed to the outcome 'excessive sedation' (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.43). It appears that ziprasidone may be effective but less desirable than the combination treatment of haloperidol plus promethazine, although the total numbers were small (n=110), and data were of low quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No one died in these short, small trials. We have no data on service outcomes such as 'discharged'. There was no economic data or consideration of outcomes. Ziprasidone intramuscular is an expensive treatment compared with haloperidol plus promethazine.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.1 Tranquil or asleep: Average sedation score (RSS) - by 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes for this review were binary, but we have only the proxy measure of average score for sedation (RSS). Low-quality data from one small trial (n=60) suggest haloperidol plus midazolam to be more sedating by one hour (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.07). The risk of excessive sedation was considerably less with haloperidol plus promethazine (n=112, 2 RCTs, RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.47, low-quality evidence). These findings would fit with the better-quality data of the comparison haloperidol plus promethazine versus midazolam alone (Comparison 6). Midazolam seems to be a highly sedating, swift-acting intervention. The OAS average aggression scores (including changes during the 12-hour follow-up) are also in keeping with this impression. Combining midazolam with haloperidol does not seem to add - or subtract - much.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.2 Global state: Needing restraints or seclusion - by 12 hours</HEADING>
<P>Low-quality data from one small trial suggests that the combination of haloperidol plus promethazine reduces the need for restraints or seclusion (n=60, RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.55). It may be that use of midazolam - in this case with the addition of haloperidol - swiftly sedates, but the effects do not last over a longer period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.3 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were no deaths in the short, small trial providing data for this outcome. Follow-up was for a matter of hours, so service outcomes such as 'not discharged' were not relevant. We do not know the effects of haloperidol plus midazolam in the longer term. There were no economic data. Both combinations are inexpensive, but the differences in outcomes complex. Costing of short, deep sedation with the possibility of resumption of the aggressive incident (haloperidol plus midazolam) compared to treatments providing slower sedative effects that last longer (haloperidol plus promethazine) has not been undertaken.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.1 Tranquil or asleep: Not tranquil or asleep - by 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>The combination of haloperidol plus promethazine seems to cause sedation or tranquillisation more effectively than lorazepam (n=200, 1 RCT, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.68, high-quality evidence). The secondary outcome of needing restraints or seclusion by 12 hours was not clearly different between groups, with about 10% needing this intrusive intervention in each group (moderate-quality evidence). Unlike for other comparisons, we have no aggression scores, but in any event, such data are often problematic and almost impossible to interpret from a clinical perspective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The group administered haloperidol plus promethazine had fewer 'any serious adverse event' during the 24-hour follow-up, but there are no clear differences between the groups, and we were unable to determine exactly what the adverse effect was. There were no deaths.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.3 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We found good data for two-week follow-up for service outcomes. There was no clear difference between groups; around half were discharged from both groups. There were no economic data. Haloperidol plus promethazine is a highly accessible, inexpensive combination. Lorazepam is more expensive and not heat stable, so it must be stored in cool conditions. This may be crudest of economic considerations, but in the absence of anything better, does suggest that lorazepam is likely to be the more expensive of the two approaches.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.1 Tranquil or asleep: Not tranquil or asleep - by 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>We found clear evidence that midazolam is more swiftly tranquillising of an aggressive situation than haloperidol plus promethazine (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.8, high-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the risk of needing restraints or seclusion by around 12 hours, nor in the resumption of aggressive behaviour during the same period. On its own, midazolam seems to be swift and effective in terms of tranquillising difficult aggressive situations thought to be due to psychotic illness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>As there was one serious adverse event in each group of around 150 people, there was no difference in risk overall (n=301, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.95). However, the devil is in the details - and this is where being authors of this review as well as being involved in some of the original and included trials could - while potentially biasing our report - also help. Our careful reading of the reports found detail lost in the reviewing process. One person in the group allocated to the combination of haloperidol plus promethazine had a major epileptic seizure. This was quickly brought under control. One person allocated to midazolam had profound respiratory depression - again quickly reversed by use of flumazenil. We believe that mental health services would tend to be more comfortable and safe managing seizures than respiratory depression. There were no deaths.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.3 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference in recurrence of aggression at 12 hours. By two weeks, there was no clear difference between the groups for service outcomes (not discharged). There were no economic data.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:35:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>Before 2003 there were no trials of this widely used combination treatment for aggression thought to be caused by psychotic illness. There are now trials involving 1367 people with excellent follow-up. This makes haloperidol plus promethazine the most evaluated treatment for people in this extreme situation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>That there are many comparisons is understandable, as there are many choices open to clinicians and few supported by robust evidence. We suggest that the question regarding haloperidol plus promethazine versus haloperidol alone is largely closed. The latter is too toxic, and this toxicity was well-illustrated by the trial.</P>
<P>Data for the comparison with midazolam is also convincing, and further trials would be difficult to justify in light of the existing evidence. The comparison with haloperidol plus midazolam seems entirely to reflect that of that of the comparison with midazolam alone; adding haloperidol seems to offer little benefit. The comparison with lorazepam could perhaps be re-undertaken to supplement the data presented in this review. The use of lorazepam is certainly grossly under-researched (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powney-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powney 2012</LINK>), considering the prevalence of its use. More information could be gained by further comparisons with olanzapine and ziprasidone, but a pattern does seem to be emerging that the newer compounds are swiftly effective, result in fast sedation, but also resumption of the aggression, whereas haloperidol plus promethazine calms the situation more gently and over a longer period of time.</P>
<P>The ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_III" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-III</LINK>), comparing haloperidol plus promethazine with zuclopenthixol acetate, will add important information to this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We found no clear data on satisfaction of the patient or carers with the outcomes of treatment after the episode was over. There were no proper economic outcomes. Many of the outcomes for which there were data remain limited in their value. Certainly the rating scales have added little to this area in which clear binary outcomes are available, easy to record, and clinically meaningful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>These studies were undertaken in largely poor, very busy hospitals of Brazil (middle-income country) and India (low-income country). Resource in these settings is very different to healthcare services of high-income countries. However, we suggest that the patient groups experiencing aggression and the service provided at the acute point of care do not differ to richer countries. In India the body mass may be, on average, lower than in many other countries, and drug doses used may not be fully applicable to situations where people are larger, on average. Both countries use restraints as a possible addition to use of the medications, although Brazil is testing whether less restrictive options are a viable replacement for restraints (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huf-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2012</LINK>). It is possible that the lower doses used, especially in the <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 2013</LINK> trial, may not be as applicable in situations where restraints are less prevalent.</P>

The more recent TREC studies, <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Rio_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Rio-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TREC_x002d_Vellore_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">TREC-Vellore-II</LINK>, differ only to the original trials in their interventions.

<P>For more information please see the 'Summary of findings' tables. Our overall impression was that, unusually, this review contains much data of high quality - but also some of the more familiar lower level of excellence. However, for the most partdata were collected in an understandable way, reported reasonably clearly, and about which we can draw some clinically meaningful conclusions.</P>

<P>We are aware that we invested considerable time and effort in the conduct of some of the trials relevant to this review. We do think that our knowledge helped the review (for example <LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK> Section 6.2), but it could also have biased our appraisal of the literature. We have tried to work only with published reports and make all data extraction and analyses open to scrutiny. We tried repeatedly to contact the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Srinath-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Srinath 2010</LINK>, as this study seemed to meet all inclusion criteria apart from reporting any useable data.</P>

It splits each comparison, where in previous versions all were lumped together. We felt uncomfortable with this initial combination of all data, and the heterogeneity of the findings at the time reinforced this discomfort. Lorazepam and midazolam are both benzodiazepines but are very different in their pharmacology. We are happier with this version where data are presented and commented upon separately.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia and their families</HEADING>
<P>People with schizophrenia and their families should be confident that if the person with mental illness becomes aggressive and out of control, they will swiftly receive effective and safe treatment.</P>
<P>Haloperidol plus promethazine seems an excellent combination to help manage acute aggression with few adverse effects in the very short term. Anyone given haloperidol in these difficult circumstances is at risk of seizure (about 1 in 100 to 150), but adding promethazine greatly offsets the risk of other distressing effects. It also helps swiftly calm the dangerous situation. The combination has a fast onset of action with the majority of episodes of aggression over safely within 30 minutes of it being administered. Re-escalation of the aggression seems less common than with other options.</P>
<P>Compared with haloperidol plus promethazine, midazolam has an even faster onset of action, and, with close supervision, should be safe. The drug's swift action decreases everyone's exposure to the danger of unbridled aggression. However, close and skilled observation with midazolam is required as the respiratory depression is dangerous. Lorazepam used on its own does not compare favourably to the combination treatment. Use of haloperidol alone brings with it additional risk of avoidable periods of aggression and serious adverse effects. Olanzapine given as an intramuscular injection compares well with the less expensive, older combination of haloperidol plus promethazine in terms of tranquillisation, but the effects of the combination treatment are of longer duration. With olanzapine, re-escalation of the aggression and re-injection are more frequent compared with haloperidol plus promethazine. Like olanzapine, ziprasidone compares well for pace of tranquillisation but also seems to wear off quickly with the danger of re-escalation of the aggression that the combination seems to avoid. Haloperidol plus midazolam seems to provide little difference to the use of midazolam alone. This particular combination probably carries the disadvantage of the use of haloperidol without anything to offset the acute dystonia that haloperidol causes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>All drug interventions included in the review are effective in calming agitation or aggression thought to be due to mental illness. Haloperidol plus promethazine is effective and safe. Benzodiazepines work, with midazolam being particularly swift, but both midazolam and lorazepam cause respiratory depression (probably midazolam more so than lorazepam), and we would question the use of this group of drugs outside of those services fully confident of observing for and managing the consequences of respiratory distress. Olanzapine intramuscular and ziprasidone intramuscular do seem to be viable options and are swift acting, but neither seems to last very long, and resumption of the aggression with subsequent need to re-inject seems more likely than with haloperidol plus promethazine. Haloperidol used on its own without something to offset its frequent and serious adverse effects does seem difficult to justify.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For policymakers</HEADING>
<P>There is compelling evidence that the combination treatment of haloperidol plus promethazine is effective and safe, at least within the context of a system that employs the use of restraints. The combination has been the focus of six trials (total n=1367) and compares favourably with all other drugs, including newer, more expensive treatments. All options are welcome for clinicians in this most difficult of situations, but the combination treatment of haloperidol plus promethazine is now becoming a gold standard against which others must be compared.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>The TREC studies' simplicity of design, real-world practicality, and attention to outcomes of interest to both healthcare providers and recipients of care should be a model for other urgently needed studies. We think it important to ensure that all reporting meets highest <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> standards and that all data are available for future researchers (<A HREF="http://www.alltrials.net/">AllTrials</A>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Reviews</HEADING>
<P>The two new included studies and excluded studies show that this area is beginning to be active and that there are more reviews to undertake in this area. Also, several of the excluded studies, although clearly not relevant for this review, could find value in other existing Cochrane reviews or suggest new titles (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Trials</HEADING>
<P>The 2012 update stated "Many more studies are needed in this area. Replication of the work of the TREC trialists in different settings should be undertaken." We are pleased to see that new studies have been undertaken that can be added to this review and others. There is still much work to do and many more evaluations in this area to undertake. This is a delicate and difficult area, and all care should be based firmly on good trial evidence. Local practice will differ, and it can be problematic to accept and apply evidence from different care cultures. We provide no specific recommendation for which interventions should be evaluated, as there are many that justify randomisation within studies that have a focus on real-world outcomes. However, some may feel that use of haloperidol unaccompanied by medication to specifically offset the acute dystonia is difficult to justify. We also feel that the new studies, <LINK REF="STD-Baldacara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Baldacara 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 2013</LINK>, underpowered themselves by including many comparisons. It is important to keep the design in this area pragmatic (<LINK REF="REF-Thorpe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tosh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tosh 2011</LINK>). We have suggested an outline design in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> but recommend no scales or measures as these are largely not used in routine care and are problematic to collect, analyse, and interpret.</P>

<P>We consulted Clive E Adams (CEA) regarding the multiple time periods for which data are now available. We wanted to balance maximising the value of the efforts of trialists but not undermine the protocol by presenting data in such a way that promotes multiple and needless analysis. CEA, blind to data, suggested keeping to protocol for the 30-minute outcomes and adding 1 hour as a time period, as the first 60 minutes are so important clinically. He also suggested presenting data for the longer-term outcomes 'by &gt; 2 to &#8804; 6 hours' as one group. We recognise that this is driven by the trials and was not been pre-stated in the original protocol. However, we think in this clinical situation the broad category has some meaning, and we did not come to this decision after assimilating the data.</P>
<P>For the 2015 update, we have added some data into a seventh comparison. This was just to ensure that this is the full repository of data from the relevant trial. This comparison contains some extra data at the 40-minute stage that does not materially change any part of the review.</P>
<P>We have updated some methods to reflect current methodology of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group. We moved the outcome 'specific behaviour' down the secondary outcomes list.</P>

<P>1. Study selection<BR/>We (GH and JA) independently inspected the citations identified from the search. We identified potentially relevant abstracts and ordered full papers for reassessment for inclusion and methodological quality. We discussed and reported any disagreements and contacted study authors for further clarification where necessary.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of quality<BR/>Again working independently, we allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Concealment of allocation remains the key aspect of methodology that predicts how susceptible results are to the inclusion of biases. Although adherence to blinding at outcome is also important, it is the ability of everyone involved to predict who will receive the next intervention that most substantially influences results. Category A studies in this review, where good concealment of allocation was made explicit, employed techniques that ensured that researchers and recipients could not have known the next intervention to be used. We considered these studies at low risk of bias. Any plausible biases were felt to be unlikely to seriously affect results. Category B studies assured the reader that studies were randomised but they did not make concealment of allocation explicit. We would have included these studies but these would have been at moderate risk of bias with some doubts about the results. We did not include Category C studies, where the process of allocation is neither described nor implied. These studies are at high risk of bias and the plausible bias seriously weakens confidence in the results.</P>
<P>If disputes had arisen as to which category a trial was to be allocated, again, resolution was to have been attempted by discussion. We included only trials in Category A or B in the review. Other dimensions of quality were not reasons for exclusion.</P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We (GH, JA) independently extracted data from included studies. Again, any disagreement was discussed, decisions documented and, if necessary, we contacted the authors of the studies for clarification. We documented justifications for excluding references from the review.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat assumptions<BR/>For studies that did not specify the reasons for people leaving the study early, we assumed that these people had no change in clinical outcome variables. We excluded data from outcomes where attrition was greater than 50%.</P>
<P>5. Data analysis<BR/>5.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Where binary results were statistically significant we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">http://www.nntonline.net/</A>) which takes account of the event rate in the control group.</P>
<P>5.2 Continuous data<BR/>5.2.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (Altman 1996); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>5.2.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes we estimated a fixed-effect weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups.</P>
<P>5.2.3 Valid scales: we included continuous data from rating scales only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) and the instrument was either a self-report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P>
<P>5.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: we find it preferable to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values and is easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are very problematic to interpret. If endpoint data had not been available, we would have used change data.</P>
<P>5.2.5 Cluster trials: studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (Bland 1997, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>6. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented, primarily, by employing the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Data were then re-analysed using a random-effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, and results became more consistent, i.e. falling below 75% in the estimate, the studies were added to the main body of trials. If using the random-effects model did not make a difference and inconsistency remained high, data were not summated, but were presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>7. Addressing small study bias<BR/>We were to have entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>8. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>If necessary, we analysed the effect of including studies with high attrition rates in a sensitivity analysis. We also included trials in a sensitivity analysis if they were described as 'double blind' but only implied randomisation. If we found no substantive differences within primary outcomes when these high attrition and 'implied randomisation' studies were added to the overall results, we included them in the final analysis. However, if there was a substantive difference we only used clearly randomised trials, and those with attrition lower than 50%.</P>
<P>9. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for haloperidol plus promethazine.</P>
