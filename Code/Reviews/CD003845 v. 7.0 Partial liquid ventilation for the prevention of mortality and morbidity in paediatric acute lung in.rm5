<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 01:29:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of partial liquid ventilation to decrease the number of deaths and illness in children with acute onset respiratory failure is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials.</P>
<P>Severely ill children can develop lung disease, called acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which stops sufficient oxygenation of the blood. The children are treated with mechanical ventilation through a tube placed in the airway. This improves lung function and the supply of oxygen to the body but it can also lead to ventilator-induced lung injury. Children who survive an episode of this severe lung disease often have long-term illness including decreased lung function, impaired cognitive function, poor neurodevelopmental progress, and high rates of permanent disability.</P>
<P>Partial liquid ventilation could be a less injurious form of respiratory support. A special liquid (perfluorocarbon liquid) is poured into the lungs to partly replace the gas in the normally gas-filled lungs, and mechanical ventilation is continued with a gas ventilator.</P>
<P>We found only one multicentre randomized controlled study, reported as an abstract in conference proceedings, that was eligible for inclusion in this updated Cochrane review. The company sponsored study enrolled 182 patients in 65 centres. The trial was stopped early, before recruiting sufficient numbers of participants and before it could detect any clear differences between partial liquid ventilation and conventional mechanical ventilation (the control group). The number of deaths at 28 days was 22% of patients in the partial liquid ventilation group and 14% in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant; there was a wide variation in results and a clinically significant difference could not be excluded. There were other problems with the trial that made its results unreliable in terms of eligible patients, use of other rescue therapies, and that the measured outcomes were altered at least twice during the study; additional therapies such as high frequency ventilation or inhaled nitric oxide were allowed in the control group.</P>

<P>Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are syndromes of severe respiratory failure. Children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome have high mortality and the survivors have significant morbidity. Partial liquid ventilation is proposed as a less injurious form of respiratory support for these children. Uncontrolled studies in adults have shown improvements in gas exchange and lung compliance with partial liquid ventilation. A single uncontrolled study in six children with acute respiratory syndrome showed some improvement in gas exchange during three hours of partial liquid ventilation.

<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared partial liquid ventilation with other forms of ventilation in children (aged 28 days to 18 years) with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

<P>Only one study enrolling 182 patients (reported as an abstract in conference proceedings) was identified and found eligible for inclusion; the authors reported only limited results. The trial was stopped prematurely and was, therefore, under-powered to detect any significant differences and at high risk of bias. The only available outcome of clinical significance was 28-day mortality. There was no statistically significant difference between groups, with a relative risk for 28-day mortality in the partial liquid ventilation group of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.9).</P>

<P>There is no evidence from RCTs to support or refute the use of partial liquid ventilation in children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Adequately powered, high quality RCTs are still needed to assess its efficacy. Clinically relevant outcome measures should be assessed (mortality at discharge and later, duration of both respiratory support and hospital stay, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes). The studies should be published in full.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:14:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:05:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Acute lung injury (ALI), known in its most severe form as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a syndrome of severe respiratory failure characterized by acute onset severe hypoxaemia and bilateral chest infiltrates on chest x-ray, without evidence of left heart failure. ARDS was first described by Ashbaugh in 1967 (<LINK REF="REF-Ashbaugh-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashbaugh 1967</LINK>) in a case series that included one 11 year old child. The causes of ALI or ARDS are many. They may result from lung disease (pneumonia, aspiration or inhalation injury, lung trauma, fat emboli, near-drowning) or extrapulmonary causes (septicaemia, trauma and shock, cardio-pulmonary bypass, drug overdose, acute pancreatitis, transfusion) (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>). Malignancy and infection (septicaemia or pneumonia) are common underlying antecedents in children (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeBruin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBruin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Timmons-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmons 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>ALI or ARDS results in poor matching of ventilation and perfusion within the lung, and subsequent severe hypoxaemia. This situation is known as ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. The syndrome is also characterized by severe heterogeneous atelectasis and decreased lung compliance. Hence, patients with ALI or ARDS universally require respiratory support and the mainstay of treatment is endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2001</LINK>). The syndrome is also characterized by a prominent pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response. There is loss of integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier in the lung with increased inflammatory cell and oxygen free radical mediated injury and increased pulmonary and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>). ALI or ARDS is further complicated by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and associated secondary inflammatory effects. VILI arises through either overdistention of the lung (volutrauma) or the use of high pressure within the lung (barotrauma), or a combination of these factors. Decreasing baro- and volutrauma may lower mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Werf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Werf 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally accepted mortality figures for ALI or ARDS in adults have ranged from 40% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>) although studies have shown decreasing mortality over time (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milberg 1995</LINK>). Mortality in children seems to be somewhat greater, with typical rates higher than 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Costil-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costil 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeBruin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBruin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paret-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paret 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Timmons-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmons 1991</LINK>). Mortality is often due to the primary disease process, especially septicaemia or associated multiple organ system failure (MOSF), rather than respiratory failure per se (<LINK REF="REF-Monchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monchi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfenninger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfenninger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zilberberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zilberberg 1998</LINK>) and therefore may not be amenable to alterations in ventilatory techniques.</P>
<P>Recent studies show a lower mortality with 'protective' ventilatory strategies or an 'open-lung' approach in adults with ARDS. This suggests that VILI does have a role in increasing mortality and that decreasing baro- and volutrauma may lead to improved survival (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baudouin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baudouin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Werf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Werf 2001</LINK>). A recent Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Petrucci-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrucci 2007</LINK>) on ventilation with lower tidal volumes versus traditional tidal volumes in adults with ALI or ARDS concluded that whilst short-term mortality was reduced by using ventilation with lower tidal volume there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about morbidity and long-term outcomes. Mortality and other outcomes have been shown to vary with the sex and age of the patient, the initial severity of the ALI or ARDS, the patient's condition, and the underlying cause of the ALI or ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeBruin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBruin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monchi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paret-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paret 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suntharalingam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suntharalingam 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also substantial short- and long-term morbidity associated with these syndromes. Short-term morbidity leads to prolonged ventilator dependence and longer stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Long-term morbidity includes decreased lung function, decreased health-related quality of life, neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive impairments, and high rates of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Fanconi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanconi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothenhausler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothenhausler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schelling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schelling 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:08:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The mainstay of treatment of ALI or ARDS is mechanical ventilation. Many forms of additional therapies have been considered and some of these were subjected to randomized controlled trials. Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation have included extracorporeal life support (ECLS), inhaled nitric oxide, endogenous surfactant, prone positioning, high frequency ventilation, and a variety of pharmaceutical therapies (anti-inflammatory medication, antioxidants, anticytokine agents, prostaglandins) (<LINK REF="REF-Conner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarnaik-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarnaik 1994</LINK>). The ventilatory techniques that seem to improve outcomes in ALI or ARDS are the 'lung-protective' strategies that aim to decrease VILI (<LINK REF="REF-Brower-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brower 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Werf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Werf 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) has been proposed as a less injurious form of respiratory support for patients with severe respiratory failure, ALI and ARDS. In 1991, Fuhrman et al (<LINK REF="REF-Fuhrman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuhrman 1991</LINK>) introduced the technique of using functional residual capacity (FRC) volumes of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFC) with conventional gas ventilation; they called it perfluorocarbon associated gas exchange (PAGE).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:10:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This technique has become known as PLV and consists of partially filling the lungs with PFC whilst continuing mechanical ventilation with a gas ventilator. Of the available techniques of liquid assisted ventilation, it is PLV which has the most promise for practical clinical application in intensive care. Various models of acute lung injury have shown the benefits of using PLV compared with conventional mechanical ventilation alone. Many animal studies have shown that PLV improves oxygenation, carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) removal, and lung compliance, and leads to less lung damage and VILI (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>). All of these benefits are achieved whilst using lower ventilatory pressures and smaller tidal volumes (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>). PLV also gives superior alveolar recruitment in the dependent areas of the lung and redistributes pulmonary blood flow to improve V/Q matching and decrease intrapulmonary shunting (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>). PFCs have also been demonstrated to have significant anti-inflammatory effects, in both in vivo animal models of ALI and in vitro cell cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>). PFCs can decrease inflammatory cytokine release and oxygen free radical production by alveolar macrophages and decrease neutrophil activation and chemotaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:14:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Uncontrolled human studies using PLV in adults with ALI or ARDS have shown improvements in oxygenation and lung compliance in patients also on ECLS (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschl-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschl 1996</LINK>), and improved gas exchange with haemodynamic stability and minimal adverse side effects in patients ventilated with PLV alone (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschl 1998</LINK>). The efficacy of PLV in adults has been assessed in a separate Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004a</LINK>) and there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of PLV in adults with ALI or ARDS. A single uncontrolled study in six children with ARDS showed some improvement in gas exchange with three hours of PLV (<LINK REF="REF-Fedora-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedora 1999a</LINK>). The optimal dose of PFC to use during PLV is unknown and its beneficial effects may be apparent at lower doses of PFC than the usual method where the initial dose of PFC is equivalent to the functional residual capacity (approximately 30 ml/kg). Variations in the technique of PLV may also include giving an initial dose of PFC with or without further top-up doses to maintain partial filling of the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:41:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven reports of nine studies were initially located by the original search strategy. Eight of the studies were excluded (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). There were no disagreements between authors.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fuhrman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fuhrman 1998</LINK>) was identified and found eligible for inclusion in this review. It has only been reported as an abstract in conference proceedings. We have contacted the first author of this study and the company that sponsored it but no further information and data were forthcoming from either source.</P>
<P>The study ran from January 1996 to April 1997 and enrolled 182 patients in 65 centres. At enrolment, patients were allocated to receive either PLV (N = 91) or conventional mechanical ventilation (control group, N = 91). The study was complicated by the fact that entry criteria, the use of other rescue therapies, and the primary outcome were modified at least twice during the study. These modifications included liberalization of the entry criteria and allowed use of adjunct therapies in the control group, such as high frequency ventilation or inhaled nitric oxide, or both. The study was stopped well short of the expected recruitment (less than 20%) because of an "abrupt decline" in mortality in the control group. Mortality at 28 days was 22% in the PLV group and 14% in the control group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. It is not clear why the study did not continue thereafter. Other outcomes reported for PLV versus control were: overall mortality (not defined) 26% versus 20%; 28-day respiratory mortality 10% versus 10%; ventilator free days (not defined) 10.1 versus 12.4; and air leak 33% versus 30%. None of these outcomes showed statistically significant differences.</P>

<P>The updated search was conducted in November 2011. Out of 58 studies identified from the primary electronic databases (MEDLINE 15, EMBASE 42, CENTRAL 0, CINAHL 1) 12 were duplicates, leaving 46 abstracts or titles identified as original publications. Of these, 16 proved potentially relevant for full text review but after independent review no article met our eligibility criteria (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).  The grey literature search identified one potentially relevant title and abstract but it was found to be ineligible after full text review.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:45:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited results were available from only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fuhrman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fuhrman 1998</LINK>) which was stopped prematurely. The only outcome of clinical significance that was available from the only published report of this trial was 28-day mortality. Although it was not reported, we assumed 100% follow up for analysis of this short-term outcome. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for this outcome, with a relative risk for 28-day mortality in the PLV group of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.9).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 02:47:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While it has been suggested that PLV is a promising alternative mode of mechanical ventilation for children with ALI or ARDS, there are no available data from adequately powered RCTs to determine whether PLV is effective, or not, in decreasing morbidity or mortality.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-11 23:40:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The study by Fuhrman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Fuhrman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fuhrman 1998</LINK>) was stopped prematurely and was, therefore, under-powered to detect any significant differences. The wide 95% confidence interval for 28-day mortality meant that a clinically significant difference cannot be excluded.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-11 23:40:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>It is unfortunate that the only RCT done so far to investigate PLV in children with ALI or ARDS (<LINK REF="STD-Fuhrman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fuhrman 1998</LINK>) has not been published in full or that data on more clinically relevant outcomes (especially mortality at discharge and later, duration of both respiratory support and hospital stay, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes) are not forthcoming from the study investigators or the company that sponsored the trial. <BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-11 23:40:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The under-reporting of RCTs due to publication bias has been well described (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1993</LINK>). In a systematic review of pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcomes, Lexchin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>) found that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published. Some people consider the selection of reports for publication on the basis of 'positive results' or the failure of investigators to publish results with sufficient detail to allow judgments to be made about their validity as scientific misconduct (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1990</LINK>). It is unknown whether any of these factors are operating here.</P>
