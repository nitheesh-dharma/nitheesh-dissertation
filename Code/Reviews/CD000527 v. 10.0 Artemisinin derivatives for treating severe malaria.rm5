<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review was first published in 1999, Issue 2, and was undertaken to provide a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks of this new class of antimalarial drugs in different epidemiological settings. It aimed to inform drug policy decisions on their rational use, and the clinical questions addressed by the review were based on what needed clarifying at that time. The comparison of artemether versus quinine for treating severe malaria was subsequently assessed in a meta-analysis of individual patient data (Artemether-Quinine Meta-analysis Study Group. A meta-analysis using individual patient data of trials comparing artemether with quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria. <I>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</I>. 2001;95(6):637-50), which supported the findings of this review of summary data.</P>
<P>Further research and development in this area has focused on specific preparations of arteether and artemether. Trials of these preparations, including new trials conducted through the World Health Organization, are now assessed as separate Cochrane Reviews.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, no longer necessary or expedient to update this review in its existing format. It will continue to appear in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> for information only.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Artemisinin drugs improve survival in severe malaria. Artemisinin drugs come originally from a plant that has been used since ancient times in China as a traditional medicine for fever and malaria. They are fast acting and effective against malaria parasites that have developed resistance to quinine. The review shows that treatment with artemisinin drugs may be better than quinine at preventing death in adults and children with severe and complicated malaria. There is no evidence so far against early treatment with suppositories in rural areas whilst patients are transferred to hospital. Few side effects have been reported with these drugs. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Artemisinin derivatives may have advantages over quinoline drugs for treating severe malaria since they are fast acting and effective against quinine resistant malaria parasites. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of artemisinin drugs for severe and complicated falciparum malaria in adults and children. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-20 09:18:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, LILACS, African Index Medicus, conference abstracts, and reference lists of articles. We contacted organisations, researchers in the field and drug companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and pseudo-randomised trials comparing artemisinin drugs (rectal, intramuscular or intravenous) with standard treatment, or comparisons between artemisinin derivatives in adults or children with severe or complicated falciparum malaria. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligibility, trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for additional information. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty three trials are included, allocation concealment was adequate in nine. Sixteen trials compared artemisinin drugs with quinine in 2653 patients. Artemisinin drugs were associated with better survival (mortality odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.82, random effects model). In trials where concealment of allocation was adequate (2261 patients), this was barely statistically significant (odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.96, random effects model). In 1939 patients with cerebral malaria, mortality was also lower with artemisinin drugs overall (odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88, random effects model). The difference was not significant however when only trials reporting adequate concealment of allocation were analysed (odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, random effects model) based on 1607 patients. No difference in neurological sequelae was shown. Compared with quinine, artemisinin drugs showed faster parasite clearance from the blood and similar adverse effects. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence suggests that artemisinin drugs are no worse than quinine in preventing death in severe or complicated malaria. No artemisinin derivative appears to be better than the others. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-30 09:33:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is related to another by the same authors entitled: Artemisinin derivatives for treating uncomplicated malaria which contains general background information on malaria and the artemisinin derivatives.</P>
<P>Every year severe and complicated malaria results in an estimated 2-3 million deaths caused by Plasmodium falciparum (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PRISM-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISM 1996</LINK>). The primary goal of treatment for these patients is to save life and reduce the chance of serious complications developing. The rate of clinical response and clearance of parasites from the blood can provide useful comparative information between alternative treatments, although the clinical significance, particularly in cerebral malaria, is debatable (<LINK REF="REF-White-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1989</LINK>). The balance between the risks of drug toxicity and the benefits of antimalarial drug action is also different in severe and complicated malaria compared with uncomplicated infections. Artemisinin derivatives are fast-acting and effective against quinine resistant malaria parasites; available in parenteral and suppository form they can be administered once a day. These drugs may, therefore, have particular advantages over quinoline drugs in the treatment of severe malaria, in preventing clinical deterioration if used early, suppositories in particular being practical for early treatment in rural areas.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to summarise the existing evidence of effectiveness and safety of artemisinin derivatives, alone and in combination with other antimalarials, in the treatment of severe and complicated falciparum malaria in different epidemiological settings. The following clinical questions will be addressed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Are treatment regimens with artemisinin drugs better than standard treatment regimens for severe and complicated malaria?</LI>
<LI>Do artemisinin drugs have a comparative advantage over other antimalarials in geographical areas where malaria parasites are still sensitive to existing antimalarial drugs, as well as in areas where drug resistance is high?</LI>
<LI>Should artemisinin derivatives be combined de novo with longer-acting antimalarials in the treatment of severe and complicated malaria?</LI>
<LI>Is any artemisinin derivative better than the others?</LI>
<LI>For any artemisinin derivative having a comparative advantage over other antimalarial drugs, what is the best formulation, dose and treatment regimen?</LI>
</OL>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-14 18:58:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the effectiveness and safety of artemisinin drugs versus standard treatment regimens, and the relative performance of each derivative, in treating adults and children with severe and complicated falciparum malaria. Effectiveness is defined in terms of survival, time to recover consciousness and resolution of clinical symptoms, clearance of asexual parasites from the blood (parasitological cure) and tolerance.</P>
<P>The following null hypotheses will be explored or tested, depending on the data available:</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is no difference in effectiveness or toxicity between artemisinin derivatives and existing standard treatment regimens.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There is no difference in effectiveness or toxicity between different artemisinin derivatives.</LI>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-20 09:19:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An advisory panel was established, comprising individuals with relevant methodological and content knowledge, plus a potential user of the review, to advise on content, quality and dissemination of the review, as set out in Editorial Information about the Infectious Diseases Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-14 18:58:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials identified were entered in a database register. The inclusion criteria we11re applied to all identified studies independently by the two reviewers. In the event of disagreement, the opinion of a member of the advisory panel was sought.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 10:21:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data for the pre-specified outcome measures was abstracted on to a collection form by the first reviewer, and repeated independently by another person. Whenever possible authors were asked to provide additional data. The primary efficacy parameter is survival. Parasite clearance is compared on days 7 and 28, or at the end of follow-up if longer than 28 days, where data are available. Parasitological cure was calculated from the number of patients evaluable with losses to follow-up included in sensitivity analyses.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-30 10:24:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias in the included trials was assessed in terms of allocation concealment, generation of the allocation sequence, blinding and inclusion of all randomised participants according to the Infectious Diseases Group guidelines.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 10:22:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Analysis was done in Review Manager (Update Software) pooling data where appropriate. Odds ratios for dichotomous data were first calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed effect model); the DerSimonian &amp; Laird method (random effect model) was also used if heterogeneity between studies was evident from the graphical display and the Chi square test for homogeneity. To make interpretation easier we also reported results as risk ratios. It was not possible to estimate time to event outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier procedure, as initially intended, due to lack of data. The mean difference was, therefore, calculated from reported data.</P>
<P>The following comparisons were made:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Artemisinin or derivative drug versus WHO recommended standard treatment, for pre-specified outcomes grouped by comparator drug.</LI>
<LI>Any artemisinin derivative versus any other, for each pre-specified outcome.</LI>
<LI>Different dose or route of administration.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Where significant statistical heterogeneity was found within these comparisons, with the direction of effect being different in the various studies, possible explanations were sought through exploring hypotheses addressing differences in the intervention (dose, duration, formulation/route of administration, regimen), and participants (level of disease severity, immunity).</P>
<P>In comparisons of artemisinin derivatives versus existing antimalarial drugs, the effectiveness of the new drug might be greater in areas where resistance to existing drugs has been demonstrated. We pre-specified that they will be stratified according to the existing level of resistance to the comparator drug in the study area if there is heterogeneity evident in these comparisons to explore the following hypothesis:</P>
<P>The effectiveness of artemisinin drugs compared with existing treatment regimens is greater in areas where resistance to the comparator drug(s) has been demonstrated than in areas where it has not been demonstrated.</P>
<P>We pre-specified that additional appropriate subgroup analyses may be identified only through discussion of the initial tabulations with individuals on the advisory panel, provided justification was clear cut.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>One study was reported as double blind, one reported that the physicians and technicians were blinded, and one that only the microscopists who assessed parasitaemia were blind to treatment allocation. Twelve studies were described as either not blinded, open or open-label (in all cases blinding was limited by differences in regimen or route of administration between the treatment groups), of these, three specified that the microscopists were blind to treatment allocation, and one other reported blinding of the assessors of neurological sequelae at follow-up. The remaining nine studies did not report on blinding, however, in five of these, differences in regimen or route of administration between the treatment groups would have precluded blinding of the providers.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Artemisinin drug compared with quinine</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen studies compared an artemisinin derivative with quinine: artemisinin, three comparisons (artemisinin 87 patients, quinine 98); artesunate, five comparisons (artesunate 213 patients, quinine 245); artemether, eleven comparisons (artemether 1069 patients, quinine 1073). In total, 1284 patients treated with an artemisinin derivative were compared with 1284 patients treated with quinine.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>All sixteen studies reported on mortality. Nine studies admitted only patients with cerebral malaria, whereas seven included both cerebral and non-cerebral malaria patients.</P>
<P>In two comparisons of artemisinin with quinine, deaths were similar in the two groups (artemisinin: 7/50; quinine: 11/63), although one study had unbalanced arms because part-way through the supply of artemisinin ran out and further patients were all recruited into the quinine and artesunate groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-89_x002d_90" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 89-90</LINK>). In the other study there were slightly fewer deaths in the artemisinin group (2/37 compared with 5/35) (<LINK REF="STD-PhuongVNM-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">PhuongVNM 92-5</LINK>). Overall, there was no evidence of a significant difference in effectiveness in the combined estimate (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.65, fixed effect model).</P>
<P>In five comparisons of artesunate with quinine, two show a significant benefit with artesunate and three a non-significant tendency in favour of artesunate. Pooled analysis shows significantly fewer deaths in patients treated with artesunate over quinine (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.61). The weight of this evidence comes partly from one study where the researchers stopped using artesunate part-way through, while continuing to recruit patients into the quinine group. Without this study, the meta-analysis result is still statistically significant (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23, 0.77).</P>
<P>In eleven comparisons of artemether with quinine, no study showed that artemether was worse than quinine. The two largest studies (both with over 275 patients per group) showed similar numbers of deaths in the artemether and quinine groups. Three studies showed quite large differences in effectiveness between the two drugs, in favour of artemether, but these were based on small numbers of patients, and two scored low on quality assessment for concealment of allocation. The overall odds ratio is marginally in favour of artemether (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.57, 0.91, random effect model); excluding the three studies with inadequate methods removes the statistical significance (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59, 1.05, random effect model).</P>
<P>Pooled analysis of all artemisinin drug comparisons with quinine gives a result in favour of artemisinin drugs, with some heterogeneity between studies (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46, 0.82, random effect model). The pooled Risk Ratio Reduction is 48% (95% CI 54% to 18%) using random effect analysis. The pooled data also gives a number needed to treat (NNT) of 25 (95% CI 16, 65). This is an estimate of the number of patients we would need to treat with an artemisinin drug in order to prevent one more death compared with quinine (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1996</LINK>). These pooled estimates must, however, be interpreted with caution, as there is heterogeneity in the outcome between studies. Furthermore, the statistical difference is barely significant without the six studies that did not report adequate concealment of allocation: RRR 24% (95% CI 40% to 3%); OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54, 0.96, random effect model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality: cerebral malaria</HEADING>
<P>Five studies that included both cerebral and non-cerebral malaria patients reported the death rate in these subgroups. Only the smallest study showed an almost significant result in favour of artesunate in cerebral malaria (1/11 artesunate, 3/5 quinine). With artemisinin in two studies 3/15 cerebral malaria patients died compared with 6/12 given quinine, a difference that is not significant. In the largest study, the difference between artemether and quinine approached significance only in the non-cerebral malaria subgroup (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>, 15/142 artemether, 23/128 quinine).</P>
<P>Pooling all the available data for only patients with cerebral malaria gives an odds ratio in favour of artemisinin drugs (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44, 0.88, random effect model) and a Risk Ratio Reduction of 31% (48% to 10%) but the difference is not significant when only studies reporting adequate concealment of allocation are analysed: RRR 19% (40% to -7%); OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55, 1.10, random effect model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Coma recovery and neurological sequelae</HEADING>
<P>All sixteen studies reported time to recovery of consciousness in comatose patients. Six reported median and range (four using survival analysis) two reported mean and range and seven reported mean and standard deviation (of which one also gave 95% confidence intervals).</P>
<P>The study reports show no significant difference in coma recovery time between artemisinin suppositories and intravenous quinine (<LINK REF="STD-PhuongVNM-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">PhuongVNM 92-5</LINK>, based on 8 children; <LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-89_x002d_90" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 89-90</LINK>, based on 48 adults; <LINK REF="STD-Birku-ETH-96_x002d_7" TYPE="STUDY">Birku ETH 96-7</LINK>, based on 10 adults).</P>
<P>One large study using survival analysis showed that artemether prolonged coma recovery time (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>, 66 h artemether, 48 h quinine, p = 0.003 based on 349 patients). Another large study showed a much less significant difference in favour of quinine (<LINK REF="STD-vanHensbroekGAM92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">vanHensbroekGAM92-4</LINK>, 26h artemether, 20h quinine, p = 0.046 based on 444 patients). Of the remaining six studies (accounting for about one third of patients in this comparison) five showed no difference and one reported faster coma recovery with artemether (<LINK REF="STD-Ojuawo-NIG-_x0028_98_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ojuawo NIG (98)</LINK>.</P>
<P>Our graphical presentation of MD for the studies reporting mean and standard deviation, or for which we were able to obtain or estimate this data, highlights heterogeneity between studies and evidence of a skewed distribution in most of the data (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Mean difference may, therefore, be an inappropriate statistical method to analyse this data. Only one of four comparisons of artesunate with quinine showed a significant difference in favour of artesunate (<LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>, 69 adults). Survival analysis is more appropriate for such time-to data, therefore, using the data as reported we are unable to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis for this outcome.</P>
<P>Neurological sequelae were reported in ten studies comparing an artemisinin derivative with quinine. The time at which sequelae were assessed was not always explicit and varied from study to study. Four reported on sequelae at discharge. Two others only reported a 7 day follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Karbwang-THI-91" TYPE="STUDY">Karbwang THI 91</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ojuawo-NIG-_x0028_98_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ojuawo NIG (98)</LINK>. Taylor assessed sequelae at 96 hours by which time all patients had recovered consciousness. Win reported at recovery of coma and residual. Karbwang (<LINK REF="STD-KarbwangTHI92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">KarbwangTHI92-4</LINK>) assessed sequelae at recovery of consciousness, but did not specify how many cerebral malaria patients survived, her data, therefore, are yet to be included in our meta-analysis. Olumese (<LINK REF="STD-Olumese-NIG-94_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Olumese NIG 94-6</LINK>) recorded sequelae within the 28 day study period.</P>
<P>Neurological sequelae reported at recovery or discharge were analysed together as 'neurological sequelae at recovery' using the number of cerebral malaria survivors as the denominator. The type of sequelae recorded by investigators include movement disorders, paralysis, difficulty in walking, speech impairment, blindness, deafness, mental disorders and behavioural abnormalities. The study which compared artemisinin and artesunate assessed less than 20 patients.</P>
<P>For artemether, more patients have been studied, however, there is wide variation in the number of neurological sequelae at recovery in various trials. Van Hensbroek points out that, due to bed shortage, some children in his study were discharged whilst still weak, often not able to stand or walk, and were counted as neurological sequelae cases (MB van Hensbroek, personal communication). Only one study in our meta-analysis reached statistical significance, due to seven cases of transient organic psychosis in the quinine group (<LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>). In one study artemether was worse than quinine. Overall, there is no convincing pattern in favour of either drug: RRR 16% (40 to -18%); OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52, 1.25, random effect model.</P>
<P>One study examined neurological sequelae at one and around five months, to assess whether the deficits were transient or long-term (<LINK REF="STD-vanHensbroekGAM92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">vanHensbroekGAM92-4</LINK>). The 23% of patients across both groups with some neurological deficit at discharge fell to 4% at five months, with 92% follow-up: 7/209 artemether, 11/209 quinine. Murphy reported similar persistent deficits in both groups. Karbwang (<LINK REF="STD-KarbwangTHI92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">KarbwangTHI92-4</LINK>) reported one case of facial palsy persisting for over a month in a patient treated with quinine. Taylor reported blindness lasting up to at least 5 months in one artemether patient. Olumese reported hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) lasting more than 28 days in one quinine-treated patient.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Time to regain motor function</HEADING>
<P>Only one study comparing artemether with quinine reported fully on time to drink, eat, sit, stand and walk (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>). No significant difference was shown between the treatment groups. Another study reported no significant difference in time to walk (<LINK REF="STD-Olumese-NIG-94_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Olumese NIG 94-6</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Time to leave hospital</HEADING>
<P>Only two studies reported on the duration of hospitalisation for surviving patients. One large study with artemether reported that hospitalisation was longer for patients treated with artemether (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>). One study showed no difference between artemisinin, artesunate and quinine in this respect (<LINK REF="STD-PhuongVNM-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">PhuongVNM 92-5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fever clearance time</HEADING>
<P>All sixteen studies reported fever clearance time. Four reported using survival analysis to derive the median and range, two reported median and range but did not mention survival analysis, one reported mean and range and seven reported mean and standard deviation(one of which also gave 95% confidence intervals). In studies where survival analysis was not used the number of patients who were actually assessed for fever clearance is rarely clear in the report. Most studies also mentioned using paracetamol or other fever-reducing interventions but did not discuss the effect that this may have had on the fever clearance time data that they reported.</P>
<P>The reported data show no difference between artemisinin and quinine in three studies. In one study, artesunate cleared fever significantly faster than quinine, whereas two reported no difference. For artemether compared with quinine, five studies showed no difference in fever clearance time, three showed that artemether was faster, and one showed that quinine was faster than artemether.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Parasite clearance</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen studies reported time to clearance of parasites from the blood; time to 50% and/or 90/95% clearance was also reported in 13 studies. Reporting of data was as inconsistent as described previously for fever clearance time.</P>
<P>All three studies comparing artemisinin with quinine concluded that artemisinin reduced parasitaemia significantly faster. All five comparisons of artesunate with quinine showed that artesunate cleared parasitaemia significantly faster. In seven studies, artemether cleared parasitaemia faster than quinine, and two others showed no difference. The three largest artemether studies fell into the first category and all used survival analysis; the median time to parasite clearance reported in these studies was 32 to 72 hours with artemether compared with 40 to 90 hours for quinine.</P>
<P>Eight studies reported parasite clearance at day 7. In our pooled analysis patients who had died by day 7 were counted as failures. The study that examined artemisinin and artesunate showed both were more effective than quinine (<LINK REF="STD-PhuongVNM-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">PhuongVNM 92-5</LINK>). In this study, mefloquine was given to all artemisinin and artesunate treated patients on day 4 whereas quinine treated patients received Fansidar on day 7. The second study that tested artemisinin was conducted in Africa and showed no difference (<LINK REF="STD-Birku-ETH-96_x002d_7" TYPE="STUDY">Birku ETH 96-7</LINK>). With artemether, three studies showed little or no difference, and two showed artemether to be more effective. The pooled odds ratio was 2.20, 95% CI 0.99, 4.91, random effect model).</P>
<P>Parasite clearance at day 28 was reported in five studies. Losses to follow-up were less than 10% in these studies, and were included as failures in our pooled analysis. The only artemisinin study showed no difference (<LINK REF="STD-Birku-ETH-96_x002d_7" TYPE="STUDY">Birku ETH 96-7</LINK>). There were more failures in the quinine group in the one artesunate study that reported this outcome, although some of the quinine patients were not actually randomised against the artesunate comparator group (<LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>, see discussion). No significant difference between artemether and quinine was shown in four trials (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.75, 4.05, random effect model).</P>
<P>Parasite clearance at day 28 is influenced by adjunctive long-acting antimalarial drugs given after completion of treatment (in one study a single sequential dose of Fansidar was given to all patients, and in another mefloquine was given to the artesunate group whilst tetracycline was given to patients treated with quinine). In the study by Taylor, the one artemether patient and 4/5 quinine patients who had a recrudescence by day 28 did not receive Fansidar at parasite clearance while in hospital as per protocol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tolerability, clinical</HEADING>
<P>No study reported adverse effects that resulted in discontinuation of treatment.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain): these were mentioned in six studies. Only three studies reported the number of events which were similar in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-KEN-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy KEN 92-4</LINK>, 10/100 artemether, 9/99 quinine) and higher for quinine in the other two (<LINK REF="STD-Birku-ETH-96_x002d_7" TYPE="STUDY">Birku ETH 96-7</LINK>, 3/30 artemisinin, 13/30 quinine; <LINK REF="STD-KarbwangTHI92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">KarbwangTHI92-4</LINK>, 24/47 artemether, 32/50 quinine). Abdominal pain was one of the most common events in patients treated with artemether, but not quinine, in the study by Danis. Win reported nausea in almost all patients treated with quinine but not artemether or artesunate. Phuong noted that there were no reports of diarrhoea or anal discomfort in patients given artemisinin suppositories.</P>
<P>Skin (pruritus, urticaria, rash): these were mentioned in four studies and tended to be associated more with quinine than artemether. The numbers were small: urticaria one case with quinine (<LINK REF="STD-vanHensbroekGAM92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">vanHensbroekGAM92-4</LINK>); rash 2/99 quinine (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-KEN-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy KEN 92-4</LINK>); rash 3/50 quinine compared with 1/47 artemether (<LINK REF="STD-KarbwangTHI92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">KarbwangTHI92-4</LINK>). Danis reported only that pruritus occurred with quinine but not artemether.</P>
<P>Local effects at injection site (pain, abscess): In one study of intramuscular artesunate no local pain or abscess occurred in 37 patients. Pain at the injection site was one of the "most common" adverse events with intramuscular artemether (<LINK REF="STD-Danis-WAF-93_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Danis WAF 93-4</LINK>), also occurring in 13/47 and 6/15 artemether patients in two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-KarbwangTHI92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">KarbwangTHI92-4</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seaton-PNG-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">Seaton PNG 92-5</LINK>). A fourth study, with almost 200 patients, reported no local adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-KEN-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy KEN 92-4</LINK>). In two comparisons with intramuscular quinine, pain or abscess was more common with quinine: 6/284 artemether, 12/276 quinine (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>, both drugs given every 8 hours); 1/288 artemether, 5/288 quinine (<LINK REF="STD-vanHensbroekGAM92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">vanHensbroekGAM92-4</LINK>, artemether given daily, quinine twice daily).</P>
<P>CNS (tinnitus, dizziness): ringing in the ears (tinnitus) affected only quinine patients in six studies. Dizziness or vertigo was reported only in quinine patients in one study and in all groups in another two.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tolerability, evidence from diagnostic tests</HEADING>
<P>Haematological (blood cell count, haemoglobin, packed cell volume): The only notable difference from blood examination was in the reticulocyte (immature red blood cell) count. One study of artemisinin and artesunate compared with quinine reported a poorer reticulocyte response (the rate of increase towards normal levels) in patients treated with the artemisinin derivatives, based on a subgroup of 56 patients sampled 5 days after treatment had started. Two studies with artemether reported a similar observation at 3 and 7 days (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-MAL-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor MAL 92-4</LINK>, 164 patients; <LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>, 560 patients). No change in daily reticulocyte count was noted by Seaton (<LINK REF="STD-Seaton-PNG-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">Seaton PNG 92-5</LINK>), and no change in any haematological test was noted in the two artemether studies by Karbwang (<LINK REF="STD-Karbwang-THI-91" TYPE="STUDY">Karbwang THI 91</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-KarbwangTHI92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">KarbwangTHI92-4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Metabolic (blood chemistry): Three artemether studies reported no difference in measured biochemical parameters. Eight studies reported post-treatment hypoglycaemia ( &lt;2.2mmol/l blood glucose). Quinine was significantly associated with hypoglycaemia in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Birku-ETH-96_x002d_7" TYPE="STUDY">Birku ETH 96-7</LINK>, 3/30 artemisinin, 19/30 quinine; <LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>, 31/284 artemether, 69/276 quinine; <LINK REF="STD-Seaton-PNG-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">Seaton PNG 92-5</LINK>, 0/15 artemether, 11/14 quinine), more likely to cause hypoglycaemia (but not statistically significant) in two others, and noted only in a few quinine patients in one other. The two remaining studies found that a similar number of patients given quinine or artemether developed hypoglycaemia. There is no obvious pattern in terms of study size, location, quinine regimen or route of administration (im or iv).</P>
<P>Cardiovascular (QT changes, arrhythmias): electrocardiogram (ECG) was used in seven studies to monitor adverse effects on the heart. Prolongation of the QT interval, an abnormality in the rhythm of the heart, was the most commonly reported event. The study which looked at artemisinin and artesunate noted a prolongation in 1/12 artemisinin patients and 2/10 on quinine in a subgroup of 32 patients during the study period. Win (<LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>) reported slowing of the heart rate (sinus bradycardia) in some patients on intravenous artesunate, this resolved spontaneously. With artemether, a prolongation of the QT interval by more than 25% was more common in quinine patients (11/157 artemether, 12/133 quinine) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91-6</LINK>), but more common with artemether (20/82 artemether, 5/80 quinine) in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-KEN-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy KEN 92-4</LINK>). One study showed no difference between artemether and quinine (<LINK REF="STD-Danis-WAF-93_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Danis WAF 93-4</LINK>, 241 patients).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Artemisinin drug compared with chloroquine</HEADING>
<P>In the one study that compared artemether with chloroquine (<LINK REF="STD-White-GAM-89" TYPE="STUDY">White GAM 89</LINK>), there were more deaths in the chloroquine group (6/22 chloroquine, 2/21 artemether), all patients who died had cerebral malaria on admission. There was no difference in the fever or parasite clearance times, or in the time to recover from coma, based on those patients who survived. There was a non-significant difference in the time to regain motor function in favour of artemether, although the investigators point out that coma score on admission was significantly higher in this group despite randomisation. The study showed no evidence of adverse local, CNS or cardiovascular toxic effects with either drug, nor any difference in haematological or metabolic parameters. Patients were discharged from hospital at around 4 days in both groups, when their fever had cleared, and longer-term toxicity and efficacy was not assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons between artemisinin drugs</HEADING>
<P>Four studies compared one artemisinin derivative with another: artemisinin versus artesunate (three comparisons); artemisinin versus artemether (one comparison); and artemether versus artesunate (two comparisons). The dose and duration of treatment varied between studies. The treatment arms were unbalanced in the studies by Win (<LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>) and Vinh (<LINK REF="STD-Vinh-VNM-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Vinh VNM 92-4</LINK>) because recruitment was stopped prematurely in the artemisinin and artesunate (iv) groups respectively, and in the study by Hien (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-89_x002d_90" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 89-90</LINK>) with no reason given. Vinh (<LINK REF="STD-Vinh-VNM-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Vinh VNM 92-4</LINK>) included two artesunate groups, one intramuscular and one intravenous; we have combined these groups for analysis of artesunate.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in mortality in the three comparisons of artemisinin suppositories with artesunate (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.63, 2.65, fixed effect model). Two studies included cerebral and non-cerebral malaria patients, only one separated the mortality data: there was no significant difference in cerebral malaria deaths between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-PhuongVNM-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">PhuongVNM 92-5</LINK>, 1/7 artemisinin, 1/11 artesunate).</P>
<P>Two studies used survival analysis to determine time to recover conciousness, and fever and parasite clearance times, one reported median and range, but no method (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-89_x002d_90" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 89-90</LINK>), and the fourth reported mean and standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>).</P>
<P>Survival analysis (two studies) showed no significant difference in time to recover consciousness between artemisinin, artesunate and artemether (147 comatose patients). Hien (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-89_x002d_90" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 89-90</LINK>) also showed no difference, although the number of patients evaluated is not explicit. Win's study showed artesunate to be slightly faster than artemether, but the groups were only partially randomised (see discussion). Neurological sequelae were reported in two studies, but the numbers were very small (<LINK REF="STD-PhuongVNM-92_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">PhuongVNM 92-5</LINK>, 1/6 artemisinin, 1/10 artesunate; <LINK REF="STD-Win-MYA-89_x002d_91" TYPE="STUDY">Win MYA 89-91</LINK>, 1/50 artemether, 0/27 artesunate). Vinh reported that no sequelae occurred, and the fourth study did not mention sequelae as an outcome.</P>
<P>Three studies, two using survival analysis, showed no difference between artemisinin derivatives in the time to clear fever or parasitaemia. Win showed no difference in fever clearance time between artesunate and artemether, but reported that artemether was significantly faster than artesunate at clearing parasites from the blood. Parasite clearance was reported at day 7 by Phuong, mefloquine was given on day 4, the numbers in each group were similar (artemisinin 35/37, artesunate 33/37). Parasite clearance at day 28 was reported by Win, mefloquine was given on day 2 and all survivors in both groups had no parasitaemia at day 28.</P>
<P>Only Phuong reported time to leave hospital and there was no difference between the groups.</P>
<P>Adverse events in the studies by Win and Phuong have been detailed earlier under comparisons with quinine, there were no differences between artemisinin derivatives used. In the studies by Hien (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-89_x002d_90" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 89-90</LINK>) and Vinh no adverse events were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons of same drug, different dose</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared different doses of intramuscular artemether, and two studies compared different doses of artesunate suppositories.</P>
<P>There were no deaths in these studies. In three, no neurological sequelae were observed in cerebral malaria patients within 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Karbwang-THI-92" TYPE="STUDY">Karbwang THI 92</LINK>, 8 patients; <LINK REF="STD-LooareesuwanTHI95" TYPE="STUDY">LooareesuwanTHI95</LINK>, 12 patients; <LINK REF="STD-Thwe-MYA-96" TYPE="STUDY">Thwe MYA 96</LINK>, 7 patients).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in parasite clearance at day 28 between the treatment groups in any study, although there was a tendency in favour of the higher dose in three studies where the duration of treatment was the same with both doses, or shorter for the lower dose. In the fourth study, the lower dose, given over a longer time period (7 days) was more effective than the higher dose (given over 5 days). The investigators conclude that the duration of treatment, rather than the dose, is the determinant of cure rate (<LINK REF="STD-Karbwang-THI-92" TYPE="STUDY">Karbwang THI 92</LINK>), however, this is based on a very small number of patients and two variables (dose and duration) differ between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>Mild and transient pain at the injection site was noted in both groups in one artemether study. Mild gastrointestinal events were similar in all treatment groups in all studies, and no adverse effects on the heart or differences in haematological or metabolic parameters were noted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons of same drug, different route</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared intramuscular and intravenous artesunate.</P>
<P>No difference in deaths was shown in either study; both are small studies and although the pooled estimate tends towards favouring the intramuscular route, this comes from the one study with unbalanced arms (<LINK REF="STD-Vinh-VNM-92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">Vinh VNM 92-4</LINK>, as discussed under comparisons between derivatives). Both studies included cerebral and non-cerebral malaria patients, but did not report mortality separately for these groups. Neither study reported neurological sequelae.</P>
<P>Both studies showed no significant difference between intramuscular and intravenous routes in any of the clinical or laboratory measures of therapeutic response. The small study by Hien (<LINK REF="STD-Hien-VNM-91" TYPE="STUDY">Hien VNM 91</LINK>) reported no local or systemic adverse effects, Vinh did not report on adverse events.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 09:26:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strength of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Despite the volume of clinical research, variation in patient populations, regimen comparisons, and quality of study design makes data synthesis problematic. Variation in the way in which outcome data are reported and lack of information on patient attrition precludes comprehensive metanalysis of all the evidence available. This is a great pity as fundamental clinical questions still do not have clear answers. The most recent overview of primary research this field can be found in: Medecine Tropicale 1998;58(3 suppl) The rational use of qinghaosu and its derivatives.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Artemisinin drugs compared with quinine</HEADING>
<P>The majority of studies in severe malaria have been comparisons of artemisinin drugs, mostly artemether, with standard treatment quinine. Over 2600 patients in thirteen such studies are included in this review so far; 85% (2261/2653) of these patients were treated in trials which reported adequate concealment of allocation. One study was only partly pseudorandomised (alternate allocation): the investigators stopped using artesunate part-way through their study as they were concerned that the preparation was not sterile. However, they continued recruiting patients which means that, whilst the quinine-artemether comparison in this study was randomised, the quinine-artesunate comparison had a randomised element, and a sequential non-randomised element of only quinine patients. The investigators attempted to clarify the design of their study (Kyaw Win, personal communication) which we decided to include, although there is still some doubt as to how many quinine patients were truly randomised.</P>
<P>Metanalysis of mortality, the most important outcome, in this review indicates that a patient treated with an artemisinin drug might have a better chance of survival than a patient treated with quinine. Although the direction of effect is fairly consistent across trials, the statistical significance of the pooled result is sensitive to exclusion of trials with insufficient methods (or reporting) of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The evidence on coma recovery time and neurological sequelae is not strong or conclusive. Survival analysis is the most appropriate statistical approach to analysing 'time-to' data, and only four studies reported using it. The studies that used other methods, either did not specify what this was, or were not explicit about the number of patients evaluated. Our metanalysis of neurological sequelae "at recovery" may be flawed because we had to make some assumptions about when these were assessed. Furthermore, the extent to which reporting of neurological sequelae varies between studies suggests that investigators are using different criteria to define these deficiencies and their clinical significance. Most of the included studies also had insufficient follow-up, in time or numbers of patients, to assess persistent neurological morbidity.</P>
<P>Time to clearance of fever and parasitaemia are of secondary importance in severe malaria. Here we had the same problem with 'time-to' data discussed above. It is important to note that almost all studies mentioned using mechanical methods (such as tepid sponging, fanning) or antipyretic drugs, such as paracetamol, to reduce fever as necessary, yet none discuss how this was distributed across the treatment groups or the effect it may have had on the reported fever clearance times. An overview of the included comparisons with quinine supports the well established observation that artemisinin drugs clear parasites from the blood faster.</P>
<P>Subsequent to this review, the Artemether-Quinine Meta-analysis Study Group conducted an individual patient data metanalysis of artemether versus quinine using data from the large well-conducted trials included in this review. Their results were similar to ours and they concluded that artemether is a good alternative to quinine for treating severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-IPD-99" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPD 99</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons between artemisinin drugs</HEADING>
<P>Randomised trials comparing different artemisinin derivatives, doses or routes of administration in severe malaria are few and treatment regimens vary widely. It is clear that there is no general agreement on the conditions under which these drugs should be compared. Investigators, between 1989 and 1996, appear to have conducted small trials in isolation. Each individual study is too small to be conclusive, and the variation between them precludes meaningful metanalysis.</P>
<P>A funnel plot of the primary outcome measure against trial size indicated that publication bias may have influenced the findings of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Applicability</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Location</HEADING>
<P>Data included in this review are gathered from diverse malarious regions of the world. The results do not indicate important variation that might limit applicability to certain geographical areas. However, resistance to quinine varies from region to region, being particularly high in some areas of South East Asia, whereas resistance to artemisinin drugs has not been conclusively demonstrated in clinical practice. It is logical to expect that the relatively new artemisinin drugs will be better at killing malaria parasites than quinine, and for the margin of benefit to be wider in areas where resistance to quinine is high. Monitoring of marginal benefit is warranted as artemisinin drugs become more widely available and subject to unregulated use.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Population</HEADING>
<P>In this review, the least tendency to favour artemether compared with quinine is shown in the six African studies and the largest of the studies done in South East Asia. These studies account for all the children in the mortality metanalysis of artemisinin drugs versus quinine, which could indicate an age-effect.</P>
<P>Coma scores qualifying as cerebral malaria are inconsistent across the included studies. In cerebral malaria the pathological effects are thought to be related to sequestration of red blood cells containing mature parasites in small blood vessels of the brain. By the time this happens it could be, by that time, the pathological changes that cause death are irreversible in some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hien 1993</LINK>). Notably, only blood slide-positive patients were included in the studies included in this review. Other complications of severe malaria were reported with varying degrees of clarity, and few reports broke-down outcome data according to these subgroups. Since disease severity is a major determinant of outcome in severe malaria, uneven distribution of complications between treatment groups, despite randomisation, could have a profound effect on study results (NJ White, personal communication).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Product</HEADING>
<P>Many formulations of artemisinin drugs are currently available on the market, produced in developed and developing countries. Not all of these drugs has been subject to stringent regulation during development and we cannot assume that they are equivalent in potency or safety.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Regimen</HEADING>
<P>Differences in treatment regimens cannot be ruled out as a contributor to heterogeneity between trials in this review. These vary markedly, although three of the four largest artemether-quinine studies used the same, or similar, regimens.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review also varied considerably in the exclusion criteria cut-off time for previous intake of antimalarial drugs; residual levels of other drugs in the body can only be determined by analysis, and this issue is not clarified in some studies.</P>
<P>Sustained parasite clearance is affected, amongst other things, by longer-acting antimalarial drugs, such as mefloquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (e.g. Fansidar), given after completion of the artemisinin drug treatment course. This practice is based on earlier observations that recrudescence rates are high when artemisinin derivatives are used alone, and is substantiated by this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cost</HEADING>
<P>A full cost analysis of artemisinin drugs versus standard treatment is beyond the scope of this review, and can be done better by people developing clinical practice guidelines for national or regional implementation. An example, however, is useful. The preparation of artemether used in 5/9 comparisons with quinine included in this review is Paluther (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer) for intramuscular injection. The manufacturer has provided a total treatment cost comparison for this drug versus intravenous quinine in an African public hospital setting (Ivory Coast) in 1998:</P>
<P>Drug only:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Paluther (6x80mg IM) US$ 17.59</LI>
<LI>Quinine standard dose (1.5g/day IV x 3, then 12 tablets/day x 3) US$ 8.62</LI>
<LI>Quinine minimum dose (1.5g/day IV x 3, no oral treatment) US$ 3.43</LI>
</UL>
<P>Drug plus sterile material:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Paluther (as above) US$ 18.26</LI>
<LI>Quinine standard dose (as above) US$ 22.15</LI>
<LI>Quinine minimum dose (as above) US$ 10.20</LI>
</UL>
<P>Quinine is the cheaper drug by far, however, sterile solution for intravenous infusion greatly adds to its cost. Intramuscular quinine would compare even more favourably with Paluther in terms of cost. Local preparations of artemisinin drugs would be cheaper in developing countries than imported Paluther, although equivalent potency cannot be assumed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Benefit and risk</HEADING>
<P>From this review, we can say that there is some evidence that artemisinin drugs (bearing in mind that most of the evidence comes from artemether) may be better than quinine at preventing death from severe malaria. We are less sure about the risks of harm because evidence from randomised trials is lacking.</P>
<P>An overview of tolerability and safety data on artemisinin drugs gathered from randomised controled trials, non-randomised trials and studies without control groups, concluded that few side effects have been reported with these compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. Are treatment regimens with artemisinin drugs better than standard treatment regimens for severe and complicated malaria?</P>
<P>Artemisinin drugs are no worse than quinine in preventing death from severe malaria. Aggregate data suggests that at best one more life could be saved in every 25 patients (95% CI 16 to 65) treated with an artemisinin drug compared with quinine, however, this has to be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity between studies. Additional supportive care might be more essential to survival than the antimalarial drug in patients with complications of severe malaria, including cerebral malaria.</P>
<P>There is no evidence yet to suggest that early treatment in rural areas with suppositories is inappropriate, being more convenient than parenteral quinolines, whilst patients are being transferred to a higher grade health facility.</P>
<P>2. Do artemisinin drugs have a comparative advantage over other antimalarials in areas where comparator drug resistance is high?</P>
<P>There is a need to determine whether the superiority of artemisinin drugs over quinine is a reflection of reduced sensitivity to quinine.</P>
<P>3. Should artemisinin derivatives be combined de novo with longer-acting antimalarials in the treatment of severe and complicated malaria?</P>
<P>Combination with a longer-acting antimalarial drug such as mefloquine or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine does reduce the rate of recrudescence according to the available evidence, and could possibly slow development of resistance to artemisinin derivatives. However, the risk of enhanced neurological reactions with mefloquine following severe malaria needs to be considered (NJ White, personal communication).</P>
<P>4 and 5. Is any artemisinin derivative better than the others; what is the best formulation, dose and treatment regimen?</P>
<P>The best derivative, route of administration, dose and treatment regimen has not been established in randomised controlled trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-14 19:01:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis has been completed for the larger, well-conducted RCTs of artemether versus quinine included in this review. Ideally, all data that address a common clinical question should be analysed in such a thorough and collaborative way.</P>
<P>Most randomised comparisons with quinine have used artemether. In the light of the results of the IPD metanalysis of artemether versus quinine trials, a decision should now follow as to a) is more data on artemether needed? and b) what data?</P>
<P>Prolongation of coma with artemether (and more convulsions, <LINK REF="STD-vanHensbroekGAM92_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">vanHensbroekGAM92-4</LINK>) compared with quinine indicates a need for active investigation of neurological adverse effects of artemisinin derivatives in humans with cerebral malaria.</P>
<P>There are few data available on artemisinin and artesunate compared with standard treatment. Artesunate is being widely used, and artemisinin suppositories advocated.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Future trials</HEADING>
<P>Co-ordination of trials is desperately needed to standardise inclusion criteria, the definition of severe malaria, monitoring of trials and outcome measures. The lack of agreement between trials to date reflects particularly badly on this aspect of clinical research.</P>
<P>There is a need to clarify the important risk factors for death in severe malaria rather than using post hoc statistical analysis, and to stratify randomisation according to potentially important features.</P>
<P>Researchers have to make their data available if maximum use is to be made of all the existing evidence in order to make an informed decision on appropriate use of artemisinin derivatives in severe malaria.</P>
<P>There is still a need to identify inexpensive, easily administered antimalarial drugs and adjunct therapies that will substantially reduce the rate of death in severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1996</LINK>).</P>
