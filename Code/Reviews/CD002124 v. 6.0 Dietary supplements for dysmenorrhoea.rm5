<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence of the effect of dietary supplements (e.g. vitamins, minerals, herbs) on period pain (dysmenorrhoea).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Dietary supplements have been used in the treatment of period pain. It is important to explore their benefits and harms. We investigated the effectiveness of dietary supplements compared to other supplements, placebo, no treatment or conventional analgesics (pain relief) in women with either primary dysmenorrhoea (not related to any other diagnosis) or secondary dysmenorrhoea (related to other causes, such as endometriosis). The evidence is current to 23 March 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 27 randomised controlled trials (3101 women). Most participants were students in their late teens or early twenties with primary dysmenorrhoea. Most studies were conducted in Iran. Interventions included 12 different herbal medicines (chamomile, cinnamon, Damask rose, dill, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, guava, rhubarb, uzara, valerian, and zataria), and five non-herbal supplements (fish oil, melatonin, vitamins B1 and E, and zinc sulphate) in a variety of formulations and doses. Supplements were compared with other supplements, placebo, no treatment, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any dietary supplement for dysmenorrhoea, and evidence of safety was lacking. However, for several supplements there was some low quality evidence of effectiveness. Supplements for which there was some very limited evidence to suggest a potential benefit were fenugreek, ginger, valerian, zataria, zinc sulphate, fish oil, and vitamin B1.</P>
<P>There was no strong evidence of benefit for melatonin compared to placebo for dysmenorrhoea secondary to endometriosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was of low or very low quality for all comparisons. The main limitations were imprecision due to very small sample sizes, failure to report study methods, and inconsistency. For most comparisons there was only one included study, and very few included studies reported adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-04 10:04:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea refers to painful menstrual cramps and is a common gynaecological complaint. Conventional treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which both reduce myometrial activity (contractions of the uterus). A suggested alternative approach is dietary supplements. We used the term 'dietary supplement' to include herbs or other botanical, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and amino acids. We excluded traditional Chinese medicines.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-07 17:01:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched sources including the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO (all from inception to 23 March 2015), trial registries, and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-04 10:05:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary supplements for moderate or severe primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea. We excluded studies of women with an intrauterine device. Eligible comparators were other dietary supplements, placebo, no treatment, or conventional analgesia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-03-04 10:51:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently performed study selection, performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and adverse effects. We used a fixed-effect model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We presented data that were unsuitable for analysis either descriptively or in additional tables. We assessed the quality of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-16 17:00:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 27 RCTs (3101 women). Most included studies were conducted amongst cohorts of students with primary dysmenorrhoea in their late teens or early twenties. Twenty-two studies were conducted in Iran and the rest were performed in other middle-income countries. Only one study addressed secondary dysmenorrhoea. Interventions included 12 different herbal medicines (German chamomile (<I>Matricaria chamomilla, M recutita, Chamomilla recutita)</I>, cinnamon (<I>Cinnamomum zeylanicum, C. verum)</I>, Damask rose (<I>Rosa damascena), </I>dill (<I>Anethum graveolens</I>), fennel (<I>Foeniculum vulgare</I>), fenugreek (<I>Trigonella foenum-graecum</I>), ginger (<I>Zingiber officinale</I>), guava (<I>Psidium guajava</I>), rhubarb (<I>Rheum emodi</I>), uzara (<I>Xysmalobium undulatum</I>), valerian (<I>Valeriana officinalis</I>), and zataria (<I>Zataria multiflora</I>)) and five non-herbal supplements (fish oil, melatonin, vitamins B1 and E, and zinc sulphate) in a variety of formulations and doses.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-04 10:08:02 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea or painful menstruation is the most common gynaecological complaint in women. According to a recent review of 15 primary studies (19,010 women) published between 2002 and 2011, the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea varies widely with reports ranging from 16% to 91% in women of reproductive age, with 2% to 29% experiencing severe dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Ju-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ju 2014</LINK>). A higher prevalence of dysmenorrhoea was generally found in adolescent women, with estimates ranging from 20% to 90% (<LINK REF="REF-French-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2005</LINK>). A recent Australian study of senior high school girls, <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>, reported that 93% of 1803 teenagers had pain with menstruation and about 40% reported moderate or severe pain. Dysmenorrhoea interferes with life daily activities and reduces quality of life, with absence from school or work ranging from 13% to 51% (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK>). The wide variation in reported prevalences are likely due to a difference in study populations, study quality, and length of investigation.</P>
<P>Risk factors for the development of dysmenorrhoea include: younger age at menarche, longer duration of menstruation and heavier menstrual flow, irregular menstrual cycles, depression/anxiety, smoking, and alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-French-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osayande-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osayande 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is commonly defined using two subcategories (<LINK REF="REF-Lichten-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichten 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osayande-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osayande 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2010</LINK>). Menstrual pain without organic pathology is considered to be primary dysmenorrhoea, while secondary dysmenorrhoea is associated with an identifiable pathological condition, such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts. The initial onset of primary dysmenorrhoea is at around six to 12 months after menarche, when ovulatory cycles are established. Pain duration is commonly eight to 72 hours and the pain is usually associated with the onset of the menstrual flow. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhoea is more likely to occur years after the onset of menarche and can occur premenstrually as well as during menstruation. About 10% of adolescents and young adults with dysmenorrhoea have secondary dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Harel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harel 2006</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-04 10:13:50 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a range of treatment options available for women with dysmenorrhoea, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2) specific inhibitors, and complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) (<LINK REF="REF-French-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osayande-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osayande 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK>). The goal of treatment is to provide adequate relief of pain and symptoms.</P>
<P>Two Cochrane reviews have suggested the efficacy of conventional treatments (NSAIDs and OCPs) (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2010</LINK> found that NSAIDs were much more effective than placebo for pain relief in women with primary dysmenorrhoea (OR 4.50, 95% CI 3.85 to 5.27) but with an increased risk of adverse effects such as mild neurological (e.g. headache, drowsiness, dizziness) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, indigestion). COX-2 specific inhibitors are effective for dysmenorrhoea but these drugs have been withdrawn from use in many countries due to questions about the cardiovascular and cardioprotective safety (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many consumers are now seeking alternatives to conventional medicine. CAM use has become popular with both consumers and practitioners of conventional medicine. It is thought that up to 38% of adults use some form of CAM to treat a variety of diseases and conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane review, <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2008</LINK>, provides some support for the use of Chinese herbal medicine for primary dysmenorrhoea, but is limited by the low methodological quality of the included studies.<BR/>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-04 10:18:32 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane review focuses on dietary supplements and excludes traditional Chinese medicines as these are the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2008</LINK>). Dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, enzymes, and amino acid dietary substances intended to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients. Dietary supplements are often marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, soft gels, and gel caps (<LINK REF="REF-US-FDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">US FDA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dietary supplements are a type of CAM. Based on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in 2007, people in the USA spent USD 33.9 billion out-of-pocket on CAM over the previous 12 months. A total of 44% of all out-of-pocket costs for CAM, or about USD 14.8 billion, was spent on the purchase of non-vitamin, non-mineral, natural products (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nahin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nahin 2009</LINK>). Herbal and dietary therapies are especially popular as treatments for disorders such as dysmenorrhoea as they can be self-administered and are often easily available from health shops, pharmacies, and supermarkets. This ease of access, while in some ways beneficial, can in itself create problems with the control of dosage and quality and possible drug interactions (<LINK REF="REF-Cupp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cupp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winslow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winslow 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A small RCT that investigated the effects of different dietary levels of calcium and manganese showed that an increase in calcium intake reduced the mood and pain symptoms associated with menstruation (<LINK REF="REF-Penland-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penland 1993</LINK>). Another finding was that low dietary manganese increased mood and pain symptoms during the premenstrual phase (<LINK REF="REF-Penland-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penland 1993</LINK>). An open trial of magnesium as treatment for dysmenorrhoea reported that the menstrual cycles experienced with supplement intake had greatly reduced symptoms compared with the pretreatment control cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Benassi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benassi 1992</LINK>). Additional evidence from <LINK REF="REF-French-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2005 </LINK>and <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2006</LINK> suggested that thiamine, vitamin E, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a Japanese herb (Toki-shakuyaku) may be effective compared to placebo.</P>

<P>All studies reported pain as the primary outcome. Continuous measures included a VAS scale 0 to 10 (0 is pain-free, 10 is unbearable pain) and a 0 to 3 scale. Dichotomous measures included rate of improvement. Where studies failed to report data that we could analyse, we included their data in an additional table or reported P values (where available) in the text.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-08 16:32:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>For treating primary dysmenorrhoea, there was no evidence of effectiveness for vitamin E, and no consistent evidence of effectiveness for dill, guava, or fennel. There was very limited evidence of effectiveness for fenugreek, fish oil, fish oil plus vitamin B1, ginger, valerian, vitamin B1 alone, zataria, and zinc sulphate.</P>
<P>When supplements were compared to NSAIDs, there was no evidence of a difference between dill, fennel, guava, rhubarb, and valerian and NSAIDs. There was no consistent evidence of a difference between Damask rose and NSAIDs, but there was some very limited evidence that chamomile was more effective than NSAIDs.</P>
<P>When we compared supplements head-to-head, there was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between ginger and zinc sulphate, but vitamin B1 may be more effective than fish oil.</P>
<P>For treating dysmenorrhoea secondary to endometriosis, there was no strong evidence of benefit for melatonin.</P>
<P>With respect to the safety of supplements, only four of the 27 included studies reported adverse effects in both treatment groups. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups but data were too scanty to reach any conclusions about safety.<BR/>
</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-08 11:01:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Few data were available for any of our comparisons of interest and most analyses included only one small study. Very few studies made head-to-head comparisons of dietary supplements and most failed to systematically report adverse effects. Only one study assessed secondary dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Schwertner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schwertner 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most included trials of primary dysmenorrhoea recruited university students and all included studies were conducted in low and middle-income countries, predominantly in Iran. The applicability of the evidence to women in other contexts is uncertain.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-04 14:03:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence was of low or very low quality. The main limitations were imprecision due to very small sample sizes, failure to report study methods, and inconsistency. For most comparisons there was only one included study, and very few studies reported adverse effects. The studies were heterogeneous with respect to the type of intervention and the timing of the intervention, and we could not pool data for most analyses. The overall quality of the evidence presented in this Cochrane review, as assessed by the GRADE approach, was low or very low for all comparisons.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-03-04 14:05:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to identify and include all eligible studies. However, despite our attempts to contact study authors, references to some studies proved irretrievable and for others we were unable to ascertain whether the participants' level of pain severity met our criteria.</P>
<P>We excluded Chinese herbal medicines from this Cochrane review, as this intervention is covered in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2008</LINK>). However it is difficult to draw a firm boundary between CAM interventions, and we have included in this review two studies of ginger powder, which is commonly used in China.</P>
<P>Several studies required translation from Persian. One (Persian-speaking) review author extracted the data from these studies, which we did not double-check.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-04 14:06:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Terry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terry 2011</LINK>, investigated the effect of ginger for treating pain. However, as it did not include any RCTs, comparisons with this current review do not appear relevant. Another systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Mirabi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirabi 2014</LINK>, included RCTs of medicinal herbs for dysmenorrhoea. In common with this current review, <LINK REF="REF-Mirabi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirabi 2014</LINK> found promising evidence for the use of medicinal herbs, but noted that the evidence was limited by methodological flaws.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-16 17:03:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any dietary supplement for dysmenorrhoea, and evidence of safety is lacking. However for several supplements there was some low quality evidence of effectiveness and more research is justified.</P>
<P>Participants in the included studies may be unrepresentative of all populations of women with dysmenorrhoea. Also, data were too scanty to reach any conclusions about the safety of supplements. Therefore the results of this Cochrane review should be viewed with caution.</P>
