<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:12:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to the loss of certain groups of nerves in the brain, which results in the lack of a chemical called dopamine. Currently, there are several different treatments available for people with newly diagnosed Parkinson's including levodopa (Sinemet or Madopar) which is converted into dopamine in the brain, dopamine agonists (for example, ropinirole and pramipexole) which mimic the action of dopamine, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (selegiline or rasagiline) which reduce the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. Each of these types of drugs has theoretical advantages and disadvantages. For example, although a very good treatment, levodopa can cause involuntary movements (dyskinesia), painful cramps (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose (motor fluctuations) after a while, whilst MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists may reduce the risk of these complications but are not so good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's. At present, therefore, it is not clear which of these three groups of drugs should be prescribed when people with early Parkinson's first need treatment. We reviewed the trials that compared giving MAO-B inhibitors with other types of medication in people with early Parkinson's to see if there was good evidence that MAO-B inhibitors were the best treatment to offer. However, unfortunately we only identified two trials (593 patients) so there was only limited evidence. The results showed that MAO-B inhibitors were less good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's than either levodopa or dopamine agonists but that they may reduce motor fluctuations compared with levodopa, though not compared with dopamine agonists. MAO-B inhibitors did, however, have fewer major side effects than some dopamine agonists.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-25 13:44:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>It has been postulated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors alter disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but trials have produced conflicting results.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-02-25 13:45:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of MAO-B inhibitors compared with other dopaminergic agents in early PD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:05:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>We searched several electronic databases including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009). We also handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-25 13:45:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO-B inhibitor with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in patients with early PD, where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Additional data were provided by the original authors. Random-effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:26:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Only two eligible trials were included (593 patients), both of reasonable quality although one was unblinded. Both trials compared selegiline with a dopamine agonist, whilst one also compared selegiline with levodopa. MAO-B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase or decrease in deaths compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.76) or dopamine agonists (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45). Those receiving MAO-B inhibitors were more likely to require add-on therapy during follow-up than those receiving levodopa (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31) or dopamine agonist (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81). There was a reduction in motor fluctuations with MAO-B inhibitors compared with levodopa (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94) but not dopamine agonists (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common with MAO-B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:10:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>MAO-B inhibitors are one option for the early treatment of PD although they have weaker symptomatic effects than levodopa and dopamine agonists. They may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy and may have fewer significant adverse effects than the older agonists but data are too few to provide reliable conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:11:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Since its introduction in the 1960s, the mainstay of treatment for early Parkinson's disease has been levodopa, a dopamine precursor which replenishes the depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia and alleviates many of the condition's symptoms and signs (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1997</LINK>). However, after several years of treatment with levodopa, many patients develop unpleasant and potentially disabling motor fluctuations ('wearing-off' and 'on-off' phenomena) and dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements). These adverse effects occur in approximately 40% of patients after five years of levodopa treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlskog-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlskog 2001</LINK>) and are more common in patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1998</LINK>). This and the fact that levodopa probably does not alter the underlying disease progression have led researchers to look for alternative treatments that actually delay the pathogenesis of the disease and cause fewer long-term side-effects.</P>
<P>Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors block one of the enzymes that breaks down dopamine in the brain and so enhance dopamine's effects. Interest in their use in early Parkinson's disease arose from a retrospective observational study, which showed improved survival of patients with Parkinson's disease treated with the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (<LINK REF="REF-Birkmayer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birkmayer 1985</LINK>). Around the same time, a group of Californian heroin addicts developed severe parkinsonism due to a heroin contaminant, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), that was metabolised by MAO-B to a substance that was toxic to dopaminergic neurones (<LINK REF="REF-Langston-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langston 1983</LINK>). MAO-B inhibitors were shown to protect against MPTP toxicity in animal models of Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkila-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkila 1984</LINK>). It has, therefore, been proposed that a similar mechanism of neurotoxicity may exist in Parkinson's disease due to an as yet unidentified environmental toxin against which MAO-B inhibitors may be effective. Furthermore, MAO-B inhibitors may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease by reduction of oxidative stress in dopaminergic neurones (<LINK REF="REF-Olanow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olanow 1996</LINK>) and some inhibitors may have anti-apoptotic effects that are independent of inhibition of MAO-B (<LINK REF="REF-Maruyama-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruyama 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The potential benefit of the early use of MAO-B inhibitors was supported by trials that showed a delay in the need for levodopa in patients started on selegiline (<LINK REF="REF-PSG-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSG 1989</LINK>). It was initially thought that this was because selegiline delayed disease progression but subsequently it was thought to be simply due to a symptomatic response from the weak dopaminergic activity of selegiline (<LINK REF="REF-Calne-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calne 1995</LINK>). The pendulum swung against the early use of MAO-B inhibitors following the publication of another trial that showed worse survival with selegiline (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 1995</LINK>), though this may have been a chance effect (<LINK REF="REF-Breteler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breteler 1998</LINK>). More recently, the potential neuroprotective effect of MAO-B inhibitors was raised again when a delayed-start randomised controlled trial of rasagiline showed continued benefit of rasagiline at one year despite trying to control for its symptomatic effect (<LINK REF="REF-TEMPO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">TEMPO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent meta-analysis of all MAO-B inhibitor trials in early Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ives-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ives 2004</LINK>) found that MAO-B inhibitors were not associated with worse survival. Moreover, it showed that MAO-B inhibitors may have a role in treating people with early disease, not only because of their weak symptomatic effect but also because they may reduce the development of later motor fluctuations. We subsequently published a Cochrane review with slightly different inclusion criteria, only looking at trials comparing treatment with MAO-B inhibitors for at least one year with control in early Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Macleod-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macleod 2005</LINK>), and showed similar results. We have now reviewed the long-term trials comparing MAO-B inhibitors with other dopaminergic agents in early Parkinson's disease.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the efficacy and safety of starting long-term treatment with MAO-B inhibitors compared to other dopaminergic agents in patients with early Parkinson's disease. </P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:12:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all truly randomised, properly concealed, controlled trials comparing MAO-B inhibitors with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in early Parkinson's disease. Studies in which the method of randomisation or concealment was unknown were included. Cross-over studies were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included patients with early Parkinson's disease (Hoehn-Yahr stage 3 or less), who were starting treatment for the first time or who had only recently started treatment (less than 12 months on treatment). Trials including a significant proportion of patients with motor fluctuations (greater than 10%) were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:17:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>We included long-term (treatment and follow up at least one year) trials comparing any dose of any MAO-B inhibitor (currently selegiline, rasagiline or lazabemide) with other dopaminergic agents (currently levodopa or dopamine agonists). Other treatment had to be the same in both arms. We included trials in which additional levodopa or dopamine agonists were introduced to either arm according to clinical need as the disease progressed. Trials of less than one year's duration were excluded because we were interested in the long-term effects of treatment rather than short-term symptomatic effects.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<OL>
<LI>To evaluate the effectiveness of MAO-B inhibitors we collected data on the following outcome measures in each treatment group at the final available follow up.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Number of patients who were dead or disabled (i.e. needed help with activities of daily living) from any cause (e.g. disease progression, motor complications or dyskinesias).</LI>
<LI>Number of deaths.</LI>
<LI>Disease progression in terms of:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>severity of parkinsonian impairment, disability and quality of life provided that data were given for the same point in time and the same clinical condition (i.e. on or off medication) in the two arms of the trial;</LI>
<LI>levodopa requirements: mean levodopa dose (or levodopa equivalent dose if dopamine agonists were used) and numbers of patients requiring supplemental levodopa or dopamine agonists;</LI>
<LI>time to introduction of additional dopaminergic treatment with either levodopa or dopamine agonist.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Number of patients with motor fluctuations including wearing off, on-off fluctuations and early morning dystonia.</LI>
<LI>Number of patients with dyskinesias.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>To assess the safety of MAO-B inhibitors, we collected data on the following outcome measures in each treatment group at final follow up.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>The number of patients with adverse events, such as nausea, postural hypotension and neuropsychiatric effects.</LI>
<LI>The total number of withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>The number of withdrawals due to adverse effects</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>If sufficient trials recorded outcomes at the same point in time (for example at one year) we planned to analyse outcomes at that time point. However, this proved not to be the case. The primary outcome measure was the number of people who were dead or disabled since this assessed the overall effect of treatment on a clinically important outcome, which would capture any delay in disease progression or prevention of severe motor complications with treatment, but also took into account any increase in death rate.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:12:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Two review authors (RC, CC) independently assessed titles and abstracts identified from the literature search. The full text of potentially relevant studies were obtained and the same authors independently evaluated the eligibility (on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and the methodological quality of these studies. Any discordance was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Methodological quality was assessed according to method of randomisation, blinding of treatment and outcome assessment, completeness of follow up and whether intention-to-treat analysis was carried out or was possible from the published data. We also assessed whether the treatment groups were comparable with regard to demographics, clinical characteristics and the number of patients excluded or lost to follow up within each trial and whether the definition of outcomes and entry and exclusion criteria were comparable across the different trials. Data extraction was subsequently performed and double checked by a second review author. We attempted to contact the authors of the studies for further details if any data were missing.</P>
<P>Formal meta-analysis, using the RevMan software, was performed where there was no substantial heterogeneity between the studies. Trials where MAO-B inhibitors were compared with levodopa were analysed separately from those in which the comparison was with dopamine agonists. Where we could not combine outcome data from different studies we have given a descriptive summary of the results. We calculated odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for the binary outcomes and, where the results were statistically significant, we planned to calculate the absolute risk reductions or increases for the range of baseline absolute risks reflected in the trials but there were too few data to do this. For continuous outcome scales (for example impairment or quality of life), where appropriate, we planned to calculate a mean weighted difference (or a standardised mean difference where different scales for the same outcome are used), but we found no such data.</P>
<P>For each outcome, the primary analysis was performed using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We found too few trials to attempt to identify possible causes for any significant heterogeneity through the planned subgroup analyses (see below), or to allow analysis of the effect of publication bias with a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). In the main analysis, participants were only included in the denominator for outcomes for which they were assessed. For positive results, we also assessed the effect of missing outcomes from patients excluded after randomisation by performing a best and worst case sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Subgroups based on the following factors were planned but not performed as there were too few trials.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Trial quality: high quality trials (truly randomised, well-concealed randomisation and double blind) versus those of lower quality.</LI>
<LI>Different MAO-B inhibitors.</LI>
<LI>Duration of follow up: trials with a follow-up period greater than five years versus those with follow-up less than five years.</LI>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-02-16 17:23:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Two randomised trials, with a total of 593 patients, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One of these studies has only been published in abstract form but unpublished data were provided by the chief investigator from a late interim analysis (<LINK REF="STD-PARJUPAR-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PARJUPAR 1996</LINK>). Summary details of these trials are given in the Characteristics of included studies table. Two studies (165 patients) were excluded (see Characteristics of excluded studies table). We are aware of one ongoing trial, the PDMED trial, which will qualify for inclusion in future updates of this review (see Characteristics of ongoing studies table).</P>
<P>Both included studies were restricted to those with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The mean age of those included was relatively young at about 60 years, most were in Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage I or II and there were slightly more men than women. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-PDSG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Italian PDSG 2001</LINK>) randomised patients into three groups: selegiline (up to 10mg per day), levodopa plus decarboxylase inhibitor (up to 600mg per day of levodopa), or a dopamine agonist (either bromocriptine up to 60mg per day or lisuride up to 6mg per day). Five year follow-up was initially planned but additional follow-up for mortality was also obtained at around seven years. Median follow-up for most other outcomes was 34 months. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-PARJUPAR-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PARJUPAR 1996</LINK>) randomised patients to receive selegiline 10mg, or bromocriptine titrated up to a maximum of 30mg or both. Data from the dual therapy arm were not included in this review. Patients underwent a maximum of three years follow-up, with a mean follow-up duration of 20 months. In both trials, levodopa could be added in the selegiline or agonist groups if required for symptomatic relief at the discretion of the treating neurologist. The primary outcomes were the development of motor complications ( <LINK REF="STD-Italian-PDSG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Italian PDSG 2001</LINK>) and the need for levodopa (<LINK REF="STD-PARJUPAR-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PARJUPAR 1996</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-02-16 17:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Both studies had well concealed methods of allocation but only one specified how the random sequence was generated (<LINK REF="STD-PARJUPAR-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PARJUPAR 1996</LINK>) and only one was blinded through the use of matching placebo medication (<LINK REF="STD-PARJUPAR-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PARJUPAR 1996</LINK>). Neither study used a true intention to treat analysis. In the Italian study (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-PDSG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Italian PDSG 2001</LINK>), twenty eight patients (5.6%) withdrew immediately after randomisation and were excluded from the analysis. The reasons for these withdrawals were not given. A further 16 patients were lost to follow up for mortality but not for the other outcomes. In the PARJUPAR study, although 165 patients were randomised in total to the three arms of the trial, 26 (15.8%) were excluded from analysis either because they had not reached the first assessment time when the data were analysed (n=20) or did not comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria (n=6). As it was not clear to which groups these participants were originally allocated, the actual numbers randomised to each group in PARJUPAR was unclear. A further 26 withdrew during the course of the study (11 from the selegiline arm, 15 from the bromocriptine arm), but were included in all analyses. In both trials, patients in each treatment arm were well matched for disease severity at baseline.</P>

<P>
<B>Number of patients who were dead or disabled at the end of follow-up</B>
<BR/>Neither trial reported data on this primary outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Number of deaths at the end of follow-up </B>(comparisons 1.1 and 2.1)<BR/>There was no difference in deaths between MAO-B inhibitors and levodopa (one trial, n=303, 91% of patients randomised in the trial, odds ratio [OR] 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52 to 1.76) nor between patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors compared with dopamine agonists (two trials, n=400, 92% of randomised patients, OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45).</P>
<P>
<B>Severity of parkinsonism </B>
<BR/>Neither trial reported useful long-term data on this outcome. Both reported change in the UPDRS score of parkinsonian impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Fahn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahn 1987</LINK>) from baseline to first follow-up visit, at two months in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-PDSG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Italian PDSG 2001</LINK>) and six months in the other (<LINK REF="STD-PARJUPAR-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PARJUPAR 1996</LINK>) but not for subsequent visits.</P>
<P>
<B>Numbers of patients requiring supplemental levodopa or dopamine agonists</B> (comparisons 1.2 and 2.2)<BR/>The Italian trial reported data on requirement for add-on therapy in MAO-B inhibitor and levodopa groups at end of follow-up from 311 patients (94% of randomised patients). Those in the MAO-B inhibitor arm were significantly more likely (63.9% vs. 12.8%) to require add-on therapy (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31; p value &lt;0.00001). This difference was retained during worst case sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Both trials reported the number of patients requiring add-on levodopa therapy at end of follow-up in MAO-B inhibitor and dopamine agonist groups. Data were available for 409 patients, 94% of those randomised. Those in the MAO-B inhibitor arm were significantly more likely to require added levodopa than those in the dopamine agonist arm (61.4% vs 42.0%, OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81; p value 0.04) with moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> value 51%). This difference became non significant with a worst case sensitivity analysis, in which the six missing randomised patients from the PARJUPAR study were allocated evenly between the two arms (OR 1.52, 0.81 to 2.85).</P>
<P>
<B>Mean levodopa dose</B>
<BR/>Neither trial reported data for this outcome</P>
<P>
<B>Time to introduction of additional dopaminergic treatment<BR/>
</B>The Italian trial, using data from 317 patients, reported a median time to addition of levodopa of 15 months in the MAO-B inhibitor arm and 30 months in the dopamine agonist arm. Using data from 92 patients, the PARJUPAR study reported a projected median time to the introduction of levodopa of 29.5 months for the MAO-B inhibitor arm and 26.4 months for the dopamine agonist arm.</P>
<P>
<B>Number of patients with motor fluctuations</B> (comparisons 1.3 and 2.3)<BR/>Only the Italian PDSG study reported these data (n=473, 94% of those randomised), with fewer motor fluctuations in the MAO-B inhibitor arm than the levodopa arm (18.7% vs 29.5%; OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94; p value 0.03) but this difference became non-significant in a worst case sensitivity analysis (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35). No difference was found between the MAO-B inhibitor and dopamine agonist arms at end of follow-up (18.7% vs 16.7%; OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05).</P>
<P>
<B>Number of patients with dyskinesias</B> (comparisons 1.4 and 2.4)<BR/>Only the Italian PDSG study reported this outcome (n=473, 94% of those randomised). No difference was found between the MAO-B inhibitor and either the levodopa arm (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.19) or the dopamine agonist arm (OR 1.50; 95% CI 0.84 to 2.68) at end of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>The total number of withdrawals</B> (comparisons 1.5 and 2.5)<BR/>In the Italian study, there were significantly more withdrawals amongst those in the MAO-B inhibitor arm than in those in the levodopa arm (332 patients; OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.30; p value 0.003), largely because of lack of efficacy with selegiline.</P>
<P>Comparing MAO-B inhibitor and dopamine agonist arms, data were available for 417 patients and showed significantly fewer withdrawals from the MAO-B inhibitor group (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.91; p value 0.02).</P>
<P>
<B>The number of withdrawals due to adverse effects</B> (comparisons 1.6 and 2.6)<BR/>The Italian study showed there was no significant difference in the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events in the MAO-B inhibitor and levodopa groups (1.2% vs 2.4%; OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.73).</P>
<P>Both studies reported fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in the MAO-B inhibitor group compared to the dopamine agonist group with a marginally significant combined result (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99; p value 0.05). However, there was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>value 80%), with a smaller difference in the PARJUPAR study.</P>
<P>One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-PDSG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Italian PDSG 2001</LINK>) reported the number of withdrawals due to nausea, which was more likely in the dopamine agonist arm (16.0%) than the MAO-B inhibitor arm (0%) (comparison 2.7; OR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.26; p value 0.004). There was no difference between the MAO-B inhibitor (0%) and levodopa arms (1.2%) (comparison 1.7; OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15).</P>
<P>
<B>The number of patients with adverse events </B>(comparisons 2.8 and 2.9)<BR/>Only the PARJUPAR study reported these data. A high proportion of patients in both the dopamine agonist arm (87%) and the MAO-B inhibitor arm (81%) reported adverse effects, with no significant difference between the two arms (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.00). Data were also given for those describing nausea: 13% in the dopamine agonist arm and 15% in the MAO-B inhibitor arm, again a non-significant difference (OR 1.14; 0.35 to 3.69).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-16 17:58:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>Only two trials comparing the long term effects of treatment with an MAO-B inhibitor with treatment with another dopaminergic agent in early PD could be found, and so our conclusions must necessarily be limited. In addition, both trials used selegiline as the MAO-B inhibitor and used older agonists (bromocriptine and lisuride) so the results may not be generalisable to the newer MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists.</P>
<P>Despite previous concerns, there was no evidence of increased mortality in those prescribed selegiline rather than other dopaminergic agents. This is in keeping with the results of previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Ives-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ives 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Macleod-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macleod 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few data on the relative efficacy of MAO-B inhibitors versus other dopaminergic therapy in terms of symptomatic control were available. The data on the need for extra treatment showed that MAO-B inhibitors were clearly worse than levodopa and also worse than dopamine agonists in this regard. This would be consistent with the clinical impressions of those who use these agents. The cause of the heterogeneity in this outcome between the two agonist studies is unclear but may reflect the lack of blinding in the Italian study, in which the need for additional treatment with selegiline was greater. Unblinded clinicians may have been more likely to prescribe add-on levodopa in those they knew to be taking what they perceived to be the weaker drug. Thus, this outcome may have been biased in favour of dopamine agonist. In the PARJUPAR study, while a greater proportion of those in the MAO-B inhibitor group required levodopa during the study, the median time to introduction of add-on therapy was reported as longer in the MAO-B inhibitor group. We suspect that this was because the MAO-B inhibitor arm had longer follow-up, but no data were available on this. Again, this is a potential source of bias in favour of dopamine agonist.</P>
<P>Despite poorer symptomatic control, the available data on motor complications suggest that there may be a role for MAO-B inhibitors in early disease. Selegiline appeared to delay the onset of motor fluctuations, but not dyskinesias, compared with levodopa, though the data were not robust when subjected to sensitivity analysis. This is consistent with the findings of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Macleod-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macleod 2005</LINK>), and may be a result of delayed introduction of levodopa in the MAO-B group. There is currently no clear evidence that MAO-B inhibitors are any better in this regard than dopamine agonists, but more data are required before any firm conclusion can be reached.</P>
<P>Fewer serious side-effects (particularly nausea) necessitating drug withdrawal were experienced with MAO-B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists, although there was some heterogeneity in the results. However, data were only available from trials using older agonists, bromocriptine and lisuride, which are now rarely used in the UK at least. It is unclear whether the higher rate of side-effects would remain if one of the newer dopamine agonists was used, although a Cochrane review of ropinirole versus bromocriptine (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>) and additional trials comparing ropinirole and pramipexole with bromocriptine (<LINK REF="REF-Guttman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guttman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korczyn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korczyn 1999</LINK>) have not consistently shown fewer side-effects with newer agonists than bromocriptine.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:16:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carl Counsell">
<P>MAO-B inhibitors are one option for early treatment of PD. They delay the need for levodopa, which may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy, though they may be no better in this role than dopamine agonists. They appear to have a weaker symptomatic effect than dopamine agonists but with fewer serious side-effects than the older agonists.</P>
<P>Therefore, whilst there is insufficient evidence to make any firm recommendations regarding routine use of MAO-B inhibitors as opposed to other dopaminergic agents in early Parkinson's disease, clinicians may wish to consider their use in situations where they feel it is important to delay or limit levodopa exposure, for example in young patients, whilst also minimising side-effects.</P>
