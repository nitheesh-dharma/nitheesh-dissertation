<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-10 22:21:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) is a fatal neurological disease which produces paralysis of the limb, swallowing and breathing muscles. There is no available treatment to stop or reverse its progressive course. In this review, we examine the evidence from four randomized clinical trials involving 1477 people with ALS. The methodological quality of the trials was acceptable and three of the trials were easily comparable (although one of them included older patients with more advanced ALS). The searches for this review were last updated in 2011, when we found no new randomized controlled trials. The results indicate that riluzole 100 mg probably prolongs median survival in people with ALS by two to three months and the safety of the drug is not a major concern. The evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that participants taking riluzole probably survive longer than participants taking placebo. The beneficial effects are very modest and the drug is expensive. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. Adverse effects from riluzole are relatively minor and for the most part reversible after stopping the drug.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-10 22:20:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49% in the placebo and 58% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.31).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-16 12:17:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Robert G Miller">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease characterized by weakness in limb and bulbar muscles with atrophy, spasticity, weight loss and ultimately respiratory failure. The incidence is approximately 2 per 100,000 per annum, and it is estimated that there are about 25,000 prevalent patients in North America (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 1996</LINK>). The disease is virtually always fatal and approximately half of patients die within three to four years after the onset of symptomatic weakness. There is a combination of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron abnormalities, and relentless and nearly linear progression of impaired function in almost all patients.</P>
<P>The burden of disease upon patients, family members and caregivers is substantial with increasing cost associated with increasing disability and the need for assisted medical care. At present in ALS, disease-specific therapy can at best only slow disease progression and does not stabilize or improve the underlying disorder.</P>
<P>There have been many controlled clinical trials of disease-specific therapy for ALS. Until the mid 1990s, all were negative. Emerging evidence that chronic glutamate excitotoxicity may accumulate to toxic levels and contribute to neuronal death in ALS provided a rational basis for undertaking a clinical trial with riluzole, a drug with complex effects, but which appears to block the presynaptic release of glutamate (<LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 1996</LINK>). The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated a modest increase in survival in treated participants compared to placebo controls (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>). However, many questions were raised by this study, especially in view of the disproportionate benefit observed in participants with onset of disease in bulbar (oropharyngeal) as opposed to limb muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>To address these concerns, a much larger dose-ranging study was carried out and again there was a small but statistically significant prolongation of survival in participants receiving the intermediate and high dose of riluzole (<LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>). A third trial was also carried out in France and Belgium involving people with more advanced ALS who did not qualify for the large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>). In this study, there was no significant survival advantage from riluzole. A fourth trial was carried out in Japan with multiple outcome measures that differed from the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK>). This study, which involved small numbers of participants and different end points, was negative. The results from this trial are included in this review although the difference in outcomes and the lack of survival-specific data prevented us from including it in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Subsequently, the drug was approved in the USA and just recently in Australia and Canada and in a many European countries.</P>
<P>A number of concerns about the therapeutic effect persist: the lack of benefit observed for some secondary measures of efficacy, the modest prolongation of survival (on average a few months), and the relatively high cost of the drug (approximately $10,000 per year in the US, and approximately £4056 per year in the UK). A Practice Advisory was issued in 1997 by the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology recommending that the drug should be offered to patients, but with some restrictions (<LINK REF="REF-Neurology-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neurology 1997</LINK>). Some published reviews have favored the use of riluzole, but their conclusions were not based on a systematic review of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Hugon-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugon 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hugon-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugon 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meininger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meininger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wokke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wokke 1996</LINK>). The Trent Institute report on purchasing did not recommend riluzole, expressing concern about cost effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Chilcott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilcott 1997</LINK>). A report from Wessex reached a similar conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Booth_x002d_Clibborn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth-Clibborn 1997</LINK>). The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) of the European Agency for the evaluation of additional products reported that riluzole had demonstrated a modest prolongation of survival (<LINK REF="REF-CPMP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPMP 1999</LINK>). Their report indicated that there was adequate evidence of efficacy of riluzole and a satisfactory benefit profile to recommend marketing authorization. The National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness recommended riluzole use in the UK, based upon the systematic review from the Midlands Group as well as input from experts and user groups (<LINK REF="REF-HTA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HTA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>). Recently an evidence-based practice parameter issued by the American Academy of Neurology, which updated the Practice Advisory of 1997, recommended riluzole to slow disease progression for patients with ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2009</LINK>). The present review was initially published in the Cochrane Library including only the first two clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>) and subsequently we fully included a third trial in the analysis with partial data from a fourth. We identified no new trials for this update.</P>
<P>The goal of the present review is to examine systematically all evidence from RCTs relating to the effects of riluzole in ALS, in order to supply the best evidence currently available on which to base clinical decision making and future research.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 April 2011) with 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' OR 'motor neuron disease' OR 'motor neurone' OR 'motoneurone disease' as the search terms. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2 in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2011). For the original version of the review we contacted the company (Aventis) and the authors of trials identified to find additional published or unpublished data and to clarify issues concerning trial design and loss of patients to follow up. We also obtained the reviews of the Food and Drug Administration, the Trent Institute (UK) (<LINK REF="REF-Chilcott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilcott 1997</LINK>), the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (UK) (<LINK REF="REF-CPMP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPMP 1999</LINK>), <LINK REF="REF-Booth_x002d_Clibborn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth-Clibborn 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chilcott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilcott 1997</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-HTA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HTA 2001</LINK> and checked their references.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies according to methods in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The studies were graded in the following domains: adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data addressed, free of selective reporting and free of other bias. For 'other bias' we took into account, for example, baseline comparison of experimental groups and explicit diagnostic criteria. Studies were graded 'Low risk' when they were at low risk of bias, 'High risk' when the risk of bias was high and 'Unclear' when the criterion did not apply or when the risk of bias was unknown, for example when there was too little information to make a judgment.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-02-10 22:06:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>For the primary outcome variable, we calculated an overall measure of treatment efficacy which combined survival results at different time points. This measure is based on estimating a pooled HR (i.e. risk of death for treated divided by risk of death for controls) for each study and then calculating a weighted average of the pooled HR for each study. The weights are inversely proportional to the variances of the natural logs of the pooled HRs. The methods are described in <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. We used life table methods to estimate survival at three-month intervals for each study and each dose of riluzole. We pooled data from different studies (and different doses) and applied life table methods to the pooled data to obtain summary survival curves for combined treated and for combined control participants across different studies and doses. We estimated median survival for treated and for control participants by interpolation from the survival curves. The only dose of riluzole that was included in all trials was 100 mg, therefore we chose this dose for the intervention comparisons as the primary outcome measure.<BR/>
<BR/>We also evaluated, as a secondary outcome measure chosen for this review, survival at 12 months, because it was the longest time point common to all studies. In addition, we created separate tables for each time point.</P>
<P>Tracheostomy was a surrogate endpoint for survival but there were no criteria which stipulated when tracheostomy should be performed. Timing of tracheostomy is a variable of patient care that may influence study outcome. Since a very small number of participants received tracheostomy, it appears unlikely that this influenced the results. The number of participants who had tracheostomy or intubation was low and balanced (riluzole versus placebo: 17 versus 16) when results from the two main studies were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>). The mortality, on the other hand, was clearly better in the riluzole group (124 deaths in the riluzole group and 156 deaths in the placebo group). Pulmonary function tests were measured infrequently (six month intervals) and were not well standardized.</P>
<P>Manual muscle testing was carried out using the Medical Research Council system (<LINK REF="REF-Lacomblez-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacomblez 1989</LINK>). Limb function and bulbar function were evaluated every two months with modified Norris Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Lacomblez-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacomblez 1989</LINK>). Quality of life was not measured but health status was assessed using a classification of five discrete health states which reflect increasing impairment in activities of daily living (<LINK REF="STD-Riviere-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riviere 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, including survival at individual time points, we calculated a weighted treatment effect (using a fixed-effect analysis) across trials using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>. We expressed results as RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed analysis on both short-term outcomes (adverse effects of riluzole, quality of life, strength and functional scale ratings) and long-term outcomes survival.</P>
<P>We tested for heterogeneity of the results across studies based on predicting the number of deaths at different time points from a pooled hazard compared with predictions based on estimating separate hazards for each study.</P>
<P>We examined the effects of known prognostic factors on survival (<LINK REF="REF-Stambler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stambler 1998</LINK>) including age, gender, anatomical site of onset, disease severity (forced vital capacity) and disease duration (defined as being from the onset of weakness to randomization).</P>

<P>The number of papers found by the new, current strategies were: MEDLINE = 259 (52 new papers), EMBASE = 128 (29 new papers), Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register = 36 (1 new paper), CENTRAL = 40.</P>
<P>Four studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Of these, two were included in the original version of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>) and two were added at a subsequent update (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK>). The review authors considered, but excluded, a total of twelve studies for possible eligibility, including one at this update (<LINK REF="STD-Meininger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meininger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only three of the four included trials contained full data on tracheostomy-free survival, these included results on a total of 876 riluzole-treated participants and 406 placebo-treated participants. The first was a smaller trial which compared riluzole 100 mg to placebo in 155 severely affected patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>). The second, a larger trial, was a dose ranging study comparing 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg riluzole with placebo in 959 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>). The third trial involved participants with more advanced disease (age &gt; 75, duration of illness &gt; 5 years, forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 60%) and compared riluzole 100 mg with placebo in 168 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>). The fourth trial involved 195 participants in Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK>), with inclusion criteria that were comparable to the first two trials. Unfortunately, full data on tracheostomy-free survival are not available from this trial. Despite repeated attempts, we have been unable to obtain comparable data on survival. Thus the trial was not included in the meta-analyses. The primary outcome measure in the Japanese trial was disease progression utilizing multiple measures including walking, arm function, tracheostomy, ventilation and tube feeding.</P>
<P>The reasons for exclusion were: seven studies were not RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Arriada_x002d_Mendicoa-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arriada-Mendicoa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Couratier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Couratier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Desiato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Desiato 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pongratz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pongratz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riviere-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riviere 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sojka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sojka 1997</LINK>); two did not compare riluzole to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Graf-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Graf 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 2000</LINK>); one study was an audit of outcomes in patients taking riluzole versus those not taking the drug (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2006</LINK>); one was a population-based comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Zoccolella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zoccolella 2007</LINK>); and for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Meininger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meininger 2004</LINK>) we were unable to obtain the key data for main outcomes. We included <LINK REF="STD-Meininger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meininger 2004</LINK> as a 'study awaiting classification' in the previous version of this review because the report did not provide complete data in terms of death at different time points for the placebo or riluzole groups. We requested from the authors more complete data about death and vital capacity changes over time, but as we were unable to obtain these data, we excluded the study in this 2011 update. However, the summary data are of interest and are briefly reviewed in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>

<P>In all four trials, participants were randomly assigned to receive riluzole or an identical appearing placebo and we considered the allocation concealment adequate. Participant as well as evaluator blinding was intended in both trials, but no information was provided to assess the effectiveness of patient or evaluator blinding.</P>
<P>Each trial used internationally accepted diagnostic criteria. All trials examined baseline demographic and clinical features, and there were no marked differences between placebo-treated and riluzole-treated participants at entry. In all trials, the study authors carried out a full intention-to-treat analysis, and all randomized participants were accounted for as dead or alive. In <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>, 24 participants were included although they did not entirely meet inclusion criteria (details not available). The participants were distributed evenly between groups (11 riluzole, 13 placebo) and probably had little impact on the results. No protocol violations were reported in the other two trials. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>, although the balance of clinical features was not different at baseline between the study groups, participants from France and Belgium were more severely affected at the start of the study than those from other regions. When these differences were adjusted for in the survival analysis, a beneficial treatment effect was still present. In <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>, disease severity in participants (% FVC, duration of illness, age and weight) was more marked compared to the other two trials.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment took into account random sequence generation, allocation concealment, patient blinding, observer blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other sources of bias such as explicit diagnostic criteria, explicit outcome criteria and how studies dealt with baseline differences of the groups. All studies explicitly stated their diagnostic criteria as being those of the World Federation of Neurology (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1994</LINK>), thus we considered all three trials at low risk of bias for this measure. With the exceptions of sequence generation in the Lacomblez trial, which we graded 'Unclear risk' and incomplete outcome data in <LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK>, which we assessed at 'High risk' of bias, we graded the studies at low risk of bias for all criteria. <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> summarises the review authors' risk of bias assessments.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome measure: pooled hazard ratio based on per cent mortality (or tracheostomy) for patients on riluzole 100 mg versus placebo from three trials over all time points</HEADING>
<P>Using methods for combining survival results from different studies (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>), we found riluzole 100 mg per day provided a slight benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (P = 0.042, HR 0.80, CI 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the 100 mg results of the two trials were pooled, the median survival was 15.5 months for treated participants and 13.2 months for placebo, a 2.3 month difference. When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P value = 0.046). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49% in the placebo and 58% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. The calculations are shown in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The graph at <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> shows the pooled analyses for survival. The pooled HR for the three trials decreased from zero to six months and then increased from six to 18 months (data not shown). An overall assessment, based on the HRs for the three trials at all time points, indicated a 16% reduction in the HR for those taking 100 mg riluzole, which was not quite statistically significant (P = 0.056). This represents a 10% absolute increase in the probability of surviving for one year (56% in the placebo group and 66% in the riluzole group).</P>

<P>In the earlier trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>, there was significantly lower per cent mortality in riluzole-treated participants than in placebo-treated participants at 12 months (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). In <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK> there was lower per cent mortality in riluzole-treated participants at 12 months (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.92). In <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>, there was no significant difference between riluzole-treated participants and placebo-treated participants (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.25). From a combined analysis of all three trials, there was a survival advantage (P = 0.004) with riluzole at 12 months with RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.92) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was evidence of heterogeneity in the results (worse survival in the third trial) attributable to the inclusion of participants with more advanced ALS in the later trial by Bensimon et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>. However, the combined results in terms of RR from all three trials were nearly the same as those based on the first two published trials. The HR for the combined data from all three studies was 0.78 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.92) at 12 months, compared to the RR for the combined data from the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK> (excluding the later trial <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>) which was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.86) at 12 months. Although the survival data show heterogeneity, there was virtually no impact of combining the studies on the overall RR results because of the relatively small size of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK> did not show a beneficial effect, but because of the small size of the trial, this result should not be interpreted as proving that there is no effect in patients with advanced ALS.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-10 22:10:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Robert G Miller">
<P>Four reports of randomized trials of riluzole in a total of 1477 people with ALS were available for this review. The fourth report from Japan was not sufficiently detailed to include in the meta-analysis. The methodological quality of these trials was judged as adequate by the reviewers. The therapeutic effects of riluzole at a 100 mg dose on survival were significant when the homogeneous group of participants in the first two trials were considered (P = 0.039). However, when all three trials are analyzed, there was heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001) due to the addition of more seriously affected and older patients, and the combined treatment effect fell just short of significance (P = 0.056). Thus, the difference in survival pooled over all participants at all time periods was not quite statistically significant, and the increase in median survival for the riluzole group was very modest (two to three months). Although the authors described a dose response in <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>, we agree with the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) that there is no statistically significant evidence for a dose response, and that the claim in <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK> is based on faulty statistics. The detailed statistical issues involved in the dose response analysis are discussed in the HTA report (<LINK REF="REF-HTA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HTA 2001</LINK>). Also, there was modest impact on functional measures. The studies were stratified to balance the number of participants with bulbar onset and limb onset in each treatment arm because of the important prognostic significance of this variable, with shorter survival on average in patients with bulbar onset. In the earlier study by <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>, the therapeutic effect was most prominent in participants with bulbar onset. In the trial by Lacomblez et al., there was no significant difference in therapeutic response between the bulbar- and limb-onset groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>, participants with bulbar onset had a worsening of mortality from riluzole. Overall, there was no correlation between site of onset and benefit from riluzole. In <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>, 24 patients were enrolled who did not meet inclusion criteria, constituting protocol violations. When these patients were dropped in a separate post hoc analysis, the therapeutic effect of riluzole was not statistically significant, possibly due to reduced power. In <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>, protocol violations were found in 35 participants (details not provided) and these participants were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Data on protocol violations were not available for <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was a significant beneficial effect of riluzole in two of four studies, although not at all time points. The survival data for the 100 mg dose of riluzole, the only dosage common to all studies, did not show significance in the early and late time periods, perhaps related to the diminished numbers of events and power in those time frames. When data from all doses of riluzole from three trials are combined, no comparison was significant, perhaps related to the very modest and non-significant beneficial effect of the 50 mg dose. The absolute risk reduction with the 100 mg dose at 12 months was 9%. Therefore the number-needed-to-treat to delay one death until after 12 months is 11.</P>
<P>In the 2006 revision of this review, we reported that riluzole 100 mg appears to prolong survival in patients with ALS by about two to three months which is somewhat shorter than that suggested in earlier versions of this review. This reduction in estimated survival prolongation occurred as a result of the inclusion of a study (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>), not included in earlier versions, which enrolled older patients with more advanced disease. Inclusion of such a study might a priori be expected to weaken the evidence of efficacy in terms of survival prolongation. Conversely, recent studies using large databases spanning five to 10 years have suggested that treatment with riluzole might be associated with a median survival prolongation of six months (<LINK REF="REF-Meininger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meininger 2000</LINK>), 10 months (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2006</LINK>) 14 months (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>), 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Traynor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traynor 2001</LINK>), or even 21 months (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2001</LINK>). A recent population-based study in Italy found a six-month overall survival benefit, that was significant in bulbar-onset and in elderly patients, but not in limb-onset patients (<LINK REF="STD-Zoccolella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zoccolella 2007</LINK>). It is not clear to what extent the greater reported efficacy of riluzole in these uncontrolled studies was influenced by other factors, such as riluzole users having less advanced or more slowly progressive disease than non-users, or differential use of interventions such as gastrostomy and non-invasive respiratory support. There is a trend for patients with more severe and rapidly progressive disease to avoid RCT, but the differences between trial and registry patients deserve further study (<LINK REF="REF-Logroscino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logroscino 2007</LINK>). These studies had the advantage of longer term follow-up than the RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensimon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>) and included participants treated earlier in the course of ALS, which may approximate routine clinical practice more closely, but the effects of uncontrolled potential confounders on survival could have biased the survival results.<BR/>
<BR/>Although the therapeutic effects of riluzole on survival were consistent in two of the three studies with comparable outcomes, the impact on functional measures varied among the studies. There was no positive effect on muscle strength when the data were combined. Small beneficial effects on patient function were found in the limb and bulbar scale at the 100 mg dose. The beneficial effect of drug on health status was derived from post hoc analysis of blinded data from the study by Lacomblez et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Riviere-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riviere 1998</LINK>). Participants treated with riluzole remained longer in a more moderately affected health state compared with placebo-treated participants. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, since no validation study of remaining in a specific health state has been carried out in ALS.<BR/>
<BR/>Although we were unable to obtain tracheostomy-free survival for <LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK>, an addendum to the HTA report indicated that some data were made available by Aventis. The HTA analysis including the <LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1997</LINK> data shifts the pooled HR result from 0.83 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.99) to 0.89 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="REF-HTA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HTA 2001</LINK>). The authors of the HTA report concluded that "the differences between these results are of no practical importance". They also stated that the impression of heterogeneity is strengthened. Thus the results from all four trials do not differ significantly from our previous review of the first three trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Future versions of this review should focus on survival at 12 and 18 months and also upon a pooled HR of all doses of riluzole upon survival. Future riluzole trials should include health-related quality of life measures as an outcome measure. Cost effectiveness calculations should also be included in the trial design since this is an expensive drug (approximately US $10,000 per year, although cheaper in the UK at approximately £4056 per year). Moreover, in future trials where survival is a primary outcome measure, the standards of care must be carefully delineated in the protocol because percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation appear to extend or prolong survival to a significant degree (<LINK REF="REF-Bourke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2009</LINK>). Future trials should focus more carefully on gathering pulmonary function data because of the critical role of respiratory function in prognosis. The ALSFRS-R should be utilized to assess functionality. Older and more advanced patients should also be studied to determine whether or not they receive the same benefit as younger, less advanced patients.</P>
<P>There were no serious adverse effects from riluzole in any study. Nausea and asthenia were the most frequently documented adverse events from riluzole treatment. Elevated liver function tests were also seen in patients treated with riluzole and support the clinical recommendations: (1) to undertake monthly liver function tests for the first three months and then at three month intervals thereafter, and (2) to avoid riluzole in patients with significant hepatic impairment.</P>
<P>Two recent phase III studies of xaliproden included a placebo arm in one study, and an arm of participants taking riluzole plus placebo in another (both reported in <LINK REF="STD-Meininger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meininger 2004</LINK>). There was no randomization as such between riluzole plus placebo and placebo. In one of the studies, xaliproden versus placebo was compared in an RCT where no participants took riluzole. In the other study, all participants were taking riluzole; and xaliproden plus riluzole was compared with placebo plus riluzole. Thus it was possible to compare one cohort treated with placebo alone in the first study, and another treated with riluzole plus placebo in the second study, all in the context of an identical protocol. These participants were all studied in the context of a placebo-controlled trial even though the main objective was evaluating xaliproden, not comparing riluzole with placebo. The enrolment criteria were the same as those used in the original riluzole trial and the two primary endpoints were: (1) time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation and; (2) time to vital capacity less than 50%, or permanent assisted ventilation, whichever occurred first. The participant characteristics were similar between the two studies except that participants taking riluzole had a longer disease duration (mean 25.7 months) compared to the placebo participants (mean 19.2 months).</P>
<P>A total of 692 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Meininger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meininger 2004</LINK> received no xaliproden: 286 participants received only placebo and 406 participants received riluzole alone. One hundred and thirty two participants reached the primary endpoint of death, tracheostomy or permanent ventilation in the placebo group (46.2%) compared with 153 participants in the riluzole group (37.7%) (P = 0.03 based on number of events, ignoring time to event. Survival analysis results, which take into account follow-up time, are not available in the published report). The longer disease duration in the group receiving riluzole, which may be due to more slowly progressive disease, may partially explain the trend to a lower mortality rate in the riluzole-treated participants, or it may have been a riluzole effect, or possibly due to both factors.</P>
<P>The percentage of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Meininger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meininger 2004</LINK> who reached vital capacity less than 50% was very similar in the riluzole group (45.8%) compared to the placebo group (46.6%), (P = 0.9 based on number of events, ignoring time to event and initial FVC values. More detailed data not available in the published report). The combination of time to failure of vital capacity less than 50% or death, tracheostomy, or mechanical ventilation dependency was also similar (57.9%) in the riluzole-treated group, compared with (62.1%) in the placebo group (P = 0.29 based on number of events). With both endpoints, there was a trend toward a benefit from riluzole but it was not convincing nor were sufficient data available to conduct more rigorous tests.</P>
<P>Similar results for riluzole can be obtained by comparing 1 and 2 mg doses of xaliproden in the arms with and without riluzole. For example, 119 of 293 (40.6%) of those taking 1 mg xaliproden without riluzole compared to 141 of 394 (35.8%) of those taking 1 mg xaliproden with riluzole reached the primary endpoint (P = 0.2 based on number of events). At the 2 mg xaliproden dose the comparison was 114/288 (39.6%) without riluzole versus 160/410 (39.0%) with riluzole (P = 0.88, again based on number of events rather than survival analysis).</P>
<P>In terms of safety, there was no significant increase in adverse events in the riluzole-treated participants compared with placebo. A number of reports of adverse events have accumulated as case reports, presenting as an acute hypersensitivity reaction. Individual cases of pancreatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2001</LINK>), hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Remy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remy 1999</LINK>), pneumonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Cassiman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassiman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borderias_x002d_Clau-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borderias-Clau 2006</LINK>), neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2004</LINK>) and one systemic inflammatory reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Sorenson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorenson 2008</LINK>) have been reported as likely secondary to riluzole, with improvement after stopping the drug.</P>
<P>Two trials involved add-on therapy to riluzole. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized parallel group clinical trial was conducted to determine whether vitamin E, 5000 mg/day, added to riluzole and compared with riluzole plus placebo might slow disease progression (<LINK REF="STD-Graf-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Graf 2005</LINK>). No difference between participants treated with vitamin E and placebo were detected and there were no significant safety concerns with megadose vitamin E during the study.</P>
<P>A randomized open study has been carried out to evaluate the efficacy of riluzole alone versus riluzole plus gabapentin in 50 people (23 males, 27 females) affected by ALS (<LINK REF="STD-Palma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 2000</LINK>). There was no significant benefit observed with gabapentin. Most ALS clinical trials now include riluzole treatment as standard care.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-16 12:46:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Riluzole 100 mg daily probably prolongs median survival by two to three months in patients with probable and definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with symptoms less than five years, forced vital capacity greater than 60% and aged less than 75 years. More studies are needed, especially to determine whether patients treated earlier or older, more advanced patients with longstanding disease derive the same benefit. Benefits are not apparent to individual patients.</P>
<P>The most frequent side effects are nausea and asthenia. Liver function becomes altered and requires monitoring.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials should examine the effect on quality of life, functionality (ALSFRS-R), and in different subgroups (for example, more severely affected and older compared with mildly affected and younger patients). Data from all clinical trials should be made available to the scientific community. Genotyping in future trials might be useful to analyze the heterogeneity of responses to therapy. </P>

<P>The first version of the review was jointly written by all four authors at that time. The lead author (RGM) coordinated the review, abstracted data from the papers, requested additional data from authors, entered the data into Revman and wrote the review. The co-reviewers (JDM, DHM) checked the data, appraised the quality of the studies (especially for allocation concealment) and offered revisions of the review. One co-reviewer is a statistician (DHM). He offered help and advice to the lead author at all stages, and performed the additional statistical analysis of survival at multiple time points not provided by Revman. One co-reviewer (ML) was a nurse and patient advocate and offered revisions of earlier versions of the review. This update was undertaken by RGM with statistical support from DHM. JDM provided substantive help with this update before his death in February 2011 but did not review all revisions.</P>
