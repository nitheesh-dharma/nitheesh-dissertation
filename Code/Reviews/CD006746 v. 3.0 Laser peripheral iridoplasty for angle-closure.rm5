<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-19 12:11:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Angle-closure glaucoma describes one of the mechanisms which leads to glaucoma. In angle-closure, the "angles" that act as drains for the aqueous in the eye are closed which leads to high eye ball pressure. Treatment is aimed at opening the drainage system and lowering the pressure in the eye with medical or surgical treatment or both. Laser peripheral iridoplasty is used in patients with angle-closure when other treatments fail to open the anterior drainage system. It works by shrinking and pulling the peripheral iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork (angles). Although one randomised controlled trial with 158 participants was found, due to its limitations and the lack of a statistically significant difference observed with laser peripheral iridoplasty intervention, this review found no strong evidence for the use of laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of angle-closure in the non-acute setting.</P>

<P>Angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment is aimed at opening the anterior chamber angle and lowering the IOP with medical and/or surgical treatment (e.g. trabeculectomy, lens extraction). Laser iridotomy works by eliminating pupillary block and widens the anterior chamber angle in the majority of patients. When laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle, laser iridoplasty may be recommended as one of the options in current standard treatment for angle-closure. Laser peripheral iridoplasty works by shrinking and pulling the peripheral iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork. Laser peripheral iridoplasty can be used for crisis of acute angle-closure and also in non-acute situations.  </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-12-14 12:50:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of narrow angles (i.e. primary angle-closure suspect), primary angle-closure (PAC) or primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in non-acute situations when compared with any other intervention.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-19 12:12:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment is aimed at opening the angles and lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye with medical or surgical treatment or both. Laser peripheral iridoplasty is used in patients with angle-closure when other treatments fail. It works by shrinking and pulling the peripheral iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork. This review found no strong evidence for the use of laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of angle-closure.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-12-15 11:25:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Glaucoma has been defined as a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic appearances of the optic discs and specific pattern of visual field defects. Based on the appearance of the anterior chamber angle it can be classified into open-angle or closed-angle glaucoma. In the latter, an elevated IOP occurs as a consequence of an obstruction of the outflow pathway located in the anterior chamber angle (i.e. trabecular meshwork) by the peripheral iris. Closure of the anterior chamber angle can be appositional (reversible) or synechial (permanent, due to adherent uveal tissue). Among patients with appositional closure of the anterior chamber angle, many have normal IOP without any signs of glaucoma. They are usually described as having &#8220;narrow angles&#8221; or &#8220;primary angle closure suspects&#8221; (PACs). If the IOP is elevated and/or there are parts of the angle with synechial closure (but without signs of glaucomatous damage), the preferred term is 'primary angle-closure' (PAC). The term 'primary angle-closure glaucoma' (PACG) is reserved for those patients with angle-closure and evidence of glaucomatous optic disc damage and/or visual field loss. In this review, angle-closure will refer to patients with narrow angles, PAC and PACG.</P>
<P>Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Sixty-seven million people worldwide are affected by glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is more common than PACG but the latter is more likely to result in bilateral blindness (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2004</LINK>). Primary angle-closure glaucoma is more common in Asians and women. Foster et al estimated that the number of persons with narrow angles in China, based on previous studies in Mongolia (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1996</LINK>) and Singapore (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2000</LINK>) is 28.2 million, while 9.1 million would have angle-closure. Furthermore, of the 1.7 million persons bilaterally blind from glaucoma in China, 91% are caused by PACG. Foster et al concluded that PACG might be the leading cause of glaucoma blindness in the world today (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with angle-closure may present with acute symptoms of highly elevated IOP but the majority of patients have a chronic course with no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Interventions for acute presentation of angle-closure are being evaluated in another Cochrane review and will not be considered in this review.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-06 13:51:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Argon laser is applied using a contact lens (e.g. Abraham contact lens) to the iris periphery, approximately six shots per quadrant. The argon laser is typically set at 500-micron spot size, with a duration of 0.5 seconds, and an initial starting laser energy of 50 to 200 mW. This laser energy level is gradually increased if iris stromal shrinkage is not observed initially. It has been suggested that heat shrinkage of collagen may be responsible for the short-term response to laser peripheral iridoplasty, and that contraction of the fibroblastic membrane may be responsible for its long-term effects (<LINK REF="REF-Sassani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sassani 1993</LINK>). Laser peripheral iridoplasty can be used as a primary treatment or after laser peripheral iridotomy for acute angle-closure attacks.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-06 13:52:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Treatment of angle-closure is aimed at (1) opening the anterior chamber angle, most commonly by laser iridotomy, and (2) lowering the IOP with medical and/or surgical treatment (e.g. trabeculectomy, lens extraction). Laser iridotomy works by eliminating pupillary block and widens the anterior chamber angle in the majority of patients, although in some of them the anterior chamber angle remains closed. The latter situation may be due to plateau iris syndrome or a prominent and thick peripheral iris. When laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle, laser peripheral iridoplasty may be recommended as one of the options in current standard treatment for angle-closure.</P>
<P>Laser peripheral iridoplasty tries to pull away and 'remove' iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork by shrinking the peripheral iris tissue.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-06 13:53:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Laser peripheral iridoplasty is part of the standard treatment for angle-closure and is indicated in patients who do not respond to laser iridotomy. The use of laser peripheral iridoplasty appears to be increasingly reported in the literature and among experts in specialist meetings (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lam-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinreb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinreb 2006</LINK>). So far, there has been no systematic review to assess the effectiveness of laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of eyes with angle-closure in non-acute situations.</P>

<P>We found one randomised controlled trial and two case series which assessed laser peripheral iridoplasty in angle-closure.

<P>The searches were designed to include a filter to identify RCTs. However, when the filter was applied the search retrieved very few references. We decided to run the searches without the filters to retrieve any type of study discussing the use of laser peripheral iridoplasty for the treatment of angle- closure glaucoma.</P>
<P>The electronic searches retrieved three references from <I>The Cochrane Library, </I>79 references from MEDLINE, 68 references from EMBASE and five references from LILACS. After deduplication the search identified a total of 96 references. The Trials Search Co-ordinator scanned the results and removed any references that were not relevant to the scope of the review. The authors then excluded twenty-seven references which assessed laser peripheral iridoplasty in acute angle-closure glaucoma. Only two studies reported its use in the non-acute setting but neither were RCTs nor case controlled studies. Hence, no trials were available for further analysis.</P>
<P>An update search was done in January 2012. After deduplication the search identified a total of 34 references. We assessed these references which were made up of eight abstracts from clinical trial registers and 26 abstracts from journals. The abstracts were independently assessed by two authors. We obtained a full-text copy of one paper by <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2010</LINK> for potential inclusion in the review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-12-15 19:10:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Literature surrounding the use of laser peripheral iridoplasty in non-acute angle-closure is scarce. There are relatively more studies reporting its efficacy in breaking attacks of angle-closure where it can be used<I> </I>in medically unbreakable attacks. However, in a recent consensus meeting among glaucoma experts (<LINK REF="REF-Weinreb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinreb 2006</LINK>) laser iridoplasty was considered a standard treatment in patients with persistent appositional angle-closure after peripheral iridotomy. </P>
<P>We have found only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2010</LINK>) which reports laser peripheral iridoplasty as an adjunct to laser peripheral iridotomy compared to iridotomy alone. The authors report no superiority in using iridoplasty as an adjunct to iridotomy for IOP, number of medications or need for surgery. However, they noted a significant reduction in peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) reduction post iridoplasty. The authors acknowledge that there were several limitations in their method of assessing PAS, which was with a Goldmann lens and not an indentation lens which indents better. The non-masking of the outcome assessors may also introduce some extent of bias to this very subjective assessment. This may have been overcome by the use of anterior segment imaging.</P>
<P>Difference in IOP between the groups may not have shown much of a difference due to the low study power as well as the short follow-up of only one year.</P>
<P>Despite the inherent limitations of this study, it is still a well designed RCT which adds value to the literature surrounding laser peripheral iridoplasty. Moreover, it is reassuring to see that there were no complications reported with laser peripheral iridoplasty or ill effects on the cornea or the corneal endothelial cell count.</P>
<P>Apart from <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2010</LINK>, two non-RCT studies were found to report the effectiveness of laser peripheral iridoplasty. Ritch et al carried out a retrospective case series involving 23 eyes of 14 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ritch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritch 2004</LINK>). They had a mean follow up of 78.9 months and found that in all patients the anterior chamber angle did open after treatment, and only three eyes needed repeat laser peripheral iridoplasty. They also suggested that it is a safe and effective procedure with a satisfactory long term success rate.</P>
<P>Lai et al recruited five patients with PACG and 360° peripheral anterior synechiae for inferior 180° goniosynechialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2000</LINK>). Laser peripheral iridoplasty was then applied on day four after surgery and the functional success rate (defined as having an IOP of less than 20 mmHg at last follow up) was observed in four patients. The authors suggested laser peripheral iridoplasty as an adjunct to goniosynechialysis for treatment of angle-closure with total synechial angle-closure. </P>
<P>Although at present there is no strong evidence for the use of laser peripheral iridoplasty alone in angle-closure, these studies and the consensus among experts suggest that it is worth conducting an RCT to determine its effectiveness in angle-closure treatment and not just as an adjunct.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-10 13:29:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>It has been proposed that laser peripheral iridoplasty may be effective in patients with angle-closure (non-acute setting) when laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle. However, there is currently no evidence for its role in the treatment of angle-closure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-12-19 13:05:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Future trials to evaluate the role of laser iridoplasty will need to include patients with residual angle-closure after peripheral iridotomy, with different spectrum of the disease (PACs, PAC, PACG). Laser iridoplasty should be compared with a control group without this intervention. A RCT would be the ideal study design. Comparison of argon laser iridoplasty with other interventions designed to open the anterior chamber angle (e.g. lens extraction) would also be of interest.  Description of the methods to examine the anterior chamber angle, before and after intervention, would be essential. If clinical examination is going to be used, masking and standardisation of grading would be important. The use of imaging techniques (such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) or ultrasound biomicroscopy) would complement qualitative evaluation of the anterior chamber angle and would be recommended. Mid and long-term effectiveness would be measured in terms of IOP, extension of anterior chamber angle-closure, visual field changes, visual acuity, and vision-related quality of life. Outcomes would need to be assessed by masked investigators. Standard ethical requirements would apply. </P>
