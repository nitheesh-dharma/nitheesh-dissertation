<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-22 16:09:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Does mitomycin C (MMC) offer any advantage in comparison to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) as the antimetabolite used to augment glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy)? Does MMC help to achieve lower rates of trabeculectomy failure than 5-FU at one year postoperatively?<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy) to help lower intraocular pressure. Antimetabolites are medicines used during surgery to help reduce scarring after surgery during wound healing. If scarring occurs it can lead to treatment failure because the drainage channel no longer works. Two agents in common use are MMC and 5-FU.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
<BR/>The evidence is up to date to October 2015.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We included 11 randomised controlled trials conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa in this review. In total, 687 eyes of 679 participants underwent routine trabeculectomy for glaucoma control. Some participants were at a higher risk of failure than others, for example if they had had previous glaucoma surgery, were of African origin, or if they had secondary glaucoma. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Our review showed that the risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was slightly less in those participants treated with MMC compared to 5-FU. All of the included randomised controlled trials contributed to this result, with a mixed study population of high- and low-risk participants and varied methodology of antimetabolite application. We did not detect any significant differences between the subgroups of participants at low and high risk of failure, but the power of this analysis was low.</P>
<P>We identified no difference between the visual outcomes of the group that received MMC and the group that received 5-FU at one year postoperatively nor in the number of drops used postoperatively. However, we found evidence to suggest that MMC was more effective at lowering intraocular pressure than 5-FU in both high- and low-risk participants, achieving a lower mean intraocular pressure postoperatively than in those who were treated with 5-FU at one year. This effect seemed to be greater in the high-risk populations.</P>
<P>Evaluating the overall complications across all studies revealed a slight favour toward using MMC, particularly with the incidence of epitheliopathy and hyphaema. There was a trend towards bleb leaks, wound leaks, late hypotony and cataract formation in the MMC-treated group.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>We graded the quality of the evidence as low, mostly due to the risk of bias in the included studies. One bias we commonly encountered came from the different techniques of antimetabolite administration, making it difficult to conceal which medicine was being used. Furthermore, most studies only had a few complications to report, which meant that there were low numbers overall to include in the analysis of complications.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-12 06:48:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials and collected data. The primary outcome was failure of a functioning trabeculectomy one year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included mean intraocular pressure at one year. We considered three subgroups: high risk of trabeculectomy failure (people with previous glaucoma surgery, extracapsular cataract surgery, African origin and people with secondary glaucoma or congenital glaucoma); medium risk of trabeculectomy failure (people undergoing trabeculectomy with extracapsular cataract surgery) and low risk of trabeculectomy failure (people who have received no previous surgical eye intervention).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-06 14:08:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 11 trials that enrolled 687 eyes of 679 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery.</P>
<P>We considered one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains, six studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains, and the remaining four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias in all domains.</P>
<P>The risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was less in those participants who received MMC compared to those who received 5-FU, however the confidence intervals were wide and are compatible with no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.00; studies = 11; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%). There was no evidence for any difference between groups at high and low risk of failure (test for subgroup differences P = 0.69).</P>
<P>On average, people treated with MMC had lower intraocular pressure at one year (mean difference (MD) -3.05 mmHg, 95% CI -4.60 to -1.50), but the studies were inconsistent (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%). The size of the effect was greater in the high-risk group (MD -4.18 mmHg, 95% CI -6.73 to -1.64) compared to the low-risk group (MD -1.72 mmHg, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.16), but again the test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.11).</P>
<P>Similar proportions of eyes treated with MMC lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity one year after surgery compared to 5-FU, but the confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.06).</P>
<P>Adverse events occurred relatively rarely, and estimates of effect were generally imprecise. There was some evidence for less epitheliopathy in the MMC group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47) and less hyphaema in the MMC group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.91).</P>
<P>None of the studies reported quality of life.</P>
<P>Overall, we graded the quality of the evidence as low largely because of risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the estimate of effect.</P>

<P>We found low-quality evidence that MMC may be more effective in achieving long-term lower intraocular pressure than 5-FU. Further comparative research on MMC and 5-FU is needed to enhance reliability and validity of the results shown in this review.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-12 07:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-12 07:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy characterised by a progressive loss of ganglion cells that leads to a characteristic visual function loss. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is often considered to be a major risk factor for glaucoma, and it is the only factor that can be modified to try to change the course of the condition. The publication of a series of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has established the evidence for treating glaucoma with IOP reduction (<LINK REF="REF-AGIS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGIS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTGS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kass-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maier-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maier 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vass-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vass 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glaucoma drainage surgery remains an important treatment option for the control of IOP despite the addition of several new IOP-lowering drugs. Some evidence suggests that trabeculectomy is more effective than either medicine or laser treatment alternatives (<LINK REF="REF-Migdal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migdal 1994</LINK>). However, a Cochrane systematic review from 2012 found that visual field deterioration up to five years is not significantly different whether treatment is initiated with medication or trabeculectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Optimum success rates are achieved when the eye has been exposed to no previous interventions, either surgical or medical, although this is not the usual situation in high-income countries. Risk factors for trabeculectomy failure are thought to be those that increase the scarring response and include previous exposure to topical medication, previous surgical manipulation of the conjunctiva or other injury, young age, African origin, a history of uveitis and neovascular glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-EGS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EGS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The diagnosis of glaucoma is made by the identification of a progressive optic neuropathy or a characteristic visual field defect. There are subgroups of glaucoma, primary open angle glaucoma being most common in European and African populations. A person with primary open angle glaucoma is often unaware of any symptoms until the late stages of the disease, making early diagnosis essential.<B>

</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-12 05:17:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment is usually initiated with topical treatment, and surgical options are considered if topical treatment fails to prevent progression of the disease. The trabeculectomy produces a guarded fistula between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space. There have been numerous modifications since its first description (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 1968</LINK>), including the use of antimetabolites to reduce fibroblast activity and postoperative scarring at the site of the scleral flap and the subconjunctival space.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-12 06:51:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Once trabeculectomy has been selected, the treatment decisions are whether to augment the surgery with antiscarring agents such as antimetabolites. Antimetabolites are applied to the surgical site to inhibit fibroblast activity and reduce postoperative scarring; the two agents commonly in use are mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Due to reported side effects such as increased risk of bleb leak, hypotony and endophthalmitis (<LINK REF="REF-DeBry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBry 2002</LINK>), there is concern that use of these agents should be restricted to high-risk cases only. A number of RCTs have reported the use of MMC (<LINK REF="REF-Andreanos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreanos 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Costa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martini-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martini 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1996</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review concluded that compared to placebo, MMC reduces mean IOP at 12 months in all groups of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 2010</LINK>). Apart from increase in cataract formation, there was insufficient power to detect any increase in other serious side effects. Postoperative 5-FU injections to augment trabeculectomy have also been assessed with RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-FFSSG-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">FFSSG 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenfeld-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenfeld 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ophir-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ophir 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruderman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruderman 1987</LINK>), and also confer an improvement in IOP control at one year compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2014</LINK>). Clinically, MMC and 5-FU can be applied intraoperatively on a sponge placed for one to five minutes between the conjunctiva and sclera at the start of the operation. Alternatively, 5-FU may be given as one or more postoperative subconjunctival injections. There is marked variation in the concentrations of both drugs used, the time of intraoperative application and the position and volume of postoperative injections.<BR/>

<P>The results of two Cochrane reviews comparing MMC, in <LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 2010</LINK>, and 5-FU, in <LINK REF="REF-Green-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2014</LINK>, to placebo suggest a similar effect for the two agents in inhibiting scarring after trabeculectomy. However, there is no direct comparative evidence to influence which antimetabolite a surgeon should choose.

<P>Three review authors (JC/EC/JE) independently assessed risk of bias according to methods set out in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We considered six domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, masking, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and any other identified bias. We graded each domain as low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias. For example, in allocation concealment the grading was low risk if there was central randomisation of subjects, high risk if there was simple alternating methods used to allocate subjects and unclear if there was no real qualifying statement. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors were not masked to trial details during the assessment. We excluded trials scoring 'high risk' on allocation concealment. In cases where missing or confusing data did not permit a clear grading of the trial, we contacted the study authors in order to obtain further information.</P>

<P>The risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was lower in those treated with MMC compared to 5-FU (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.00; studies = 11; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%). However, the confidence intervals of the studies were wide, and we cannot exclude important differences.</P>
<P>There was no evidence for any difference between groups at high and low risk of failure (test for subgroup differences P = 0.69), but with only a few trials in each group, the power of the analysis to detect any differences was low.</P>
<P>The dose of MMC varied across the studies included in the review, and consequently we performed a dose-response analysis. We identified a trend showing that studies increasingly favoured the use of MMC rather than 5-FU as the intraoperative exposure to MMC increased (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Overall exposure was calculated by multiplying the concentration of MMC by the duration of exposure for each study. We then listed the studies in descending order of MMC exposure to view the overall effect. We excluded one study that administered the MMC by subconjunctival injection from this analysis.</P>
<P>When considering the method of 5-FU administration as in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, there was no significant effect on the overall outcome whether the 5-FU was administered by postoperative subconjunctival injections or by the more current method of intraoperative sponge application (subgroup difference P = 0.93)</P>

<P>No trial reported this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mean IOP one year from surgery</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies reported mean IOP at 12 months (range 6 to 18 months). On average, people treated with MMC had lower IOP at one year (mean difference (MD) -3.05 mmHg, 95% CI -4.60 to -1.50) <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>. There was inconsistency between trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%), the MD showing a large range in the studies.</P>
<P>The size of the effect was greater in the high-risk group (MD -4.18 mmHg, 95% CI -6.73 to -1.64) compared to the low-risk group (MD -1.72 mmHg, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.16), but the test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.11).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Postoperative use of antiglaucoma medications</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies reported on the frequency of postoperative use of antiglaucoma medications. Similar proportions of people treated with MMC and 5-FU required postoperative medication to control pressure (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.85) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). There was no evidence for any difference in effect between high-risk and low-risk groups (P = 0.88). The low-risk group trials were consistent (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), but we saw different results in the three higher-risk group trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 74%).</P>
<P>Four studies reported the mean number of antiglaucoma medications used. On average, people receiving MMC used fewer antiglaucoma medications (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.05), but the effect was uncertain (CIs include 0.00), and the studies were inconsistent (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 71%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The inconsistency in the trials came from those with a higher risk of failure (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 62%). However, there was a difference between the trials including participants at high risk of failure and those including participants at low risk of failure with a greater relative effect of MMC in the higher-risk groups (test for interaction P = 0.06). The main caveat was that there were only two trials in each group of the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reduction in visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>Five studies reported postoperative visual acuity. The proportion of eyes treated with MMC that lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity one year after surgery was similar to that of 5-FU, but the CIs were wide (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.06) <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Bleb leak</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported bleb leak as a complication encountered following trabeculectomy. Participants receiving MMC were more likely to have a postoperative bleb leak, although the CI was wide, and only two studies reported this outcome (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.68; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>Six studies used the term 'wound leak' rather than 'bleb leak' in their assessment of postoperative complications. These studies also showed, with similar statistics, that participants receiving MMC were more likely to have a postoperative wound leak than those receiving 5-FU, although the CI was wide (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.71; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Late hypotony</HEADING>
<P>Five studies reported hypotony post-trabeculectomy. Participants receiving MMC were more likely to have postoperative hypotony compared to those participants who received 5-FU, however the effect was uncertain with wide CIs compatible with no effect or increased hypotony in the 5-FU group (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.63; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Maculopathy</HEADING>
<P>Four studies reported maculopathy following trabeculectomy. Participants receiving MMC were more likely to encounter maculopathy postoperatively than those receiving 5-FU, but the effect was uncertain and CI compatible with no effect or increased maculopathy in the 5-FU group (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.33; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cataract</HEADING>
<P>Four studies reported the incidence of postoperative cataract development. Participants receiving MMC were more likely to develop cataract than those receiving 5-FU, but again the CIs include 1 (null effect) (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.61; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 24%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Shallow anterior chamber</HEADING>
<P>Five studies noted postoperative shallowing of the anterior chamber. Those participants receiving MMC were more likely to present with a shallow anterior chamber than those who received 5-FU. The statistical analysis showed a wide CI (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.21; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Choroidal detachment</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies (549 eyes) reported a choroidal detachment as a postoperative complication following trabeculectomy. Three studies (303 eyes) reported the same event as a 'suprachoroidal haemorrhage'<I>. </I>The former group of studies found no difference in the rate of events between those participants who received MMC and those who received 5-FU (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.63; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The latter group of studies favoured those participants who received MMC, although the CI was wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.66; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 18%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epitheliopathy</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies (474 eyes) reported this complication following trabeculectomy. Those participants who received MMC were less likely to have an epitheliopathy following surgery than those who received 5-FU, which is most likely a result of the differences in the technique of antimetabolite application (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Tenon's cyst</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (232 eyes) reported Tenon's cysts in their postoperative complication analysis. Those participants who received MMC were less likely to have a Tenon's cyst following surgery, although the CI was wide (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.38; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hyphaema</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (250 eyes) documented postoperative hyphaema during their follow-up of participants. Participants who received MMC were less likely to have a postoperative hyphaema than those who received 5-FU, which may be a consequence of antimetabolite application differences (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.91; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Endophthalmitis</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (315 eyes) published rates of postoperative endophthalmitis. Participants receiving MMC were more likely to have endophthalmitis following trabeculectomy than those who received 5-FU. The CI was wide (RR 3.89, 95% CI 0.44 to 34.57; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses (excluding studies at high risk of bias)</HEADING>
<P>An interesting feature of these analyses was that the trials at high risk of bias were also the trials recruiting participants at high risk of failure. In general, excluding these studies improved the consistency (reduced I<SUP>2</SUP>). Although the estimate of effect changed in these analyses, in general the conclusions (of uncertainty in most cases) did not.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-19 12:18:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have summarised the results in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified 11 trials conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery.</P>
<P>We considered one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains, six studies at high risk of bias in one or more domains, and the remaining four studies at an unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Our review showed that the risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was lower in those participants treated with MMC compared to those treated with 5-FU. However, the estimate of effect was imprecise, and we cannot exclude important differences. All 11 RCTs contributed to this finding with an overall mixed study population and varied methodology of antimetabolite application. Although MMC appeared to have a greater success and more of an IOP-lowering effect in the higher-risk populations, we detected no significant difference between the subgroups of participants at low and high risk of failure in these analyses. We identified no difference between the visual outcomes of the people receiving MMC or 5-FU at one year postoperatively nor in the number of drops used postoperatively.</P>
<P>Evaluation of postoperative complications showed that there was a higher incidence of epitheliopathy and hyphaema when using 5-FU compared to MMC. However, we found those participants who received MMC to have more reported bleb leaks, wound leaks, late hypotony and cataract formation than those who received 5-FU. The quality of the evidence was low given that in general adverse outcomes were rare, and hence estimates of effect were imprecise. Although there were trends, any real significance cannot be determined from this review alone.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported quality of life.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-12 06:55:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is limited owing to the small numbers of and large variability between studies, for example in participant demographics, methodology, masking of participants and varied follow-up. Some of the included studies had only 20 or 30 participants in their study population, which contrasts with the largest study, which had 115 participants.</P>
<P>After many years of widespread use of antimetabolite agents, uncertainty remains about the relative benefits and harms of their use in trabeculectomy surgery. Newer agents and techniques may be developed and evaluated to then eventually take over the role of antimetabolites.</P>
<P>The majority of studies were carried out in the United States, although we included studies from European, Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries. Two of the included papers, one in Chinese and one in Italian, were translated. The analysis has taken into account the risk of failure of each study population and reported the risk as high or low. This is important when interpreting the results in a clinical setting in order to reflect the practice population. However, results showed a similar trend between high- and low-risk participants, which perhaps may be due to the inclusion of poor-quality evidence as discussed.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-19 12:19:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, we graded the quality of the evidence as low, in most cases because of risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the estimate of effect. One commonly encountered bias came from the difficulty in masking participants and surgeons owing to the different techniques of antimetabolite administration. All studies included in the review were RCTs, but the variability in outcome reporting reduced the quality of the evidence for some outcomes. Each study group reported few complications, which subsequently led to small numbers being incorporated into the analysis of complications.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Fendi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendi 2013</LINK> completed a meta-analysis that showed significantly higher success rates with the use of MMC when compared with 5-FU.

<P>This review provided low-quality evidence that to achieve lower IOP following trabeculectomy MMC may be a more effective antimetabolite than 5-FU across both high- and low-risk populations. The risk associated with using either MMC or 5-FU as an antimetabolite in a routine trabeculectomy was low given the infrequent reporting of adverse outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-12 05:17:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antimetabolites are a widely used adjunct in trabeculectomy surgery to help achieve lower postoperative IOP. However, the use of these medications may be associated with an increased risk of sight-threatening complications, predominantly due to the toxic effects on the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule.</P>
<P>Further comparative research on MMC and 5-FU would be required to enhance reliability and validity of the results shown in this review. However, the development of newer, safer agents to control wound healing in glaucoma surgery may be of more benefit to patients in the longer term. These future agents would require full evaluation with well-designed trials to become integrated into clinical practice, particularly through the inclusion of trials with higher power to detect minimally important clinical differences and to consider cost and patient-orientated outcomes.</P>

<P>We did not include outomes 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 in the protocol. Use of postoperative glaucoma medication is a surrogate for partial trabeculectomy failure and was measured as an outcome in several of the included studies. Visual acuity was another commonly reported outcome in the included studies, in particular a loss of 2 lines of Snellen visual acuity. We therefore considered it appropriate to include these two outcomes in our review given their use in the assessment of trabeculectomy outcomes.</P>
<P>No data were available on time to failure as no studies were found to use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis as an outcome measure. Additionally, only one study commented clearly on non-attendance rates. No data were available on quality-of-life measures. We therefore did not report outcomes for time to failure, quality of life and non-attendance rate.</P>
<P>Late hypotony, endophthalmitis and choroidal detachment are of clinical interest and significance when concerning trabeculectomy. We therefore chose these adverse outcomes as priority in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
