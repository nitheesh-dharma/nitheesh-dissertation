<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems in people with stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People often struggle with memory problems following stroke and this can lead to difficulties in everyday life. The degree and kind of memory problems, mood changes, and performance of everyday activities can vary widely depending on many factors, including the location of the stroke in the brain, severity, age, and the previous health of the person experiencing a stroke.</P>
<P>Memory rehabilitation, a part of cognitive rehabilitation, is a therapeutic activity that may play a role in the recovery of memory functions, or in enabling the individual to adapt to the problems. Memory rehabilitation is a standard part of rehabilitation in many settings. However, it is uncertain whether memory rehabilitation can improve people's memory problems, or whether it has an effect on mood, performance in everyday activities, or quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to May 2016. In this review, we included 13 studies with 514 participants. Seven trials were conducted with community participants, four with in-patients, and two with mixed community and in-patient samples. Participants received various types of memory retraining techniques, including training using computer programs and training in the use of memory aids, such as diaries or calendars. In three studies treatment was provided in groups and in 10 studies treatment was provided individually. Treatment lasted between two weeks and 10 weeks. In these studies, those who received the treatment were compared with a control group. The control group included those who did not receive cognitive rehabilitation or received another form of treatment. The control groups varied. Some studies had a control group wherein people received their usual care, whereas in others individuals in the control groups were placed on a waiting list to receive cognitive rehabilitation.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that people who received cognitive rehabilitation reported fewer memory problems in daily life immediately after treatment compared with the control groups. This represents a small to moderate effect of the intervention in comparison to the control group. However, there was no evidence that the benefits persisted in the long term. We found no evidence that cognitive rehabilitation improved people's independence in activities of daily living, mood, or quality of life. There was no information about any harm caused to participants from taking part in cognitive rehabilitation.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from very low (effect on outcomes that relate to everyday activities) to moderate (effect on self-reported memory problems, memory tests, and mood measures). There were a number of flaws in these studies, such as having very few people in them, and these could have affected our findings.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:20:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Memory problems are a common cognitive complaint following stroke and can potentially affect ability to complete functional activities. Cognitive rehabilitation programmes either attempt to retrain lost or poor memory functions, or teach patients strategies to cope with them.</P>
<P>Some studies have reported positive results of cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems, but the results obtained from previous systematic reviews have been less positive and they have reported inconclusive evidence. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and most recently updated in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:20:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine whether participants who have received cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems following a stroke have better outcomes than those given no treatment or a placebo control.</P>
<P>The outcomes of interest were subjective and objective assessments of memory function, functional ability, mood, and quality of life. We considered the immediate and long-term outcomes of memory rehabilitation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-23 17:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used a comprehensive electronic search strategy to identify controlled studies indexed in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 19 May 2016) and in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE (2005 to 7 March 2016), EMBASE 2005 to 7 March 2016), CINAHL (2005 to 5 February 2016), AMED (2005 to 7 March 2016), PsycINFO (2005 to 7 March 2016), and nine other databases and registries. Start dates for the electronic databases coincided with the last search for the previous review. We handsearched reference lists of primary studies meeting the inclusion criteria and review articles to identify further eligible studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:20:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials in which cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems was compared to a control condition. We included studies where more than 75% of the participants had experienced a stroke, or if separate data were available from those with stroke in mixed aetiology studies. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, which was then confirmed through group discussion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:20:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the investigators of primary studies for further information where required. We conducted data analysis and synthesis in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. We performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on the risk of bias of the primary studies included. Where there were sufficient numbers of similar outcomes, we calculated and reported standardised mean differences (SMD) using meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-26 16:18:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 trials involving 514 participants. There was a significant effect of treatment on subjective reports of memory in the short term (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.64, P = 0.01, moderate quality of evidence), but not the long term (SMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.64, P = 0.06, low quality of evidence). The SMD for the subjective reports of memory had small to moderate effect sizes.</P>
<P>The results do not show any significant effect of memory rehabilitation on performance in objective memory tests, mood, functional abilities, or quality of life.</P>
<P>No information was available on adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:21:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Participants who received cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems following a stroke reported benefits from the intervention on subjective measures of memory in the short term (i.e. the first assessment point after the intervention, which was a minimum of four weeks). This effect was not, however, observed in the longer term (i.e. the second assessment point after the intervention, which was a minimum of three months). There was, therefore, limited evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation. The evidence was limited due to the poor quality of reporting in many studies, lack of consistency in the choice of outcome measures, and small sample sizes. There is a need for more robust, well-designed, adequately powered, and better-reported trials of memory rehabilitation using common standardised outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-26 16:20:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-19 16:12:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Memory impairment occurs after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 2012</LINK>), and can persist over many years (<LINK REF="REF-Schaapsmeerders-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaapsmeerders 2013</LINK>). A systematic review of the prevalence of memory impairment after stroke estimated that between 23% and 55% have memory impairment three months after stroke and between 11% and 31% a year after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Snaphaan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snaphaan 2007</LINK>). A review of subjective cognitive complaints after stroke indicated that many stroke patients report problems with memory in daily life (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijsbergen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijsbergen 2014</LINK>), and complaints about memory problems are more frequent than complaints about impairment in other cognitive domains (<LINK REF="REF-Lamb-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamb 2013</LINK>). These cognitive impairments have been shown to have a negative effect on the patient's functional independence (<LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-16 13:33:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Cognitive rehabilitation is a "systematic, functionally oriented service of therapeutic activities that is based on assessment and understanding of the patient's brain-behavioural deficits" (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2005</LINK>). Memory rehabilitation is a component of this generic cognitive rehabilitation. Such rehabilitation facilitates the development of behavioural and cognitive strategies that have, as their goal, a positive impact on the structural and functional recovery of the damaged brain, and improve the quality of life of the individual in general (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally, memory rehabilitation has focused on teaching patients the use of internal aids (such as mnemonics, rehearsal, and mental imagery) and external memory aids (such as the use of diaries, notice boards, and lists) to help them remember and recall information. In addition, rehearsal is employed to attempt to restore memory function.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:21:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is uncertainty about the precise mechanisms of how memory rehabilitation interventions work. However, it is widely believed that interventions work by providing people with information about their memory problems, by teaching them the use of internal and external memory aids, by training people to use different strategies to pay attention, and alternative ways of encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Targeted, repeated stimulation of certain brain areas using 'drill and practice' cognitive exercises is thought to trigger the activation of neural networks. For group-based interventions, the therapeutic effects of being with others with similar problems may also help. Some of these behavioural strategies (referred to as 'restitution' or 'compensation') are believed to map onto the neural networks engaged in performing memory functions.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-26 16:20:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of memory rehabilitation after stroke has been examined by studies using different methodologies. Single-case and small group studies have reported positive results of memory rehabilitation, but the results obtained from some systematic reviews have been less positive and they have reported inconclusive evidence. <LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2011</LINK> suggested that teaching patients to use external memory aids (including assistive devices) with direct application to functional activities was recommended as a practice guideline in people with severe memory impairment after traumatic brain injury or stroke, but the evidence for other strategies for those with stroke is limited. <LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2015</LINK> highlighted the fact that there is very little strong evidence for the effectiveness of rehabilitation for cognitive deficits found after stroke, and concluded that very few direct clinical recommendations could be made. A similar conclusion was reached by <LINK REF="REF-Cumming-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumming 2013</LINK>.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:21:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For inclusion in the review, we sought randomised controlled trials, as defined by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and the pre-cross-over component of randomised cross-over trials with participants who have had a stroke, in which a memory treatment is compared with a control. Where publications were based on the same sample, or sub-set of a larger sample, we only included the study with the full sample to avoid double counting.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:21:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We confined trials included in this review to those with people who had memory deficits following stroke (based on a clinical definition as defined by the trialists). Thus, we excluded trials that included participants whose memory deficits were the result of traumatic brain injury, brain tumour, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or any other neurological condition unless at least 75% of the sample had a stroke, or a stroke subgroup could be identified for which there were separate data, or such data could be obtained from the study authors. Memory deficits were not defined in advance, but we assumed that those patients given treatment for impaired memory had memory deficits. We placed no restrictions on the types of memory deficits participants reported.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-16 13:41:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included trials in which there was a comparison between a treatment group that received one of various memory rehabilitation strategies, and a control group that received either an alternative form of treatment or no memory intervention.</P>
<P>We considered memory rehabilitation to be any attempt to modify memory function by means of 'drill and practice', or by the use of internal or external memory aids, or by teaching patients strategies to cope with their memory problems. We did not include drug studies.</P>
<P>We considered memory rehabilitation that took place over more than a single session. Therefore, we did not consider laboratory-based experiments (such as single session list-recall or mnemonic strategy training) to be cognitive rehabilitation.</P>

<P>Primary outcomes were measures of the extent of memory problems in everyday life. If there was more than one outcome measure measuring this construct in a study, we used the following hierarchy of commonly used tests that assess subjective reports of memory function: Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Sunderland-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderland 1983</LINK>), Subjective Memory Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1995</LINK>), Memory Assessment Clinics Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Crook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crook 1992</LINK>), Internal and External Memory Aids Questionnaires, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Broadbent-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadbent 1982</LINK>).</P>

<LI>The hierarchies of measures of memory function above were based on the tests' degree of sensitivity to assess everyday memory problems. For objective assessments, where the outcomes were not in the above hierarchy, general memory test scores were used over verbal memory, which were used over visual memory.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:21:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two authors (HC, EW) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials and completed 'Risk of bias' tables as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The table includes the following items:</P>

<LI>Random sequence generation.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment.</LI>
<LI>Blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting.</LI>

</UL>
<P>We judged these aspects on the basis of the information provided in the studies or, if this information was not available or was unclear from the reports(particularly relating to the randomisation procedure) we contacted the first author of the trial for further information. Two review authors completed ratings for each domain as being low or high risk of bias, or 'unclear' if sufficient information was not available, according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). A third review author (NBL) arbitrated any disagreements. None of the review authors were blinded to the names of the study authors, institutions, or the publishing journal of the included trials, as two of the review authors (RdN and NBL) work in this area and are familiar with the studies published in memory rehabilitation, and therefore could not be blinded.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:22:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We considered for inclusion parallel-group, cross-over, and cluster-RCTs, and included the data from all of these types of studies (where available) in the meta-analyses. For cross-over studies, we only included the pre-cross-over phase of the trials. We did not combine the first and second phases of the cross-over studies because of uncertainty about the carryover effects in such trials, given that they are psychological interventions, where the wash-out period is difficult to determine. For cluster-RCTs, our analyses followed the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> recommendation (16.3.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We included trials with more than two intervention or control groups and analysed them by pooling together the data from all of the experimental groups and comparing these with the control group. If there was more than one control group, we pooled the results from these.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:22:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity by comparing the distribution of important participant factors between trials (age, gender, type of stroke), and trial factors (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, losses to follow-up). We used the I statistic to statistically assess heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We consulted the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> to plan the data synthesis and we followed the procedures outlined therein (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). As most psychological and neuropsychological outcome measures in memory rehabilitation tend to be ordinal level measures, we treated these as continuous data (as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the SMD as a summary statistic as we predicted that multiple trials would employ various outcome measures to assess memory. If low scores represented a better outcome, we changed the valence of the score from positive (+) to negative (-). In situations where studies combined scores from scales in which high scores were in some instances good and in some instances poor outcomes, we reversed the signs of the discrepant scores to keep them consistent. For the meta-analysis we only considered data that we deemed to be similar or comparable enough to meaningfully pool on the basis of the outcome measures employed. Depending on the heterogeneity of the data, we considered fixed-effect or random-effects models.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We summarised an evaluation of the overall risk of bias, based on the relative importance of the various domains listed. In addition to the 'Risk of bias' table, we used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro</LINK>). We completed this process across outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This approach allowed for judgements to be made about the quality of the studies included in each outcome, so that any conclusions could be drawn from the outcome and the quality of studies included in that outcome. Where studies had two or more categories graded as high risk of bias we downgraded the quality by one grade.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes assessed</HEADING>
<P>A range of outcome measures were used by the included studies. Subjective measures of memory were used in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Doornhein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Doornhein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kaschel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lannin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lannin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radford-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Radford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westerberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westerberg 2007</LINK>). Each study used a different questionnaire measure. Objective memory abilities were assessed in 11 studies. <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK> used the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) as a measure of cognitive abilities but this does not include an assessment of memory. <LINK REF="STD-Lemoncello-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lemoncello 2011</LINK> did not use any objective measures. Of the 11 studies, six studies used a battery of memory tests, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT; <LINK REF="STD-_x00c5_kerlund-2013" TYPE="STUDY">흆erlund 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kaschel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lannin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lannin 2014</LINK>), the Wechsler Memory Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2014</LINK>), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (<LINK REF="STD-Prokopenko-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prokopenko 2013</LINK>). Five studies used measures of verbal learning, such as the RBMT Story Recall (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>), Rey AVLT (RAVLT) (<LINK REF="STD-Radford-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Radford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchella-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchella 2014</LINK>), 15 word test (<LINK REF="STD-Doornhein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Doornhein 1998</LINK>), and the Word list recall (<LINK REF="STD-Westerberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westerberg 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies examined whether their rehabilitation programme had an effect on functional abilities and all used different measures (<LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prokopenko-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prokopenko 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchella-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchella 2014</LINK>).

<P>For the meta-synthesis, we only included data from 11 of the 13 included studies, based on the data that were available. We summarised the outcomes under the domains of subjective memory, objective memory, functional abilities, mood, and quality of life. When pooling the data, we used a random-effects model because these were studies performed on a heterogeneous group of participants, with the intervention (being a complex intervention) being slightly different between studies (e.g. number of sessions). This would allow us to generalise our findings to most memory rehabilitation interventions offered for people who have had a stroke.</P>

<P>Ten studies included data on objective measures of memory immediately after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00c5_kerlund-2013" TYPE="STUDY">흆erlund 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doornhein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Doornhein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kaschel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lannin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lannin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radford-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Radford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westerberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westerberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchella-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchella 2014</LINK>), and four of these studies examined long-term effects of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00c5_kerlund-2013" TYPE="STUDY">흆erlund 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaschel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kaschel 2002</LINK>). Several objective memory measures were used, including comprehensive batteries (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Wechsler Memory Scale) and verbal memory sub-tests (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test story recall, 15 words test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed, Claeson-Dahl delayed). There were no significant differences found between intervention and control groups on either immediate or long-term follow-up on either memory test batteries (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.86, P = 0.43 and SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.41, P = 0.57, respectively; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 42% for objective memory assessed by a comprehensive battery immediately after intervention. On the verbal learning task, there was no significant difference between groups immediately after treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.46, P = 0.08). Data from only one study were available in relation to long-term verbal learning outcome and this was therefore not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome 3: Functional abilities (activities of daily living: ADL)</HEADING>
<P>Three studies included measures of participants' function in terms of ADL immediately after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchella-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchella 2014</LINK>), and one study in the long term (<LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>). The Functional Independence Measure, Extended Activities of Daily Living scale and an unspecified independence measure were used as the outcome measures of ADL. There was no significant effect of treatment on functional ability immediately after treatment (SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.35 to 2.68, P = 0.13; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic suggested significant statistical heterogeneity at 93%. Data from only one study were available in relation to long-term functional outcome and this was therefore not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome 4: Mood</HEADING>
<P>Three studies included measures of participants' mood immediately after treatment and at long-term follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00c5_kerlund-2013" TYPE="STUDY">흆erlund 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-das-Nair-2012" TYPE="STUDY">das Nair 2012</LINK>). Mood was measured on the General Health Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression sub-scale) and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. No effect of treatment was found on mood either immediately (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.21, P = 0.63; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), or on long-term follow-up (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.19, P = 0.35; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There was no statistical heterogeneity at immediate or long-term follow-up (Tau = 0.00; Chi = 0.66, df = 2 (P = 0.72); I = 0% and Tau = 0.02; Chi = 2.40, df = 2 (P = 0.30); I = 17%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome 5: Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Only one study included measures of participants' quality of life (assessed on the EQ-5D) immediately after treatment and at long-term follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>). Therefore, we did not enter this into the meta-analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean quality of life measures (immediate outcome) between the intervention and control groups on the Utility score (intervention: m = 0.76; standard deviation (SD) 0.26; control: m = 0.76; SD 0.25; P = 1.00; d = 0), or the visual analogue scale (VAS) score (intervention: m = 67.89; SD 16.61; control: m = 70.23; SD 15.67; P = 0.39; d = 0.15); or in the long term on the Utility score (intervention: m = 0.76; SD 0.26; control: m = 0.78; SD 0.22; P = 0.63; d = 0.08), or the VAS score (intervention: m = 68.38; SD 17.94; control: m = 71.51; SD 13.61; P = 0.25; d = 0.19).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:23:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Overall, the results suggested a beneficial effect of memory rehabilitation on subjective reports of memory problems in daily life immediately after treatment. However, no statistically significant effects of treatment were observed on these outcomes at longer-term follow-up. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups on objective memory abilities immediately after intervention or long-term as assessed by comprehensive memory batteries, or immediately as assessed on verbal learning tasks. No statistically significant differences were observed on measures of mood or functional abilities, either immediately after the intervention or on long-term follow-up. We could not assess the impact of memory rehabilitation on quality of life as only one study had assessed this outcome.</P>
<P>Therefore, it appears that memory rehabilitation has a positive effect on subjective reports of memory problems in people who have had a stroke. This, however, was not substantiated by the findings from the objective tests of memory (either as a comprehensive test battery or as a verbal learning task). This discrepancy might suggest that people 'feel' that they have improved, with no actual change to their memory function, because they have learnt to cope with their memory problems. Often, subjective reports of memory are associated with mood (<LINK REF="REF-Lamb-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamb 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijsbergen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijsbergen 2014</LINK>), but this was not evident from our review. Another interpretation is that the subjective and objective measures of memory assess two different aspects of memory. The significant effect of memory rehabilitation on subjective memory measures was strongly influenced by results from one study that had a large sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Aben-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Aben 2014</LINK>). These results will remain tentative until there are more large studies.</P>
<P>There was a lack of consistency in the outcome domains assessed. While many studies included measures of subjective memory problems, mood, and functional abilities, they rarely used the same measure. Several objective memory measures were used, and often the primary outcome was not clearly specified by the trialists.</P>
<P>Indeed, many studies suffered from poor quality of reporting, particularly failing to state the procedures for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, and reasons for loss to follow-up. Most trialists did not comply with the CONSORT guidelines in reporting their trial (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). The obvious result of such failings was the lack of clarity in discerning the methods of the study. Another major concern was the degree of clinical and methodological heterogeneity that trials in memory rehabilitation possess. Without trials explicitly elucidating methodological procedures, heterogeneity cannot be adequately addressed. Furthermore, although statistical heterogeneity was not evident in most of the analyses, on two outcomes it was in the low to moderate range, and on one outcome it was high. We were unable to conduct a thorough inspection of the cause of this heterogeneity because of the small sample size and small number of studies. However, we suspect that it may have been caused because many trials used multiple tests of objective memory function (with comprehensive batteries having several different sub-tests, each measuring a different component of memory). In addition, in all trials both participants and therapists were aware of the group to which they were allocated. This is difficult to avoid in trials of cognitive rehabilitation, but may lead to some bias.</P>
<P>The results of this review suggest that there is some evidence to support the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation for subjective memory impairments immediately after treatment, but these benefits are not maintained at long-term follow-up. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for memory ability, mood, independence in activities of daily living, or quality of life.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:23:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There are limitations to this review. Many of the studies identified included samples with mixed diagnoses, and although several study authors provided separate data for those with stroke, the sample sizes were small. A sensitivity analysis could have been conducted to compare the stroke-only studies with those with stroke patients as part of a mixed diagnosis group, but given that most trials had small samples further fractionating may have led to further reduction in power, which we felt would lead to inconclusive findings. Mixed diagnoses studies are beneficial in determining the potential for the generalisability of training programmes across diagnostic groups and reflect usual clinical practice in many centres, but there are likely to be differential effects of the training based on diagnosis and even severity (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2000</LINK>). This is an area that requires further investigation.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:23:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>These findings are limited due to the small number of studies included for each outcome and the small sample sizes. The evidence was limited due to poor quality of reporting in many studies and lack of consistency in the choice of outcome measures. Furthermore, as seen from the GRADE quality ratings, we rated most studies as being of moderate quality. Downgrading was typically due to serious study limitations, where we had assessed studies as having two or more areas with a high risk of bias. Other reasons for downgrading were wide confidence intervals, small sample sizes, mixed diagnosis groups, and inconsistency (large I<SUP>2 </SUP>values).</P>

However, unlike the previous Cochrane review, this review found evidence to suggest that there was a beneficial effect of cognitive rehabilitation for memory on subjective measures of memory in the short term.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-31 09:57:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Given that a large number of individuals complain of memory problems following a stroke, and considering that some centres are offering a variety of interventions to address these problems, questioning the effectiveness of these treatment programmes is pertinent. The studies examined in this review reflected the diversity of intervention strategies employed in memory rehabilitation, and variation in outcome measures used to evaluate their effectiveness. In this review, we found some evidence to suggest that memory rehabilitation was more effective than no rehabilitation or control. However, our results indicate that any benefits of memory rehabilitation were limited to improvements in subjective reports of memory function in the short term and they are inconclusive for long-term follow-up. <BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:24:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The evidence base for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems following stroke, from the literature surveyed, appears weak. Few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, and many had methodological flaws inherent in the study design. There was an increased risk of random errors due to sampling errors and small sample sizes, an over-reliance and misinterpretation of significance tests (without mention of confidence intervals), problems related to poor (or absent) reporting of randomisation procedures, poor (or absent) blinding, differences in the nature of the outcomes measured, and overall poor quality of reporting of trials. The results of this review suggest that there is an urgent need for further well-conceptualised, executed, and reported RCTs of memory rehabilitation for people who have had a stroke, which take into consideration some of the issues raised in this review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-08-22 13:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In the previous review, we considered functional measures (including quality of life) as the primary outcome of interest for memory rehabilitation. However, we believe that while this is still a goal of memory rehabilitation, quality of life is perhaps too distal an outcome, which can be influenced by a variety of factors that may not be related to the intervention. We therefore felt that a subjective rating of problems related to memory in daily life was a more realistic yet meaningful outcome for participants who have had memory rehabilitation. Thus, for this update, we have considered the extent of memory problems in everyday life as the primary outcome. Compared to the previous version, we have expanded the description of outcome measures with greater detail and have updated the methods to include the use of the 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE methods.</P>

<P>I: participants received an "off the shelf" PDA device with features of an alarm, calendar, address book, and camera. Participants prioritised meaningful activities they wanted to increase their independence in or memory of. They received support/training in its use, which consisted of 5 training modules covering selection of an appropriate device, awareness of deficit(s), application skills, and organisational strategies.
