<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:25:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Some evidence is available to suggest that multi-component community interventions are effective in influencing smoking behaviour and preventing the uptake of smoking in young people. These interventions use co-ordinated, widespread, multi-component programmes to try and influence young people's behaviour. Community members are often involved in determining and/or implementing these programmes. These include education of tobacco retailers about age restrictions, programmes for prevention of smoking-related diseases, mass media, school and family-based programmes. Changes in intentions to smoke, knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about smoking did not generally appear to affect the long-term success of the programmes.</P>

<P>Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the world. Decisions to smoke are often made within a broad social context and therefore community interventions using coordinated, multi-component programmes may be effective in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-02-09 11:22:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of multi-component community based interventions in influencing smoking behaviour, which includes preventing the uptake of smoking in young people.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-01-31 02:56:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>The Tobacco Addiction group's specialised register, Medline and other health, psychology and public policy electronic databases were searched, the bibliographies of identified studies were checked and raw data was requested from study authors. Searches were updated in August 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:25:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Randomized and non randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of multi-component community interventions compared to no intervention or to single component or school-based programmes only. Reported outcomes had to include smoking behaviour in young people under the age of 25 years.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-06-09 12:19:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Information relating to the characteristics and the content of community interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the study was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Studies were combined in a meta-analysis where possible and reported in narrative synthesis in text and table.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-09 13:05:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Twenty-five studies were included in the review and sixty-eight studies did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. All studies used a controlled trial design, with fifteen using random allocation of schools or communities. One study reported a reduction in short-term smoking prevalence (twelve months or less), while nine studies detected significant long-term effects. Two studies reported significantly lower smoking rates in the control population while the remaining thirteen studies showed no significant difference between groups. Improvements were seen in secondary outcomes for intentions to smoke in six out of eight studies, attitudes in five out of nine studies, perceptions in two out of six studies and knowledge in three out of six studies, while significant differences in favour of the control were seen in one of the nine studies assessing attitudes and one of six studies assessing perceptions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-09 13:07:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of community interventions in reducing the uptake of smoking in young people, but the evidence is not strong and contains a number of methodological flaws.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-15 15:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-13 11:56:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The reduction of smoking prevalence among adolescents remains a key public health priority (<LINK REF="REF-BMA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMA 2008</LINK>). Addiction to nicotine usually begins during adolescence although the proportion of new smokers who first use cigarettes after the age of 18 has increased in the United States from around 25% in 2002 to 40% in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2009</LINK>). An estimated one-in-five young teenagers already smokes regularly and another 30 million children throughout the world will take up the habit every year (<LINK REF="REF-GYTSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GYTSC 2002</LINK>) with 19.1% of school students who had never smoked cigarettes indicating that they would initiate smoking within the next year (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2008</LINK>). In England the prevalence of regular smoking amongst 11 to 15 year olds in 2009 was 6%, a decline from 13% in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-IC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS IC 2010</LINK>). Amongst 15 year olds the prevalence was higher in girls (16%) than boys (14%) (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-IC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS IC 2010</LINK>). Current reports still indicate that globally, smoking behaviour among adolescent girls is increasing over that of boys (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-UMDNJ-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UMDNJ 2007</LINK> New Jersey Youth Tobacco Survey estimates that 90 million cigarettes, or 4.2 million packs of cigarettes were consumed by high-school students annually in 2006.</P>
<P>There is a wide-held theory that if smoking does not start during adolescence, it is unlikely ever to occur (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 1994</LINK>). This has resulted in various attempts to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking through primary prevention programmes, which have been designed to discourage experimentation with cigarettes and to deter regular use. Most interventions have included prevention programmes delivered in school settings, however the results have been mixed and reported effects small (<LINK REF="REF-Rooney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooney 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wiehe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiehe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2006</LINK>). Mass media interventions have been compared in another Cochrane review, <LINK REF="REF-Brinn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brinn 2010</LINK> also with mixed results. The most effective campaigns for the review (<LINK REF="REF-Brinn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brinn 2010</LINK>) were based on solid theoretical grounds, used formative research in designing the campaign message, and the message broadcasts were of reasonable intensity over extensive periods of time. Recognition that decisions to smoke are made within a broad social context has led to the development and implementation of community-wide programmes. Such interventions are based on the premise that social and environmental processes impact upon health and well-being and contribute to health decline, disease, and mortality. It has been argued that the essence of the community approach to influence smoking behaviour, in particular smoking prevention lies in its multi-dimensionality, in the co-ordination of activities to maximise the chance of reaching all members, and in ongoing and widespread support for the maintenance of non-smoking behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Schofield-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schofield 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions with multiple components such as age restrictions for tobacco purchase, tobacco-free public places, various mass media communications and special programmes in schools are often combined to create large-scale community-wide initiatives, to influence the smoking behaviour of young people. Initiatives vary in the extent to which they emphasise community involvement in problem specification and planning of the intervention. Some have been conducted through community groups and organisations emphasising a principle of 'ownership' or 'partnership' in promoting health. Community members are involved in decisions about the implementation of various activities within the programme, often building on existing organisational structures.</P>
<P>Despite the potential of community-wide programmes, debate continues about their effectiveness in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. For example, a non-systematic review of eighteen smoking prevention programmes up to 1995 concluded that community initiatives have yet to demonstrate that they can directly reduce smoking prevalence in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 1996</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-06-09 15:02:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>To carry out a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of community interventions in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. In particular the following issues were addressed:</P>
<P>
<BR/>a. The effectiveness of community interventions, compared with no intervention in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people;</P>
<P>b. The effectiveness of community interventions compared with other single component interventions (e.g. school-based programmes) in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people.</P>

<P>We considered studies using one of the following designs: </P>
<P>a. RCT: (randomized controlled trials) in which participants were assigned prospectively to one or more alternative forms of intervention using a process of random allocation;</P>
<P>b. CCT: (controlled clinical trials) in which participants were assigned prospectively at the level of community, geographical region or school, to one or more alternative intervention groups using a quasi-random allocation method, or in which the method of assignment was unclear but could possibly have been random or quasi-random;</P>
<P>c. CBA: (controlled before-and-after trial) where contemporaneous baseline and post-intervention data was collected from the intervention group and a comparable population, (no CBA studies were identified for inclusion in this review).</P>
<P>Each study needed to have a minimum of two clusters in each of the intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Studies which did not report baseline characteristics were excluded.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-09 15:05:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Interventions were considered which:</P>
<P>a. were targeted at entire or parts of entire communities or large areas, and;</P>
<P>b. had the intention of influencing the smoking behaviour of young people, and;</P>
<P>c. focused on multi-component (i.e. more than one) community intervention, which could include but was not limited to: school-based programmes, media promotion (e.g. TV, radio, print), public policy, organisational initiatives, health care provider initiatives, sports, retailer and workplace initiatives, anti-tobacco contests and youth anti-smoking clubs.</P>
<P>Community interventions were defined as coordinated widespread (multi-component) programmes in a particular geographical area (e.g. school districts) or region or in groupings of people who share common interests or needs, which support non-smoking behaviour.</P>
<P>Studies which only included single component interventions, did not have community involvement (e.g. school-based only) or had mass media as the sole form of intervention delivery were excluded.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-06-13 12:01:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Young people were classified as smokers or non-smokers in different ways according to daily, weekly or monthly frequency of smoking, or by lifetime consumption. Where possible the strictest distinction was used, in which youths with any history of cigarette use were defined as smokers.</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 15:14:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The primary outcome measure of smoking behaviour were objective (e.g. saliva thiocyanate levels, alveolar carbon monoxide) or self-reported smoking. This outcome was measured in terms of:</P>
<P>a) the level of change in smoking behaviour observed,</P>
<P>b) the sustainability of the change in behaviour after the intervention ('less than' versus 'longer than' one year).</P>

<P>The quality of included studies were assessed using the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and additional criteria developed by the Cochrane EPOC Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2009</LINK>). One review author (KC) independently assessed the risk of bias for each included study, which was independently assessed again by one of two additional authors (MB or NL). All disagreements were resolved by consensus. Risk of bias was assessed with the following seven domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential threats to validity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Three additional domains were included that assessed design-specific threats to validity including: imbalance of outcome measures at baseline; comparability of intervention and control group characteristics at baseline; and protection against contamination (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2009</LINK>). Finally, for cluster study designs, we assessed the risk of bias associated with an additional domain; selective recruitment of participants. In studies eligible for inclusion in this review, the term &#8216;participant&#8217; may refer to schools, community organisations and individual young people.</P>

<P>Studies found to contain unit of analysis errors were re-analysed if data were available. Unit of analysis errors are found in studies that allocate participants to treatment or control in clusters (e.g. schools and communities), but analyse the results by individual participants. This can result in overestimation of the statistical significance of the results by not accounting for the clustering of individuals in the data (<LINK REF="REF-Rooney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooney 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). For studies that did not include adjustments for clustering the size of the trial was reduced to the effective sample size (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1992</LINK>) using the original sample size from each study, divided by a design effect of 1.2 which is consistent with other smoking cessation community intervention trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1992</LINK>) and as per recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook, section 16.3.4 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Meta-analyses were only conducted if relevant, valid data were available from at least two studies of the same design, with interventions that were conceptually similar (e.g. interventions that include school components) and measured the same outcome.

<P>The effects of community interventions are complex, and may be influenced by a number of competing factors.

We were unable to use a Forrest plot for visual inspection of the data due to an insufficient number of included studies for the reported outcomes. We conducted sub-group analyses to further investigate the different aspects of community intervention programmes. Subgroup analyses were conducted only if comparable data (as outlined above) was available from two studies, which could be considered similar enough to be included in the same subgroup, (e.g. two studies conducted in rural areas), or reporting separate outcomes for different subgroups (e.g. by gender).

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2011-06-15 14:57:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>All 25 studies investigated the effects of multi-component community interventions directed at young people, <U>&lt;</U>25 years, using either a parallel group RCT (n=15) or CCT (n=10) design. Trials were published between 1989 and 2009, though the methodology and preliminary results for some studies were published earlier; from 1983. A total of approximately 104,000 participants were recruited from a mixture of schools (n=735), community clubs (n=92), communities/cities/towns n=49 and paediatric practices (n=12). Seventeen studies originated from the United States of America, three from Australia, two from the United Kingdom and one each from India and Finland. One study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>) included six countries (Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) as a nested, cluster controlled clinical trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of communities:</HEADING>
<P>The communities in which the interventions took place varied across the studies. For example, in one study the populations of the communities randomised ranged from 1,700 to 13,500 (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>) and another was based in a city of 1.3 million people (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>), while the largest study spanned six countries (<LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>). Some communities were in rural areas (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>) whilst others were in towns or cities in predominantly urban areas (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>) and some communities were specifically targeted because of economic deprivation (<LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of participants:</HEADING>
<P>The participants varied across studies. Some studies targeted young people in specific high-risk groups; for example those defined as high-risk because they lived in a deprived area (<LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>), because they attended a continuation high-school (continuation high-schools are alternative high-schools in the USA for young people at risk of dropping out of the school) (<LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>), or because they were expected to have a high smoking prevalence (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>). Native American children living on reservations were targeted in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>). The age of participants ranged from 8 to 24 years across the different studies. The age of targeted participants also varied and ranged from 10 to 24 years of age.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of interventions:</HEADING>
<P>The interventions evaluated in the 25 studies were diverse and each differed in the focus of activity. Thirteen focused specifically on influencing youth smoking behaviour through tobacco prevention initiatives (<LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>), five included tobacco prevention with an additional aim to reduce specific health risk factors for cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>) or cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>), while the remaining seven studies combined goals through a combination of tobacco prevention with either reduction or cessation initiatives (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>). Though the interventions for all studies involved influencing smoking behaviour, nine studies also included interventions for alcohol, (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) alcohol and marijuana (<LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>) or alcohol, marijuana, other drug use and/or delinquent behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The extent to which attempts were made to include community participation also varied significantly. In five studies community leaders were encouraged to become actively involved in both the development and in giving ongoing support for the community programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>), though the duration and intensity of involvement differed. In the 'Age Appropriate' arm of the <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK> study a community organiser was employed for six months over a three year period whilst in the 'Intensive' arm the organiser was employed for one fifteen month block. They were trained to use survey data, prioritise and target risk factors for prevention actions and to choose which prevention policies and programmes addressed the communities needs. However, in the <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK> study, eight community organisers were hired to create and facilitate extra-curricular activities for the second component of the D.A.R.E. intervention. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>, community leaders received six training sessions delivered over six to twelve months to form a community coalition of diverse stakeholders to implement and monitor the intervention. Other studies involved multiple organisations including the national health service, city councils, social workers, business owners, voluntary organisations, sports organisations, health care providers, community organisations, media, retailers, schools, government, law enforcement or workplaces.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Specific intervention components:</HEADING>
<P>The majority of studies included school components in addition to a multi-component community intervention (twenty one of the twenty five included studies), though the duration and intensity differed. As examples, <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK> had five class sessions over a one week period for three consecutive years, and <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK> allowed schools to choose any combination of school and community programmes which ranged from five, two-hour weekly sessions to weekly, year-long classroom activities; <LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK> included ten school and homework sessions per year over two years, while <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK> only included an optional activity to conduct a tobacco survey at school as part of an intervention run through local community 4-Health Clubs. This intervention included education, booklets, worksheets, puzzles, stories, experiments, poster and activities to make a anti-smoking commercial at 4-Health Clubs. One other trial conducted an intervention with local girls' and boys' Clubs <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK> including education, group activities and video sessions, however no school-based interventions were included. In total four studies included no school related activities (<LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>). The remaining three studies involved: recruitment from a migrant education programme with an intervention focusing on parent/child communications with eight weeks of evening group meetings plus booster sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK> enrolled subjects from a paediatric primary care setting, where the family would decide upon a personal tobacco prevention policy with the addition of subsequent clinician education visits, twelve mail out newsletters specific to adults and twelve specific to young people in addition to letters from their respective clinician. Finally the <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK> intervention focused on the government initiated 'Clean Indoor Air' policy as their programme, with an evaluation of the subsequent smoking ban in public places, particularly in restaurants, cafes and bars.</P>
<P>Optional extracurricular projects were added to some interventions including organisation of a tobacco-free day and the option of working with community agencies on tobacco use prevention (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>), non-smoking conference attendance on National non-smoking day (<LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>), health fairs, after-school clubs and amusement park activities (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>), promotion of World No Tobacco Day (<LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>), drug-free parties and drug-awareness week (<LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>), amongst others (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>). Four studies used incentives for completion of tobacco prevention assignments and to improve class attendance (<LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sixteen trials involved parent/guardian participation which mainly included education through pamphlets or homework requiring parent/guardian involvement (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>).

Some included specific activities for youth to reduce illegal tobacco sales, (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>) whilst the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK> reminded tobacco retailers about the law before conducting retailer tests where young people attempted to purchase tobacco products. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>) provided retailer education and surveillance.</P>
<P>Health care professionals as intervention deliverers were a key component in four studies and a smaller component of interventions in four other studies. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>, used the paediatric primary care setting to recruit youth and implement the intervention via family/clinician meetings through individualised development of a smoke-free policy, for each family. Other studies included training for pharmacists and dental care interventions (<LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>), continuing education and utilisation of health professionals (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>), or simply provided health education through intervention components such as mass media and other health promotion activities (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>). Further encouragement into healthy life-style choices through smoke-free sporting events such as roller-skating, rock climbing, bowling, snowboarding, skiing, disc golf tourneys and skateboarding competitions, were also aspects to the <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK> studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Specific control components:</HEADING>
<P>Most studies used usual activities as the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>), though two studies included minimal interventions which included components to influence youth smoking behaviour - <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK> opted to invest the same intensity and duration for the programme, where the intervention focused on drug use prevention, and <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK> provided control students with smoking prevention booklets which were used in schools, plus take home workbooks. Retailers were also tested for underage cigarette purchases in the control catchment areas through students attempting purchases. Three control areas were provided with delayed interventions, which were commenced after the evaluation period for the studies were completed (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>) offered the intervention to control schools after completion of the evaluation only if the schools requested it, however support was offered for other health related issues during the evaluation period. Other initiatives unrelated to smoking were used as controls in some studies to account for biases associated with increased resources and attention provided to intervention subjects, or as an alternative means of providing some form of benefit to the control clusters for their participation in the evaluation. The control group in <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK> consisted of a first aid and home safety education programme focused on preparation for emergencies, skills and household safety concerns such as baby-proofing a house. Education, role-playing sessions and intensity of the programme mimicked that of the smoking prevention intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK> school students learned about drug and alcohol abuse prevention through a modified version of Project Toward No Drug abuse, (<LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>) focusing on health motivation, social skills and decision making regarding drug and alcohol use.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention delivery:</HEADING>
<P>Methods for the programme message implementation varied significantly between studies with the majority of interventions delivered by multiple individuals. Teachers and other school faculty contributed to intervention delivery in sixteen studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>) and were trained by study investigators or paid research staff. The level of training varied between studies and within study clusters, for example in <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>, the largest study including six countries, training for teachers varied from two to forty-eight hours. Adult and youth volunteers contributed as trained volunteer leaders (<LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>), volunteers for Big Brother and Big Sister tutoring programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>), peer narrators for prevention information (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>) or other roles (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>). Peers were also elected by teachers or fellow class mates and were trained to act as role models and deliver influential programme messages for seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome collection:</HEADING>
<P>Smoking behaviour was assessed in all studies by self-report, though two studies used face-to-face interviews for data collection purposes. A number of different intermediate outcomes were measured, including knowledge about the effects of smoking, attitudes toward smoking and intentions to smoke in the future. Chemical validation occurred in eight studies by exhaled carbon monoxide (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>) in addition to plasma thiocyanate levels for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>). A random number of students in half of the school classes in the <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK> study were assessed for saliva thiocyanate levels, whilst in the <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK> trial only a small proportion were analysed. Researchers in the <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK> study collected exhaled carbon monoxide samples for bogus pipeline measures only.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation:</HEADING>
<P>Methods for choosing intervention and control areas varied across studies and in some cases the details provided were unclear. Some studies chose areas specifically to target particular groups of young people such as those with a high risk of substance abuse (<LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>). In some studies the allocation of areas, communities or schools within particular geographical regions to either intervention or control was random (<LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>), whilst for other studies allocation was random after communities or areas had been matched on a number of different factors. The investigators described a random component for sequence generation in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>) which includes coin tossing or the use of computer generated random number tables.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment:</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was inadequate in twelve studies, i.e. the assignment of participants was not conclealed from investigators (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>), and unclear in the remaining thirteen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding for participants and outcome assessors:</HEADING>
<P>All studies were inadequate in terms of blinding for participants due to the nature of a community-delivered intervention. No authors mentioned any attempts to conceal subject allocation from outcome assessors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data:</HEADING>
<P>Complete reporting of outcome data occurred in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>), which accounted for attrition in the sample population and described methods of handling missing variables in data sets, such as via random imputation or removal of data sets missing 90% of the responses etc. Five other studies failed to address incomplete outcome data. <LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK> had significant amounts of data missing from one of the intervention schools and three classes in the control school; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK> failed to mention characteristics of participants unable to be followed up and mentioned the collection of weekly and ever smoking data outcomes, however the data was not presented as it was deemed 'very similar' to the results for monthly smoking. The <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK> study was unable to collect data at some time points due to gaps in funding, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK> study were unable to schedule in-school surveys for two intensive and one control school despite attempts. Both the <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK> studies mentioned outcome variables as being collected, which were not reported in the publications. The remaining fourteen studies had unclear reporting of incomplete outcome data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting:</HEADING>
<P>Selective reporting was unclear in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sussman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sussman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schinke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schinke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>) and was a high risk of bias for the remaining fifteen. Examples of selective reporting include outcomes reported incompletely with missing n-values for separate intervention and control groups or as a visual representation only which can not be meta-analysed or studies failing to include results for a key outcome which would be expected to be reported for such a study.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Imbalance of outcome measures at baseline:</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>) failed to address imbalances in outcome measures at baseline, five studies were unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>), whilst the remaining seventeen studies accounted for any imbalances in outcome measures at baseline through statistical measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparability of intervention and control characteristics at baseline:</HEADING>
<P>Only one study failed to address comparability of intervention and control group characteristics at baseline. In <LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK> the authors mentioned a possibility of non-equivalence of study groups, since the majority of schools were assigned to programme and control conditions based on administrator flexibility.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Protection against contamination:</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies had potential sources of contamination: A state-wide tobacco education programme was initiated in 1990, which may have affected the control group results in the <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK> study. The control group in the Netherlands for the <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> study also underwent a national smoking prevention programme simultaneously with the evaluation for this programme. The <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK> study had schools containing both intervention and control groups within them, whilst authors in the <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK> study mentioned contamination as a difficulty in their discussion. <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK> provided the intervention to boys and girls clubs, a setting in which authors believe a natural 'booster programme' effect may have occurred for both prevention groups, thus making the two treatment groups similar. In addition, 87% of the 'SMART only' and 87% of the 'controls' reported learning about alcohol and other drugs from an intervention programme at school. For the <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK> study, authors mention a possibility that little difference existed between the extent of exposure for intervention and control conditions. Furthermore, a comprehensive programme aimed at reducing the sale of cigarettes to minors was implemented in the control in Northern Sydney during the closing stages of the evaluation. Finally the <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK> study had possible contamination due to one control city banning public smoking in 1990 which subsequently produced a large decline in smoking. One-third of survey respondents for this study did not live in the treatment cities during the entire intervention period. Although authors adjusted for this in their analysis the results did not change. Six studies were adequately protected against contamination (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>), whilst the remaining 12 studies had unclear protection against contamination.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall summary of smoking behaviour:</HEADING>
<P>Overall ten interventions presented in the 25 studies demonstrated intervention effectiveness in influencing smoking behaviour including prevention, at primary follow up. One programme provided statistically and clinically significant short-term benefits (&lt;12 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>) and nine provided longer-lasting effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK> (only in <I>post hoc</I> testing); <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK> (up until eight-year follow up); <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK> (for 12- and 48-month follow ups only); <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> (at 30 months only); <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK> (for boys only in the D.A.R.E. Plus intervention; and when combining both D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E.

Two interventions favoured the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>), whilst the remaining 13 studies demonstrated no significant benefit.</P>
<P>Narrative synthesis has been used to report primary outcomes, secondary outcomes and process measures for all studies (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). A combination of 16 studies were able to be included in the meta-analyses, with eight studies being the largest number of studies available for one outcome. However these results should be interpreted with caution as outcomes are only reported for studies in which data were available for meta-analyses. Of the studies categorised as showing evidence of clinically and statistically significant benefit, only two (<LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>) reported outcomes that could be included in the meta-analysis. Smoking was assessed as daily (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), weekly (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), monthly (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), ever smoked (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) and smokeless tobacco use (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Sub-group analyses were conducted based on intervention duration <U>&lt;</U> 12 months and &gt; 13 months. There were no statistically or clinically significant results for weekly, monthly or smokeless tobacco use. For daily smoking and 'ever smoked' the point estimates were consistent with a clinical benefit but the number of studies were small and the confidence intervals wide (daily smoking <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, two studies, OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.15)), (ever smoked <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, three studies, OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.74)).</P>
<P>An alternative subgroup analysis (Analysis 2) using length of follow up rather than duration of intervention, did not provide any evidence that this affected outcomes or explained heterogeneity. Studies could contribute to both short and long follow up groups, but there was not enough data to detect whether intervention effect might increase or decline over time.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK> study reported reductions in the intervention community versus the control community, who received the media component only, whilst in <I>post hoc</I> analyses of the <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK> study, both intervention groups reported significant reductions in cigarette use over that of the control group (p&lt;0.05). Both <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK> programmes were initially designed as large-scale, cardiovascular disease prevention programmes aimed at entire populations, and included a school-based component specifically targeting young people. Although smoking outcomes in the <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK> study were not significant at 15-year follow up, significant effects in favour of the intervention were seen for daily and weekly smoking up until 8-year follow up (p=0.035 and p=0.022 respectively), and for monthly smoking up until 4-year follow up (p=0.004). The <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK> study reported reductions in the community intervention group compared with a school based programme only. <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK> compared two interventions to a control population with a statistically significant difference observed amongst boys in the 'D.A.R.E. Plus' intervention and a clinically significant difference for the combined gender population for the same intervention. For the <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> study the results were diverse due to the large scale of the project (interventions delivered across six countries). Reductions in smoking onset were observed in two of the six countries as well as increased smoking observed in two of the six countries, being Denmark and the UK showing counterproductive trends at 12 months. At 24 months no overall significant effects were seen despite two countries significantly favouring the intervention. Whilst at 30 months an overall significant effect in favour of the interventions was seen (p=0.03) with two countries showing statistically and clinically significant benefits. <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> was unable to be included in the meta-analysis as authors excluded current smokers at baseline from all analyses, only following up those initiating smoking after baseline samples were collected. As such this study could not be compared to the other community trials included in this review which assessed the programme's influence on smoking behaviour in addition to prevention, rather than prevention alone. Due to the large scale of the evaluation, a separate table summarising each of the outcomes at each follow up period has been included (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK> by two-year follow up, overall tobacco use increased by 68% in the control group whilst a decrease of 17% was found in the intervention group. Significant between group differences in favour of the intervention were found for trajectories of cigarette smoking (p&lt;0.05), bidi smoking (p&lt;0.01) and any tobacco use (p&lt;0.04) (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>). In both <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>, community programme efforts were combined with a school based component to decrease smoking prevalence in the intervention group, whilst an increase was observed in the control population. In addition the <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK> study demonstrated a significant reduction in smokeless tobacco use for the intervention population compared to the control.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK> showed no significant effects overall for smoking prevention, the time x treatment analysis of the 'susceptible cohort' showed a significant result in favour of the intervention at 12- and 24 months post study commencement. Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK> study produced no significant effects for the population as a whole or for 'cohort 1' separately, however 'cohort 2' showed a significant effect in favour of the intervention at 12-months follow up. Authors report data for the four group comparison study in the <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK> papers as showing no significant effects. However for the purposes of this analysis the three intervention groups have been combined and compared to the control group, which subsequently produced a marginally significant finding in favour of the control (p=0.05), although the confidence intervals do touch the line of no effect (95% CI 1.00 to 1.51, odds ratio 1.23).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall summary of secondary outcomes:</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcomes including behaviours, (intentions to smoke, rules on smoking) attitudes, (advantages, disadvantages, peer attitudes, overall attitudes, okay for young people to smoke) perceptions (peer smoking, norms) and knowledge (total, first use harmful/mild okay) had mixed results. For a summary of the intervention effectiveness at each reported study follow-up period see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. At final follow up a total of eight studies assessed smoking behaviours of which five favoured the intervention: <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; for combined D.A.R.E and D.A.R.E Plus groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>); for time x treatment analysis only (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>); one study favoured the intervention for two out of six countries (<LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>), and two had no significant benefit (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>). Nine studies assessed attitudes, out of which five favoured the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK> (for time x treatment analysis only on tobacco-anticipated outcomes); <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> (for 2/6 countries only); <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>), three showed no statistical difference between groups, whilst adjusted data in the <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK> study for the outcome 'okay for young people to smoke' favoured the control, despite the overall meta-analysis for this outcome favouring the intervention (p=0.02). Perceptions were assessed in six studies of which two favoured the intervention, (<LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK> (for Intensive HFL only, the Age appropriate HFL produced no significant benefit)), one favoured the control (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>) and three produced no significant differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>). Finally, knowledge scores favoured the intervention in three (<LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>) of the six studies which assessed this outcome, whilst the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>) showed no significant effect.</P>
<P>A combination of five studies were able to be included in the meta-analyses, with three studies being the largest number available to assess one outcome. Behaviours were assessed as rules on smoking at home (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) which showed a statistically and clinically significant effect favouring the intervention (OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.18), p=0.009), and intentions to smoke (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>), which also had a statistically non-significant but clinically significant effect favouring the intervention. Perceptions of peer smoking were also pooled from two studies which did not show a significant result (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> study which was the largest containing six countries could not be included in the meta-analyses due to the exclusion of baseline smokers from further follow up, as such a comparison to the other studies included in this review cannot be made. At 12-months follow up the intervention groups from Spain and the UK reported significant results favouring the control for 'intentions to smoke in the next year', whilst the remaining four countries showed no significant effect. However at 24-months follow up a significant effect in favour of the control was only seen in The Netherlands, while a beneficial effect was seen in Portugal. This changed again at 30-months follow up with a beneficial effect in Portugal as well as the UK, whilst no significant differences were seen in the remaining four countries. The experimental group was significantly less convinced of the pros of smoking (or cons of not-smoking) compared to the control group in one out of six countries at 12 months, three out of six counties at 24 months (resulting in an overall effect in favour of the intervention p&lt;0.05) and two out of six countries at 30 months (also see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-06-15 14:58:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Twenty-five studies evaluating the effectiveness of community interventions met the inclusion criteria for this review, representing a diverse set of interventions. Five focused on reducing specific health risk factors for cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>) or cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>) with influencing smoking behaviour as a secondary component of the programme, seven studies combined tobacco prevention with either reduction or cessation initiatives (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>) whilst the remaining thirteen focused exclusively on influencing smoking behaviour including prevention initiatives.</P>
<P>Of these 25 studies, ten were associated with a reduction in the uptake of smoking amongst young people (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>). Common features to these successful programmes include nine of the ten incorporating school based multi-component interventions with intervention delivery by school teachers and other faculty members, six had parental involvement in the intervention programme, eight had intervention durations longer than 12 months and nine of the ten interventions were based on the social influences or social learning theory. The exception was <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK> which used the social development model (<LINK REF="REF-Catalano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catalano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 2008</LINK>). However the development of programmes to influence smoking behaviour with theoretical concepts exclusively based on the social influences approach, has been criticised in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Bauman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>), with suggestions that indirect peer pressure may be just as effective to prevent peer smoking. Five of the seven studies combining tobacco prevention with either reduction or cessation initiatives were successful in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>). Three of the five studies which included community leader participation with active involvement in both the development and ongoing support of the community programmes were also effective in reducing youth smoking (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>), however the remaining two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK> (for the Age Appropriate intervention) and <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK> showed significant benefits in favour of the control. Five of the nine studies including mass-media as additional programme components favoured the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Pentz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pentz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eight of the 13 unsuccessful programmes had intervention durations of 12 months or less with a mean of 2.5 years for the remaining seven studies. Community leader involvement in both the development and ongoing support for the programmes occurred in one of the 13 unsuccessful studies, with <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK> being the exception. However the primary focus of the <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK> study was cancer prevention, as such the community leader involvement was not primarily focused on influencing youth smoking behaviour. Seven of the unsuccessful programmes also used the social influences model, three used community action/organisation theory (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK>) and five used other theories, for example office system's approach (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>), modifiable risk factors to influence youth smoking (<LINK REF="STD-Baxter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baxter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>), social acceptance (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2008</LINK>) or an unclear theoretical basis (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1997</LINK>). Four of the thirteen unsuccessful campaigns used mass media as a programme component, four had peer involvement to act as role models and deliver programme components, thirteen involved school based intervention components and ten included parent participation. A suggestion has been made that the most substantial increases in adolescent tobacco use occur later in high school and as such, parental communication has its impact not on the age of first experimentation but rather on later regular use (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>). Therefore, investigations of young cohorts which use parental influences for the prevention intervention, should continue follow up into high school for a more accurate example of parental influences on smoking prevention. Five of the successful studies used peers as role models, in comparison to four of the thirteen unsuccessful studies. According to current literature the perceived prevalence of smoking in the community influences youth smoking behaviours, which was confirmed in the <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK> study. In this study, authors report that the influence of friends' smoking status rendered a more powerful influence on smoking behaviour that the programme policy alone. Youth with close friends who smoked were more likely to smoke than youth with no close friends who smoke, which was consistent with the <LINK REF="STD-De-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Vries 2003</LINK> study.</P>
<P>The lack of community leader involvement, mass media intervention components and peer influences to support the community interventions, such as those in the successful campaigns, likely attributes to the eventual failure in influencing youth smoking behaviour, in these unsuccessful programmes.</P>
<P>One of the two studies which produced a negative effect for smoking prevalence, (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2001</LINK>), had a focus of cancer prevention; with influencing youth and adult smoking behaviour as secondary components. Methodological flaws such as small sample size, lack of biological validation for abstinence, nonsensical responses in surveys and lower consent rates in the second cross-sectional survey are discussed, however this does not necessarily provide a reason for the failing of the intervention programme. The authors do state a concern regarding process measures through school principal reports of anti-smoking activities in the past two years, which may provide some reasoning for the observed effect. No significant differences were found between treatment and control schools for reported activities, which suggests that many similar activities occurred in control towns and schools as happened in the intervention towns and schools. <LINK REF="STD-Piper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 2000</LINK> reported different effects on smoking prevalence between two different versions of an intervention, compared with a control group receiving standard health education. At three-year follow up monthly smoking in the Age Appropriate intervention was 36% (p&lt;0.01) compared to 30% in the control and 28% in the Intensive intervention. Authors suggest a number of explanations for these findings including: insufficient time available to effect cultural change, saturation of the prevention message by 8th grade (coined the 'fatigue factor'), implementation difficulties (only in the Age Appropriate arm), insufficient time and resources for the community level interventions, lack of intervention tailoring for specific sub-populations, multiple intervention messages which have different social meanings to different sub-groups and inadequate control as numerous health promotion and prevention programmes were run throughout the elementary and middle-school years.</P>
<P>Some dichotomy is emerging in the uptake of smoking between genders. As mentioned in the background, current reports indicate that smoking behaviour among adolescent girls is increasing over that of boys (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK> study did show a significant difference amongst boys in the D.A.R.E. Plus group compared to the controls for tobacco use, which was not present in the female population. This was also seen in the <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 2003</LINK> study. Authors state their findings strongly support the more widespread gender trend in which girls are nearly twice as likely as boys to be smokers in the early adolescent period. As a result consideration should be given to gender-specific prevention and cessation programmes during early adolescence in the future. It is also worth noting that there is an increasing trend in the use of bidi smoking, especially in India as per the <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2008</LINK> study. There is a misinformed notion amongst youth that bidi smoking (also spelled beedis or beedies) is less harmful than regular cigarettes as they look herbal due to the leaf wrapping and they come in a variety of flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mango, cherry etc. However, they do not contain filters like cigarettes and contain less tobacco but more nicotine (<LINK REF="REF-Rahman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahman 2000</LINK>). One study found that one bidi produced more than three times the amount of carbon monoxide and five times the amount of tar than one cigarette (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, they contain chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and phenol in greater quantities than normal cigarettes and to keep bidis lit, more frequent and deeper puffs are required in comparison to cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where possible we pooled pre-specified outcomes in meta-analyses, however these results should be considered with caution as some studies did not report in a way that allowed data to be included. Furthermore, we used the outcome at the final follow-up periods in these meta-analyses, with the exception of the sub-group 'Length of follow up 12 months or less'. Many studies provided data at multiple time periods. As a result some of the studies are not represented within these analyses and the outcomes may be misleading. Most of the studies which reported significant benefits could not be included in the meta-analysis. For this reason we recommend consideration be given to data presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> when interpreting each outcome.</P>
<P>When combining studies in the meta-analysis to measure smoking prevalence rates, significant heterogeneity was identified for a number of outcomes as determined via multiple sources including I-squared statistic, visual inspection of the data and characteristics of studies. Where appropriate, the analysis methods of outcomes were changed from the fixed effect to the random effect model as outlined in the methods. It has been recognised that community-wide programmes are especially difficult to evaluate (<LINK REF="REF-CART-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CART 1996a</LINK>) and that many community interventions have failed to meet the criteria for rigorous scientific evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-CART-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CART 1996b</LINK>). For example, there are particular difficulties in establishing adequate control groups (<LINK REF="REF-CART-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CART 1996a</LINK>). Communities (or large groups) have to be assigned to either intervention or control groups rather than individuals, which means that the analysis of outcomes should be at the level of the community rather than the individual. The unit of analysis however is often presented at the individual level due to the increased power supplied to the study, which in turn gives a greater chance of finding positive programme effects. Ignoring the correct unit of analysis may lead to spurious positive findings (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>). For example one study (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1994</LINK>) reported that if clustering had been ignored and the results had been based on the individual as the unit of analysis (without adjustment) then there would have been a spurious significant difference between the two groups, with the 2.4% net decline in smoking behaviour in the intervention state being reported as significant. One of the first community trials to employ GEE to address clustering problems was <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>. They have published another paper contrasting GEE with more common analytic methods using the data from <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>. Clustering was addressed in this meta-analysis through reducing the size of the trial to the effective sample size (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1992</LINK>) using the original sample size from each study, divided by a design effect of 1.2 which is consistent with other smoking cessation community intervention trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using youth within schools as sampling units may limit the generalisability of the findings. Only six studies did not use schools as the sampling unit (<LINK REF="STD-St-Pierre-1992" TYPE="STUDY">St Pierre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Onofrio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Onofrio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2009</LINK>). In one study all age-eligible persons within randomly selected households were sampled, therefore, increasing the likelihood of including young people at high risk for smoking who may be missed when students within schools are sampled. In their sample of 19 to 24 year-olds approximately ten per cent were high school drop-outs and their levels of smoking were significantly higher than those students completing high school (50% versus 20%) (<LINK REF="STD-Winkleby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winkleby 1993</LINK>). As the individuals sampled in most studies were predominantly students within schools, it is unclear how the results may generalise to young people outside of the school system. As mentioned in the results, nine studies did not adjust for clustering effects within the analysis, as such a manual adjustment for clustering was made using a published design effect (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite methodological problems common to several of the studies which met the inclusion criteria for this review, they represent the most rigorous set of studies available evaluating the effectiveness of community interventions in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. It is important to recognise that community programmes are influenced by local factors and are likely to be difficult to replicate exactly in other settings. However, the principles and methods upon which an effective intervention was based could be useful for programme implementation in similar settings.</P>

<P>Overall, there is some limited support for the effectiveness of community interventions in influencing smoking behaviour, including the prevention of smoking in young people. The following programme characteristics could be considered by individuals involved in planning future community programmes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>build upon elements of existing programmes (particularly those including multi-component school based interventions, parental involvement, intervention duration longer than 12 months and based on the social influences or social learning theory model), that have been shown to be effective rather than repeating methods that have achieved limited success;</LI>
<LI>programmes need to be flexible to the variability between communities so that the different components of a given programme can be modified to achieve acceptability;</LI>
<LI>developmental work with representative samples of those individuals to be targeted should be carried out so that appropriate messages and activities can be implemented;</LI>
<LI>programme messages and activities should be guided by a combination of theoretical constructs about how behaviours are acquired and maintained;</LI>
<LI>community activities must reach the intended audience if they are to stand any chance of success of influencing the behaviour of that audience;</LI>
<LI>consider the use of community leader involvement in the planning, development and ongoing implementation of community programmes, mass media as a source of message delivery, the use of peers as role models and specific programme components for boys and girls separately.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>The evaluation of community-wide campaigns to influence smoking behaviour is methodologically challenging, yet rigorous evaluation is required in order to demonstrate effectiveness. Careful planning of the evaluation is required, in terms of: analysis at the correct level, for example if communities are the unit of allocation then they should also be the unit of analysis or alternatively the unit of allocation should be accounted for in the analysis.</LI>
<LI>Measurement of appropriate outcomes: different levels of measurement should be planned, including behavioural, intermediate (or mediating) and process. The adequacy of implementation of each component of the intervention should also be recorded.</LI>

<P>programme<I> name: </I>Project 4-Health</P>
<P>
<I>Methods of Analysis: </I>GEE model using regression analysis to account and control for clustering effects; Pre-test data also were analysed separately for each post-test sub-sample to determine whether the experimental conditions were affected by participant attrition: this analysis used programme condition, post-test completion, and the interaction of these variables as factors; process variables included post-test outcomes: fidelity of implementation, positive adaptations, programme leader characteristics (e.g. communication skills, youth vs. adult programme leaders), member's attendance, and club size; Co-founders assessed with analysis of covariance controlling for pre-test differences on the post-test variable: In the individual-level analysis, age and gender were factors along with process measures; For the club-level analyses, individual-level data were aggregated to the club level to create separate files for boys and girls, separate analyses were then conducted for each gender as well as for all members</P>

<I>Intervention description: </I>Intervention communities received 6 CTC training sessions delivered over 6- to 12-months by certified CTC trainers; Community leaders created a community coalition of diverse stakeholders to implement CTC; They were trained to use survey data, prioritise risk factors to be targeted by prevention actions in the community, to choose tested and effective prevention policies and programmes that address the community&#8217;s targeted risk factors, to implement these interventions with fidelity, and to monitor implementation and outcomes of newly installed prevention programmes; The 12 intervention communities selected 13 different prevention programmes to implement during 2004-2005 school year, 16 programmes in 2005-2006 school year and 14 programmes during the 2006-2007 school year; On average 3 programmes were implemented per community annually; These programmes included school based programmes, community-based youth-focused programmes and family-focused programmes; Duration and intensity of each programme varied (also see 'Duration of intervention' below)</P>

<U>School based </U>programmes - All Stars Core: 14, 45-min weekly sessions; Life Skills Training: 12 (Level 1) and 8 (Level 2), 45-min weekly sessions; Lion&#8217;s Quest Skills for Adolescence: 40, 45-min weekly sessions; Project Alert: 11, 45-min weekly sessions; Olweus Bullying Prevention programme: Weekly, year-long classroom sessions</P>
<P>
<I>Intervention delivered by: </I>CTC trainers taught community leaders; Community Youth Development Study implementation staff provided technical assistance through weekly telephone calls, e-mails, and site visits to CTC communities at least once a year; Community leaders then implemented initiatives within their communities; local providers implemented local programmes including teachers for school programmes, health and human service workers for community-based, youth-focused, and family-focused programmes and community volunteers for Big Brothers Big Sisters and tutoring programmes</P>

<P>Prevalence of cigarette smoking in prior month: Using a random coefficients analysis for nested cross sectional design, the effect of the interventions were not significant. Using pair-wise analysis of the effect from time-1 to each of the follow-up points, the effects of the interventions were significant at times-2 (p=0.022) and -5 (p=0.038) and approached significance at time-4 (p=0.077, 2 tailed test). The effect was calculated as the difference in the change in prevalence from time-1 to the relevant time for the control condition, minus the same change for the school-based-only condition. At time-2 the net change was 4.5% (i.e., a larger decrease in community-participation areas), at time-4 it was 2.4%, and at time-5, 3.8%. Prevalence of smoking in school-based-only communities increased significantly from time-1 to each of the subsequent time points. There was no significant change in the community-participation condition, suggesting that the intervention prevented an increase in prevalence. There was no evidence that the community-participation and school-based-only communities differed on expired carbon monoxide at any time points.</P>

<P>Young people in the community-participation group reported more negative attitudes toward tobacco use (slope t(14 df)=2.31, p=0.036). Their awareness of efforts to prevent illegal sales became significantly more positive (slope t(14 df)=-2.31, p=0.036), Intentions to smoke over 5-years were significantly more positive for grade 9 males in school-based-only communities (slope t(14 df)=2.87, p=0.0124). At time-2 parents in community-participation communities perceived more town support for tobacco access restrictions (8 communities). By time-3 and -4, parents in the community-participation group were aware of more efforts to reduce youth access, and perceived greater town support for access restrictions. There were significant intervention effects over time on the perception of town support for tobacco prevention, and the support of business leaders. There was no evidence of an impact on perceived support from schools or government officials.</P>

However, the correlation between the cumulative number of activities over the 3-years of the intervention in each community and the community&#8217;s change in the prevalence of any tobacco use between time-1 and time-4 was significant, r=-0.75, p&lt;0.05.

<TD>
<P>Time-1 smoking prevalence was higher in community-participation groups (approximately 10%, adjusted for covariates) than in school-based-only groups (approximately 8%). This difference approached but did not reach significance. From time-1 to time-2 there was a marked drop in smoking prevalence in community-participation groups and increase in the school-based only communities. An analysis of the slope for prevalence (excluding the time-2 data) showed that the slopes did differ significantly (t(14)=-2.79, p=0.014), even when excluding the data points offering the strongest evidence for an effect. Communities had small populations and were mainly in rural areas. Only two communities had significant numbers of students from minority ethnic groups. Parents were offered a $10 incentive to complete the questionnaire.</P>

<P>Smoking behaviour: </P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>For time-1/time-2 (12-months) no overall effects for smoking behaviour were found using logistic regression.

<P>Intentions to smoke overall were not significant at any follow-up, though individual countries demonstrated varying results (some in favour of intervention, some control) across the three time-periods (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In one country (Spain), subjects were significantly less convinced of the advantages of smoking at 12-months compared to the control, however this effect was not seen in any other country as all the respondents perceived many disadvantages and believed that smoking had detrimental effects. As such there was no overall significant differences between intervention and control, which was also the case at 30-months follow-up. The experimental group at time-3 (24-months) however, were significantly less convinced of the pros of smoking than the controls (p&lt;0.05). By time-4 the experimental group were more confident in cigarette refusal (self-efficacy) than the control.</P>

<P>No between-group results were significant. 30-day smoking started and remained at very low levels throughout the 2-years; The highest group prevalence at any measurement period was 4.7% with 2.5% being the lowest. Smoking prevalence in those susceptible (susceptibility defined as a combination of outcomes designed by the authors) to smoking reduced by nearly 40% in the attention-control group and by 50% in the intervention group from baseline to 2-year follow-up. The overall reduction in subjects 'susceptible to smoking' from immediate post-intervention to 2-years was statistically significant (definition of susceptible subjects included those who were current smokers, did not show a firm resolve not to smoke, would accept a cigarette from a friend or intended to smoke in the next year). Older children were more likely to smoke and boys were significantly more susceptible than girls to smoking.</P>

<P>Thank you for your comments.</P>
<P>1) Why do you include non-randomised studies when you already have 15 randomised ones? Moreover, you do not seem to separate the two kinds in the funnel plots?</P>
<P>Originally when the review was conceived it was believed that the inclusion of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials combined would offer the readers with the best summary of evidence as it is sometimes quite difficult to randomise community level studies. Controlled clinical trials still have the potential to offer useful information pertaining to tobacco outcomes and as such were included. To take these difficulties into account this pre-specified methodology was carried out through to review completion despite the identification of a large number of randomised controlled studies so as not to introduce biases with changing approaches whilst conducting a review. However, as we are now approached another update for this review we agree with the comment and as such will be pre-specifying the exclusion of controlled clinical trials without randomisation. The funnel plots were not used to separate the differences between randomised and non-randomised controlled trials as again this was not a pre-specified approach. Funnel plots were only used in an attempt to identify selective reporting of studies as a whole. There are many tests that can be added on post hoc that we and many others would perhaps find interesting once the initial analyses are complete, however this introduces issues around selective reporting, which the pre-specified protocol aims to eliminate.</P>
<P/>
<P>2) The narrative summary/abstract is totally non-congruent with your own SoF.</P>
<P>This will be corrected in the update and a consumer representative will be utilised to ensure that all components of the review are consistent and clearly understood.</P>
