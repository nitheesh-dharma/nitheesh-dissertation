Why do you choose under 7 years for the a priori sub-group split? Do you have any lower age limit? I wonder if children under 2 or 5 might be different from older children as asthma is very hard to diagnose or exclude in this age-group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAckground: &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology [Chang 2001]. &amp;quot; Is this a widely accepted definition, I have changed to &amp;quot;has been defined as&amp;quot; in view of the fact that the reference is to work by the author of the review. Are you happy with this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;The assumption that all drop-out had a bad outcome is indeed conservative. I think this might be better as a sensitivity analysis rather than the primary method as it could be seen as biased against the treatment.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Children with non-specific cough (coughing not due to a diagnosed respiratory disease), are commonly treated with a variety of medications to treat the symptoms of cough. This review examined whether there was any evidence for children with non-specific cough to inhale cromoglycate and nedocromil (commonly called 'cromones'). There were no randomised controlled trials identified that assessed inhalation of cromones for prolonged non-specific cough in children. In two non-randomised studies, the researchers found that improvements were seen within two weeks of taking cromones. Because cromones have few adverse effects, they are an attractive treatment for children. However, there is no evidence to support their routine use for the symptoms of non-specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of this treatment is needed. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-20 10:48:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Cough is a very common symptom of respiratory disease . Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001)</LINK>. Children with a history of non-specific cough are commonly seen in paediatric practice. The majority have no signs of other current disease processes. In the absence of research to guide clinical practice, these children are treated with a variety of therapies: antibiotics, cough suppressants, anti-histamines, decongestants, bronchodilators, sodium cromoglycate, inhaled corticosteroids and oral corticosteroids, sometimes resulting in significant side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2002)</LINK>.</P>
<P>These children present a major management problem and cause considerable anxiety to parents. The desire by patients and medical practitioners to treat cough is reflected in the wide use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications for coughs and colds and the frequent prescription of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 1997</LINK>). Many children with non-specific cough are treated with asthma type medications (corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators). However, any beneficial effects of these interventions have not been clearly described.</P>
<P>Cromoglycate and nedocromil (commonly grouped together as cromones) are attractive medications as these medications are much less likely to cause significant side effects than inhaled corticosteroids and are alternative first line 'preventative' treatment in some asthma clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-National-Asthma-Guid" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Asthma Guid</LINK>). Nedocromil and cromoglycate increase cough threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Fontana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontana 2002</LINK>) and reduces neurogenic inflammation which is the most important peripheral inflammation process involved in human cough (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of inhaled cromones (cromoglycate and nedocromil) in treating children with non-specific cough. </P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All trials which included children under 18 years of age with prolonged (three or more weeks) non-specific cough (dry and non-productive cough without any other respiratory symptom, sign or systemic illness). An a priori subgroup analysis was planned for children &lt; seven years of age.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: cough related to mycoplasma, pertussis and chlamydia, presence of underlying cardio-respiratory condition, current or recurrent wheeze (&gt;2 episodes), presence of other respiratory symptoms (productive cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea), presence of other respiratory signs (clubbing, chest wall deformity, respiratory noises such as wheeze on auscultation and other adventitious sounds), presence of any sign of systemic illness (failure to thrive, aspiration, neurological or developmental abnormality) or presence of lung function abnormality. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All randomised controlled comparisons of cromones versus placebo medication in the management of non-specific cough.

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 11:06:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>From the title, abstract, or descriptors, two reviewers (ABC, JM) independently reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. From the full text using specific criteria, the same two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion. It was planned that agreement be measured using kappa statistics, and disagreement resolved by consensus or third party adjudication (PM). ABC wrote to Aventis Pharma Pty Ltd, the Australian representative for nedocromil and cromoglycate. In all subsequent searches to date, no new studies were fulfilled inclusion criteria. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Koskela-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Koskela 2005</LINK>) was added to the excluded studies table.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 11:06:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria would have been reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible children), inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of anti-cholinergic therapy, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data would have been extracted on the outcomes described previously. Further information would have been requested from the authors where required.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-20 10:47:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Studies included in the review would have undergone quality assessment performed independently by all reviewers. Risk of bias in included studies would have been assessed as either high, low or unclear risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), and the following headings 1) sequence generation; 2) allocation concealment; 3) blinding; 4) incomplete outcome data; 5) selective outcome reporting; 6) other bias. Inter-reviewer reliability for the identification of high quality studies for each component would have been measured by the Kappa statistic.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-07-20 05:16:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, relative and absolute risk reductions would have been calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies would have examined whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This would take into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>
<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest would have been included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) were to be calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan Analyses 1.0.1). The number needed to treat was to be calculated using the summary odds ratio and the average control event rate described in the relevant studies. The cough indices were to be assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes can be estimated (weighted mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference was to be estimated. Any heterogeneity between the study results was to be described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test (where p &lt; 0.1 is considered significant) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random effects model was to be included whenever there are concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>The Airways Group specialised register/search identified 500 potentially relevant titles (original search). After assessing the abstracts, 33 studies were considered for inclusion into review including two articles in German and one in Italian that were translated. No study fulfilled the study eligibility criteria. The main reason for non-eligibility of study criteria was presence of lung function abnormality consistent with unequivocal asthma or asthma-like conditions (at least 15% reversibility demonstrated on forced expiratory flow) in the subjects studied. Update searches have identified studies which we have excluded on the basis of age (<LINK REF="STD-Pashkova-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pashkova 2000</LINK>; adult participants), and lack of clarity regarding study design and entry criteria (authors from <LINK REF="STD-Keseloglu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keseloglu 2000</LINK> were contacted but we did not receive a response from them). Seven other studies were excluded for reasons listed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. The pharmaceutical company did not have any additional or unpublished data (20th Nov 2003). A new search was run in July 2010 and returned 65 references, but no new studies that met the eligibility criteria of this review were identified.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>No randomised controlled trials of inhaled cromones for the treatment of persistent non-specific cough in children were identified. A single arm open trial in children with chronic cough (&gt;four weeks), some of whom also had asthma (undefined) reported clinical response measured by cough severity diary (undefined whether it was parent or child-completed diary) within two weeks of therapy with inhaled nedocromil (4 mg, four times a day via metered dose inhaler and spacer) (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2001</LINK>). A small study on 10 adults reported significant improvement in cough sensitivity to capsaicin and subjective cough severity when taking inhaled sodium cromoglycate using metered dose inhaler with spacer (10 mg four times a day for two weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1995</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>With the absence of evidence (as opposed to evidence of no effect) use of inhaled cromones in children with prolonged non-specific cough cannot be routinely recommended. If cromones were to be trialed in these children, current data suggest a clinical response (subjective cough severity) within two weeks of therapy. The advantage of using inhaled cromones over other commonly therapy (inhaled or oral corticosteroids, beta-2-agonists, over the counter cough suppressants etc) include the lack of adverse events but the disadvantage is its frequent dosing (four times a day). </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomised controlled studies using objective and subjective outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of inhaled cromones for symptomatic control of prolonged cough in children with non specific cough are needed. </P>
