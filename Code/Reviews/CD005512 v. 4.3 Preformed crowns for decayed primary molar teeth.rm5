<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-23 19:31:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>To stop further damage and restore function of primary molar teeth that are decayed or malformed, a dentist will usually use a filling (a soft material that is placed in the cavity and hardened) to restore the tooth to its original shape. Alternatively the dentist may place a crown over the tooth to cover it. This usually requires an injection in the gum to numb the tooth before trimming it down (conventional technique). These crowns are pre-made (i.e. preformed) in a variety of sizes and can be metal or white, with the correct size being chosen to fit the trimmed down tooth. The Hall Technique is an alternative method for fitting metal crowns, where there is no need for an injection or tooth trimming as the crown is simply pushed over the tooth. Preformed crowns are recommended by specialists in children's dentistry for the management of baby back teeth (molars) when they are affected by moderate to advanced tooth decay, or where the enamel has malformed during development or the tooth has had to have root canal treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This Cochrane review asked whether crowns are better than other ways of managing decay in children's baby teeth for reducing 'major failure' (an outcome that includes aspects such as toothache and dental abscess), pain during treatment and harm, and for improving satisfaction with treatment. It also asked whether metal or white crowns were better and whether a new fitting method called the Hall Technique was better than the conventional fitting technique. The review updates one originally published in 2007.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them.</P>
<P>Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non-restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non-restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non-restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better.</P>
<P>
<B>Author's conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-23 17:36:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007.</P>

<P>
<B>Primary objective</B>
</P>
<P>To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non-restorative caries treatment or no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary objective</B>
</P>
<P>To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-12-23 17:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; <I>The Cochrane Library,</I> 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-12-23 17:38:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non-restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns.</P>
<P>For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively').</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-12-23 16:07:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-23 19:26:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non-restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique).</P>
<P>We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs.</P>
<P>
<I>Crowns versus fillings</I>
</P>
<P>All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies).</P>
<P>Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Crowns versus non-restorative caries treatment</I>
</P>
<P>Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non-restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates.</P>
<P>
<I>Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns</I>
</P>
<P>One split-mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-24 08:59:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-12-22 14:59:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries (tooth decay) affects around 60% to 90% of children globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Report-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Report 2003</LINK>). It most commonly occurs in primary (baby) molar (back) teeth. If left unmanaged, dental caries will progress to give pain and infection, the consequences of which are unnecessary suffering, and lost days at school (<LINK REF="REF-Gift-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gift 1992</LINK>). There is evidence of a linear relationship between higher levels of caries and anthropometric outcomes (height, weight and body mass index (BMI)) (<LINK REF="REF-Alkarimi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alkarimi 2014</LINK>). Untreated dental caries has an adverse effect on children's ability to grow and thrive (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2006</LINK>), and in underweight children, extraction of severely carious primary teeth can improve weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Monse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monse 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Teeth undergo a constant process of demineralisation (caused by the acids and enzymes produced by cariogenic bacteria in the dental biofilm (plaque)) and remineralisation (from protective factors such as fluoride and salivary components). Dental caries occurs when the rate of demineralisation is greater than that of remineralisation. When dissolution of enamel and dentine leads to cavitation (a hole in the tooth), the carious lesion can no longer be cleaned and it becomes more difficult to arrest the caries process as the biofilm becomes more sheltered, which favours the cariogenic bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Fejerskov-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fejerskov 2015</LINK>). This is when a restoration (filling) is usually considered necessary, to protect vulnerable tissue and to allow the tooth tissue to be able to be cleaned again.</P>
<P>Primary molar teeth can also be affected by conditions that disrupt the development of the dental hard tissues (i.e. hypoplasia, hypomineralisation, dentinogenesis imperfecta, amelogenesis imperfecta). These reduce the integrity and strength of the tooth and therefore, its longevity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Materials for managing primary molar teeth with decay or developmental defects</HEADING>
<P>Restorations that can be provided can either be filling materials or preformed crowns. Traditionally, preformed crowns have been made of metal and referred to as either preformed metal crowns (PMCs) or stainless steel crowns. They are silver in colour. More recently, aesthetic preformed crowns have been developed and used for primary teeth, which are white in colour. For the purposes of this review, the term 'crown' will be used when referring to preformed crowns of any type, while 'PMC' is used specifically to refer to preformed crowns made of metal and 'aesthetic crown' used specifically to refer to preformed crowns with a non-metallic appearance.</P>
<P>Fillings can be made of amalgam or various tooth-coloured materials (resin composite, compomers, resin-modified glass ionomer, glass ionomer) . There is very little high quality evidence to support the use of one type of restoration over another for primary teeth. A Cochrane Review that examined the use of filling materials in primary teeth was able to include only two studies of direct filling comparisons and was unable to draw conclusions about which was better (<LINK REF="REF-Yengopal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yengopal 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>Current guidelines from both the American Association of Paediatric Dentistry (<LINK REF="REF-AAPD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPD 2014</LINK>), and the British Society for Paediatric Dentistry (<LINK REF="REF-Kindelan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindelan 2008</LINK>), recommend treating dental decay in primary molar teeth by removing carious tissue before restoring the tooth with either a filling or a crown. These guidelines indicate that crowns are appropriate where &#8220;more than two surfaces are affected, or where one or two surface caries are extensive&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Kindelan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindelan 2008</LINK>), and they may also be indicated for &#8220;restoration of primary molars affected by localised or generalised developmental problems, e.g. enamel hypoplasia, amelogenesis imperfecta, dentinogenesis imperfecta&#8221;.</P>
<P>Placement of a preformed crown is intended to provide a more durable restoration than a filling. The process of preparing a tooth for filling materials can leave it structurally weak, as carious tissue needs to be removed from the cavity to allow a restoration to be placed. Additionally, sound tissue may need to be removed to gain access to the carious tissue. Furthermore, for certain filling materials, such as amalgam, the cavity has to be prepared to an 'ideal' shape to allow the incorporation of a mechanical resistance form and so prevent loss of the restoration. Re-establishing the original form of primary molar teeth with a filling material can be difficult, particularly with multi-surface cavities. The increased occlusal loading that multi-surface fillings are subjected to, often leads to premature restoration failure. Using atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) and selective carious tissue removal, the tooth can be prepared for a filling without the need for local anaesthetic; however, ART restorations have shorter lifespans in multisurface restorations than in single surface ones (<LINK REF="REF-Frencken-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frencken 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conventionally, preparing a primary tooth for a crown requires complete removal of carious tissue and trimming the tooth for the crown to fit, under local anaesthesia. This approach is used by specialists in paediatric dentistry and considered &#8220;subject to minimal technique sensitivity during placement" (<LINK REF="REF-Seale-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seale 2002</LINK>). However, PMCs are rarely placed by general dental practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Maggs_x002d_Rapport-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggs-Rapport 2000</LINK>), as they are viewed as demanding more skill on the part of the dentist and co-operation on the part of the child patient than is required for placing a filling (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 2007</LINK>). There is evidence that general dental practitioners' (GDPs) reluctance to use PMCs as part of their routine treatment may be related more to factors such as perceived difficulties in placing PMCs and funding issues (<LINK REF="REF-Maggs_x002d_Rapport-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggs-Rapport 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Threlfall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Threlfall 2005</LINK>), rather than doubts about whether PMCs are an effective restoration. There is another, more recent method for placing PMCs, which is less invasive, called the 'Hall Technique'. In this no local anaesthesia is used, no carious tissue is removed and no tooth preparation carried out, but the PMC is pushed over the tooth and the decay sealed in (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>). However, this does not overcome the disadvantage of the aesthetics of the metal crowns in children&#8217;s mouths (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-Page-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster Page 2014</LINK>). The use of aesthetic (white) crowns for children&#8217;s back teeth is of growing interest, but they are not yet commonly used. It is unlikely that aesthetic crowns would be able to be fitted using the non-invasive Hall Technique approach, as pushing the crown over the tooth without preparation relies on being able to distort the metallic leading edge of the crown slightly during placement. Although aesthetic crowns are made of a variety of materials, these are all rigid and have no ability to distort.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Techniques for managing primary molar teeth with decay or developmental defects</HEADING>
<P>Dental interventions to manage dental decay and developmental defects can be challenging for children to cope with, and for clinicians to carry out successfully. There are different methods for managing carious tissue prior to providing a restoration (ART and selective carious tissue removal) and for fitting crowns (the Hall Technique) that do not require the use of local anaesthesia. A recent update of the Cochrane Review on carious lesion management supported selective carious tissue removal methods in primary teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Ricketts-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricketts 2013</LINK>). These newer approaches to carious lesion management have advantages over complete carious tissue removal that include reduction in pulp exposure without causing an increase in symptoms from the dental pulp in primary teeth. However, the evidence was insufficient to determine whether there was a difference in restoration longevity where selective carious tissue removal was carried out, apart from when PMCs were used with the Hall Technique, where longevity was improved. These newer techniques should be considered alongside conventional restorative approaches. The Hall Technique is an extension of the 'sealing in' decay approach where carious tissue is not removed. When teeth are affected by extensive developmental defects it is often necessary to cover them fully with a PMC to preserve their integrity. The Hall Technique has been used for primary molar teeth in this situation and does not require any of the defective tooth tissue to be removed, but simply covered with the crown. The Hall Technique method of using preformed metal crowns should be compared with fillings, non-restorative approaches and conventional crowns (metal or other materials).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alternative techniques to crowns and fillings</HEADING>
<P>In addition to managing teeth with crowns or fillings, non-restorative options for arresting the progress of decay in primary teeth have recently been advocated and are being investigated as cost-effective, non-invasive solutions for managing decay (<LINK REF="REF-Vermaire-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermaire 2014</LINK>). These approaches rely on control of the biofilm through its frequent and successful removal by toothbrushing and have been investigated in comparison to fillings and crowns (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Use of crowns</HEADING>
<P>Fitting a crown can be demanding in terms of both of clinical skill and child co-operation. In the UK, primary care dental practitioners do not routinely use crowns as part of their daily practice (<LINK REF="REF-Roshan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roshan 2003</LINK>). In addition, there are considerable variations in opinion about when to place crowns and when a filling would be more clinically appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Pair-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pair 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2003</LINK>). In a prescribed case scenario that investigated which restoration dentists would place on a decayed primary molar tooth, <LINK REF="REF-Blinkhorn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blinkhorn 2003</LINK> found that 88% of USA dentists would place a crown compared to 4% of UK respondents.</P>
<P>However, their use is still recommended in guideline documents as the restoration of choice for teeth with extensive cavitation, as well as for teeth with developmental defects (e.g. hypoplasia, hypomineralisation).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-12-23 16:39:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary molar teeth are usually restored to their previous anatomical form using filling materials. With multisurface cavities, there can be increased occlusal loading and this could be a cause of premature restoration failure. In view of this, current guidelines recommend placing a preformed crown. They cover primary molar teeth affected with moderate to severe dental carious lesions involving two or more surfaces completely, in order to provide a more durable restoration than simply placing a filling (<LINK REF="REF-AAPD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPD 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kindelan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindelan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seale-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seale 2015</LINK>). The PMC can be fitted either by using the 'conventional method' (where the carious tissue and the pulp are treated with an appropriate technique) or the Hall Technique, where the crown is simply pushed onto the tooth with no carious tissue removal, local anaesthesia or tooth preparation. Aesthetic crowns also cover the entire primary molar tooth, but always require tooth preparation to place them and may require additional tooth tissue removal to create sufficient space compared to PMCs. However, regardless of the materials that crowns are made of, or the method used to place them, it is generally believed that by encasing the tooth the structural integrity of the tooth is increased.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-12-23 15:53:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is little high quality comparative evidence to support the use of crowns over filling materials, or aesthetic crowns over metal ones. A narrative literature review found 14 studies that investigated comparison of PMCs in prospective or retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Attari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attari 2006</LINK>). The studies were scored for the degree to which they met certain criteria: no studies reached the A standard (meeting 100% of the criteria) or B1 (over 75% of the criteria), seven scored B2 (50% to 75%) and the remaining seven scored C (below 50%). Failure rates of PMCs were 1.9% to 30.3%, which was lower than for fillings, but the study designs and quality made it difficult to interpret the findings meaningfully. A systematic review that compared the durability of PMCs with amalgam fillings in primary molars found PMCs more effective (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 2000</LINK>). However, there was no analysis for heterogeneity within the review and Ismail and Sohn (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2002</LINK>), who reanalysed the data later using a random-effects model, noted that the 10 studies had a significant degree of heterogeneity and, although there was still an improved performance for PMCs compared with amalgam fillings, the extent of the improvement was reduced. Amalgam is now being used less often because of environmental concerns related to its disposal. With the advent and increasing use of more aesthetic, adhesive materials, the performance of crowns needs to be compared with these newer materials.</P>
<P>The previous version of this Cochrane systematic review focused only on conventional preformed metal crown placement compared with all fillings. However, there are several reasons for expanding the scope of the review further. New studies are available, and developments in the materials used to make aesthetic crowns for primary molar teeth - see <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Leith-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leith 2011</LINK> - have been stimulated by the profession and consumer (parent/carer mainly) concerns about appearance of PMCs (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Randall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 2002</LINK>). Different restorative filling materials now need to be compared, not only with the traditional PMCs and aesthetic crowns, but also with new techniques for placing PMCs and to non-restorative approaches to caries management.</P>
<P>There are a growing number of options for managing decay and developmental defects in primary teeth; different types of fillings, different types of crowns and different methods for managing carious tissues. There is a lack of clarity around the evidence comparing crowns with different filling materials, different crowns and other methods for managing decay. This makes it difficult for clinicians to decide on a course of action, and also to present patients with the information they need to make informed choices about how to restore a primary molar tooth in a child. This review will provide information on how these techniques compare.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group undertook an extensive prioritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles that were the most clinically important ones to maintain on the Cochrane Library. This review was identified as a clinically important priority title by the paediatric expert panel (<A HREF="http://ohg.cochrane.org/priority-reviews">Cochrane OHG priority review portfolio</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2015</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-12-22 15:08:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors undertook the assessment of the risk of bias in the included trials independently and in duplicate. The assessments were based on the information given in the articles and conducted using the standard recommended approach for assessing the risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool is available in Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), it assesses the following domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sequence generation;</LI>

<LI>blinding of outcome assessment;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>

<P>The review authors assigned a judgement for the risk of bias for each domain as being 'high', 'low' or 'unclear'. We based our judgements on the criteria for making judgements listed in Section 8.5 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, which focuses on whether the risk is of importance (i.e. whether the presence of the risk could have an important impact on the results or the conclusion of the trial) rather than whether a risk of bias is present or not (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>If insufficient detail about what happened in the study was reported, the judgement made was usually &#8216;unclear' risk of bias. An &#8216;unclear&#8217; judgement was also made if what happened in the study was known, but the risk of bias was unknown; or if an entry was not relevant to the study at hand (particularly for assessing blinding and incomplete outcome data, when the outcome being assessed had not been measured in the study).</P>

<P>In future updates, should continuous outcomes (such as mean visual analogue scores (VAS)) be reported, we will use mean differences and standard deviations. We will use standardised mean difference (SMD) as a summary statistic in meta-analysis when the studies all assess the same outcome, but measure it in a variety of ways (for example, all studies measure pain but use different psychometric scales).</P>

<P>Apart from simple parallel randomised control trials (where the unit of randomisation is at the individual level), it was also possible to have 'split-mouth' studies, in which different areas of the mouth are assigned different interventions. When split-mouth studies were included and each individual trial participant had one tooth randomised to the intervention and another randomised to the control, our analyses took into account the paired nature of the data (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>) .</P>
<P>For clustered data, in trials where the unit of randomisation was the tooth, and the number of teeth included in the trial was not more than twice the number of participants, the data were treated as if the unit of randomisation was the individual.

<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall 'quality of evidence' for each outcome assessed in this review, and used this approach in our interpretation and discussion of the findings of this review. The outcomes that are most relevant to patients and decision making are summarised in the 'Summary of findings' table, along with GRADE quality ratings (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are four possible ratings for the quality of evidence; 'high', 'moderate', low' and 'very low'. A rating of 'high quality' of evidence implies that we were confident in our estimate of effect and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of 'very low' quality implies that any estimates of effect obtained are very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach judges evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as being 'high quality'. The following factors decrease the quality of evidence:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Across the five trials, there were 438 child participants with 693 teeth.</P>
<P>Only three of the studies specified how many of the participants were boys and girls (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), with the breakdowns being quite even: 206 boys and 182 girls (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The ages of the participants were reported in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>), and ranged from two to 10 years. All studies only reported data from primary teeth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting and design</HEADING>
<P>The studies were set in Saudi Arabia (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>), the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>), the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>), Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>), and Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of the five included studies were of split-mouth design (<LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>), one was a parallel group study with only one tooth treated per child (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), and the other was a randomised trial with randomisation at tooth level (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>), although children could have more than one tooth treated and the clustering was not taken into consideration in the statistical analysis. The number of teeth was less than twice the number of participants and may have had a small effect on reduction of the size of confidence intervals; however, we did not consider that this would have a significant impact on the findings.</P>
<P>Two studies had a maximum of one-year of follow-up data (<LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), one had a two-year follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>), one had both six-month and four-year data (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>), and the last one had data available for one year, two years and five years (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>), all of the teeth had pulpotomies before the crowns or restorations were carried out.</P>
<P>In two of the studies, treatment was carried out by single operators (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>), and although there was no information about whether the operators were specialists, the studies were both set in dental clinics for children. In <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>, treatments were carried out by 12 dentists (seven specialists and five postgraduate trainees), in <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK> the treatments involved 17 general dentists in 10 primary care general practices. while the <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK> study did not specify who treated the children or how many clinicians there were.</P>
<P>Two studies compared PMCs with open sandwich restorations (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>). Both <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK> compared Hall crowns with fillings. However, the <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK> study included a third comparison arm of non-restorative caries treatment, which opened out cavities and taught parents to keep them clean and applied a fluoride varnish, and this arm was compared to both Hall crowns and fillings. In <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>, two types of crown were compared: a stainless steel one similar to the other studies, and an aesthetic one where a stainless steel crown had a composite veneer added to cover its facial, occlusal, mesial and distal aspects. A greater reduction in tooth surface was required for the aesthetic crown (around 1.5 mm) to allow for its greater thickness.</P>
<P>To summarise, the following were the comparisons and interventions used:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Clinical and radiographic outcomes were recorded in all five studies.</P>
<P>Four studies recorded clinical/radiographic measures of success, that is, where there was no pain, no signs or symptoms of infection, and where the restoration was intact (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>). These outcomes were grouped to give a composite measure of success.</P>
<P>Two of these studies grouped outcomes for clinical/radiographic failure into minor failure (restoration repaired or tooth managed with no pulpal intervention required) and major failure (irreversible pulpitis, periradicular periodontitis) (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study recorded use of a "modified US Public Health Service" scale for clinical characteristics of the restoration (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies measured gingival health. <LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK> measured bleeding on probing and <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK> recorded gingival swelling as 'none', 'mild' (with bleeding on probing) or 'moderate/severe' (with bleeding after air drying). <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK> only reported presence or absence of inflammation, but did not give data on bleeding.</P>
<P>Only one study measured bone resorption (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patient-reported outcomes were only investigated in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), with one study recording patient/parent and dentist treatment preferences (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>), and the other measuring the child&#8217;s discomfort and behaviour during treatment, and parent and dentist ratings of child&#8217;s discomfort and behaviour during treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>).These outcomes were reported as number of patients in each category of the scale. Different 5-point Likert scales were used to rate whether discomfort was experienced during the procedure. In <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>, the dentist(s) ratings based on this scale were: 1 no apparent discomfort; 2 very mild, almost trivial; 3 mild, not significant; 4 moderate, but child coped; 5 significant, unacceptable. For <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>, children rated pain on this scale as: 'very low', 'low', 'moderate', 'intense', or 'very intense'. For the purpose of analysis, we dichotomised these scales so that all children who rated 'moderate' and above were considered as having experienced discomfort.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>The interventions compared in the studies looked different (i.e. usually crowns compared with fillings or no fillings, or a metal crown compared with a white crown). It was therefore, not possible to blind the dentist and other personnel involved in providing care, or the participants and their parents. Whether the knowledge of which intervention the participant was getting was going to affect the care provided was not apparent and, in line with Cochrane guidance, we rated this domain for all trials as being at a high risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>There was a high risk of bias for outcome assessment for all the included trials, as the assessments of treatment success and failure could depend on various factors.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-23 19:26:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our aim was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of crowns compared with fillings, another type of crowns or method of crown placement, or non-restorative or no treatment approaches. We found five studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), which provided data on three out of the four comparisons of interest (crown versus filling; crown versus no crown/filling; metal crowns (PMC) versus aesthetic crowns).</P>
<P>Most of the evidence looked at the first comparison, crowns compared to fillings (four out of five studies). Crowns outperformed fillings for major failure and pain in the long term. There may be an increased risk of gingival bleeding; however, this result was inconclusive and its clinical relevance debatable. Data from two studies that used the Hall Technique showed that discomfort during treatment was lower for crowns than fillings.</P>
<P>The benefits and harms for crowns versus non-restorative caries treatment were uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. Only one study (analysing between 92 to 104 participants per outcome) evaluated this comparison, and this study reported no major failures in the metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique arm and four in the non-restorative arm within one year. The gingival bleeding risk may have been higher in the crowns group but the result was unclear. The risk of experiencing discomfort appeared to be higher in the PMC group, though this result was also unclear.</P>
<P>There was even less data for comparison of PMC versus aesthetic crowns; one very small study (11 pairs of teeth) reported only on gingival bleeding and bone resorption, with more gingival bleeding for the teeth with aesthetic crowns than for those with PMC.</P>
<P>Due to a lack of detail on the extent of the carious lesions, it was not possible to draw any conclusions concerning our secondary objective of determining whether the extent of decay had an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with PCs compared with fillings.</P>
<P>In summary, most of the findings in this review favoured crowns compared to conventional fillings, particularly when the Hall Technique was used. There were very limited data to assess whether crowns are better than non-restorative caries treatment. There were no data to assess the most effective technique for using crowns (conventional or Hall).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-12-23 17:32:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five studies in the review, however, this does not provide a complete picture for all comparisons, all outcomes and all timepoints. Nonetheless, crowns seemed to perform better than fillings, and the variability between the studies reinforces the applicability of this finding to different settings. Only one study compared crowns to non-restorative caries treatment and none compared different crown fitting techniques, so these comparisons lack evidence. The findings for metal crowns compared to aesthetic crowns was only for one particular type of white crown and, while there are now many others available, no randomised studies have compared them yet.</P>
<P>One of the studies was still ongoing at the time of publication of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), and only data from one of the three countries involved were available.</P>
<P>There were no data available from any of the studies that would allow us to investigate our secondary objective of determining the influence of the extent of carious lesions in a tooth on the clinical outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>For crowns versus fillings, we found five studies that compared preformed crowns against filling materials or non-restorative caries treatment, and included data from three studies in our primary meta-analysis of major failure in the long term. Only one study compared stainless steel crowns against aesthetic crowns. There were no studies that compared the Hall Technique with conventional crowns and this leaves the question of which of these crown-fitting methods is likely to be better.</P>
<P>Interpreting the data is complicated because of the relatively low number of studies and the degree of heterogeneity between the interventions. So although four studies investigated crowns, two looked at crowns using the Hall Technique and two looked at conventional crowns, but even within those two groups, there were other differences. In both of the studies that looked at conventional crowns (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>), crowns were placed on teeth that had undergone pulp treatment whereas none of the teeth in the Hall Technique studies had pulp treatments before the crowns were fitted. Each of the four studies used different types of filling materials in the control arm. Of the two studies of Hall Technique crowns, one was carried out by general dental practitioners (GDPs) in general dental practice (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>), and the other was carried out by specialists in a secondary care setting (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no standardisation and often poor reporting for the extent of carious lesion in the teeth included in the studies. One included teeth where the carious tissue involved at least two surfaces (<LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>), and one included a variety of carious lesions (although almost half of the lesions were more than half-way through dentine radiographically) (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>). Two of the studies included teeth where pulp treatment was carried out for extensive carious lesions or following pulp exposure (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>). One study did not report the extent of the carious lesion in the teeth (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>). This variation meant we could not investigate or draw conclusions about how extensive the carious lesion needs to be to result in an improved outcome from crowns over fillings.</P>
<P>Nevertheless in all cases, crowns performed either as well as, or better than, fillings. So the heterogeneity perhaps strengthens, rather than weakens the case for crowns improving outcomes for primary molar teeth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All but one of the studies included data on two of our primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>), major failures and pain. However, it is of note that none of them - even the study of PMCs compared with aesthetic crowns (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>) - reported on the third of our primary outcomes, which was satisfaction with treatment (which included satisfaction with aesthetics). This presents a gap in the evidence and is another example of the lack of patient-reported outcomes in clinical dental trials.</P>
<P>We did not find any studies that reported on 'time to restoration failure/retreatment' as an outcome. In the next update of this review, we will include 'minor failures', which will be a composite measure that includes restoration loss, fractured or worn restorations that need to be repaired or replaced, carious tissue around the margin of a restoration that needs to be repaired or the replacement of the restoration. These outcomes were reported in all of the studies to some extent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time points</HEADING>
<P>There was no common time point at which the studies could be compared. Since the studies measured so many different time points (six months, up to one year, up to two years, up to five years), and several of the studies reported data at several time points, combining the data to present a true picture of the comparisons proved problematic. To give the most realistic picture, we have presented data within the comparisons as up to 12 months (i.e. what is likely to happen in the short term) and then have combined the data for over 12 months (i.e. what is likely to happen in the long term). This has meant that the forest plots (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) contain data from studies where the data ranged from 0 to 12 months with studies that included data that ranged from 0 to 48 months. Whilst this is not ideal, and may introduce an unknown bias, we think this presents dentists and parents with evidence of how they can expect the different interventions to fare relatively in the short and long term.</P>

</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-12-23 17:33:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence was obtained from well conducted randomised controlled trials (split-mouth, and with tooth as unit of randomisation) with a generally low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment. However, the overall risk of bias for the studies was high, due to inadequate blinding and risks in attrition bias. In addition, there was imprecision as the study sizes were relatively small, and therefore large confidence intervals were observed.</P>
<P>For the comparisons of crowns against fillings, we downgraded all outcomes one level due to the lack of blinding, and gingival bleeding a second level due to imprecision. For the comparison of crowns fitted using the Hall Technique versus non-restorative caries treatment, we downgraded outcomes three levels for serious risk of bias and imprecision. The quality of evidence therefore ranged from moderate (we have moderate confidence in the estimate of the effect) to very low (we are very uncertain of the estimate of the effect).</P>
<P>Very little information was available for the comparison of metal versus aesthetic crowns, and we consider the quality of evidence for all the outcomes in this comparison - which came from only one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>) - as very low.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-12-23 16:34:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two of the review authors (NI, RS), were involved in two of the studies included (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santamaria-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Santamaria 2014</LINK>). However, data extraction and risk of bias assessment for these studies were performed by two other review authors and compared against data from another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Ricketts-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricketts 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many variations in the techniques and materials used in the type of interventions investigated in this review. Therefore, certain assumptions had to be made about whether data could be pooled, despite these variations. We had decided to investigate some variations as subgroups. These subgroups were determined a priori, and carried out as planned whenever data were available. However, the small number of studies available and the large confidence intervals observed in some studies means that these subgroup analyses are not likely to be of sufficient power to detect a difference. We made a priori decisions to pool data unless subgroup analyses showed a difference for certain variations in technique. For example, in our analysis of major failures, there was only one small study of conventional crown technique, which showed no difference between crowns and the conventional methods of restorations, whereas the studies using the Hall Technique seemed to show a large effect size. We pooled this as planned, but we may have to revisit the assumption when more data become available, and any potential heterogeneity or differences in effectiveness due to variations in technique may become more apparent.</P>
<P>Four out of the five included studies used teeth as the unit of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>), and paired split-mouth randomisation was conducted in three of these (<LINK REF="STD-Hutcheson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hutcheson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2003</LINK>). As planned in the protocol, we conducted adjustments for the split-mouth design using the generic inverse variance technique, and tested whether the adjustments had an impact on the effect estimate obtained. We found minimal or no difference (a maximum difference of odds ratio 0.02) and took the pragmatic approach of reporting the results without adjustments, using relative risk as the effect estimate for ease of interpretation.</P>
<P>Another study contained clustered data with 47 children having more than one molar treated in the study, but no further information was given (<LINK REF="STD-Atieh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Atieh 2008</LINK>); this meant we could not determine the extent of the clustering (some children could have had up to eight molars treated with crowns). Because of the uncertainty around the effect this would have on the meta-analyses, we initially excluded this study when the analyses with adjustments were conducted. After deciding to present results without adjustments, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to see whether the inclusion of the study affected the meta-analysis results. There were no real impacts on the conclusions drawn, therefore the results of this study were included. In future updates of this review when more studies are available for inclusion, the impact of adjustments required for clustering should be revisited and a pragmatic decision taken on whether to continue presenting the unadjusted results.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-12-23 16:12:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is interesting to note that in the following excluded studies (where allocation method was reported), there was a general bias towards placing PMCs on teeth with more extensive carious lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2005</LINK>), or where there was less remaining tooth structure (<LINK REF="STD-Holan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holan 2002</LINK>), and both Eriksson and Holan both reported reported greater success rates for the crowned teeth.</P>
<P>In Randall's systematic review of the literature, comparing PMCs with amalgam, it was noted that, despite the heterogeneity of the 10 studies included, there was a positive outcome in all studies in favour of the PMC compared with amalgam restorations (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 2000</LINK>). However, there were no RCTs available for inclusion in the review and the potential for bias must be taken into consideration.</P>
<P>Only one study has compared the Hall Technique to conventional crowns; this was a retrospective study of one specialist practitioner's records that assessed the clinical and radiographic success of both techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 2014</LINK>). Failure was defined as a lost crown and/or the requirement for further treatment for carious tissues or pulp pathology, clinically or radiographically. There was a high degree of success for both techniques (97% for the Hall Technique, mean follow-up 15 months and 94% for conventionally placed crowns, mean follow-up 52 months) and no statistically significant difference between them.</P>
<P>One study compared one type of aesthetic crown with another (<LINK REF="STD-Leith-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leith 2011</LINK>). This study was excluded because the crowns were essentially the same (with the same metal framework) and the method for placing them was the same. They differed only in the method by which the white facing adhered to the underlying crown and showed equally successful outcomes for intact facings, gingival inflammation, radiographic success and parental satisfaction for success.</P>
<P>A recent comprehensive systematic review of the literature around the use of PCs agreed with the findings of our review, and concluded that metal crowns (fitted conventionally or using the Hall Technique) and aesthetic crowns had superior clinical performance as restorative options for primary molar teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Seale-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seale 2015</LINK>). The review included reports on 22 clinical studies, three case reports, 21 reviews and surveys and 13 in vitro studies on all types of crowns for both primary and permanent molar teeth. Although an assessment of the quality of the literature was carried out, this was not done through use of a recognised tool. No meta-analysis was carried out, but the authors reported assigning weighting criteria to the reports that assessed clinical research with a threshold for inclusion of 60%. How the quality assessment, weighting criteria and threshold were derived is not clear.</P>

<P>Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or where pulp treatment has been carried out, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-12-23 16:12:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The population investigated included only fit and healthy children. The performance of restorative interventions is important for children with special needs and may be different in those children with limited ability to tolerate invasive dental procedures. This should be considered when designing future trials and considering generalisability of findings. As most restorative procedures in children are undertaken by non-specialists, these clinicians should be included in future research to improve generalisability of the results.</P>
<P>Future research should include discomfort at the time of treatment and pain following treatment. Reporting should include adequate detail about how these were assessed and who reported them, as well as consideration of the multi-dimensionality of pain and its expression, especially with children.</P>
<P>There were no studies that compared the Hall Technique to conventional crowns. So, although crowns outperformed fillings, it is not possible to say whether crowns should be fitted conventionally (involving local anaesthesia and removal of tooth substance), or fitted less invasively. This is an important question in terms of best clinical outcome (fewer major failures and less gingival bleeding), as well as from children's and parents' perspectives, and that of cost. There was very little measurement and reporting of patient-reported outcomes. Only the two trials that involved the Hall Technique investigated pain or discomfort at time of treatment. The studies investigated adverse events in a limited way, with gingival bleeding measured in three studies and bone resorption in one, but other adverse events, as well as cost and satisfaction with treatment, were not investigated. A core outcome set is not available yet for trials investigating restorative interventions, but would be helpful to guide researchers in the design of trials and would improve the ease of comparing and collating findings. Longer follow-up in studies should be considered. We found no studies that investigated the management of primary teeth with developmental defects. These should also be investigated in the future, as well as the implications of the depth of carious lesions.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-12-23 17:33:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following a prioritisation project carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, a decision was taken to expand the scope of the review. The earlier protocol only included studies with preformed metal crowns (PMCs). The current protocol includes studies using any type of crown material, compared to usual restoration methods or non-restorative caries treatment.</P>
<P>We have broadened the objectives for this updated review compared to the 2008 version (<LINK REF="REF-Innes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Innes 2007</LINK>). In the previous version, in the first objective we compared only PMCs with commonly used filling materials. This updated version has widened to include all preformed crowns (metal and aesthetic) compared to the same commonly used filling materials, and also non-restorative caries treatment, as well as comparisons between different types of crowns and different methods for placing crowns. The second objective of the previous version of the review compared whether the extent of decay had an effect on outcome; this has not changed apart from now including all of the interventions in our first objective. The third objective in the original version of the review, dealt with adverse events and safety and this has now been incorporated into our first objective in this review.</P>
<P>We have also updated the outcomes. In the original review the primary outcomes were: freedom from clinical or radiographic signs or symptoms of pulp pathology including pain/pulp infection/discharging sinus/swelling; time until filling or crown needs to be replaced or requires further intervention; and proportion of filled or crowned teeth retained until appropriate age of shedding. We had included other measures of success: absence of clinical or radiographic evidence of secondary caries; other clinical signs of pathology (fracture of tooth or filling, wear of crown, inflammation of gingival (gum) tissue); patient satisfaction; costs to patient and provider; and adverse events. To reduce the number of outcomes but still maintain the applicability of the findings, we have used 'major failure', as a primary outcome. This is a composite outcome measure made up of different clinical and radiographic findings and comprises a number of outcomes from the previous review. Clinically, this is a reasonable outcome, as it requires the same treatment to manage. Our other two primary outcomes are pain and satisfaction with treatment (including satisfaction with aesthetics). The secondary outcomes were rationalised to: time to restoration failure/retreatment; peri/postoperative discomfort/pain; cost; and adverse events (e.g. bone loss, gingival inflammation or others).</P>
<P>In our protocol, we had planned to conducted adjustments for the study designs where within-patient randomisation was conducted and investigate any impact of clustering. We conducted these analyses in our review using generic inverse variance as planned, but decided to present the results without adjustment. This decision is based on the fact that the adjustments did not make a real difference to the effect estimates obtained, and took into account the easier interpretability of unadjusted results in the usual dichotomous outcome format for clinicians. In future versions of this review we will revisit this decision on the basis of the data obtained.</P>
<P>We did not calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as we had planned to.</P>

Study stated that "characteristics of participants who left during the study were comparable to those who remained in the study." Main reasons for dropout were in general: failure to return 67% (n = 14) or participants moved to another city/country 33% (n = 7) (information obtained from study authors)</P>
