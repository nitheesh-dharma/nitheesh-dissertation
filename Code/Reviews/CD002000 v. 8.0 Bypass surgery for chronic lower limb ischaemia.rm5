<TITLE>Bypass surgery for chronic lower limb ischaemia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-22 09:57:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Background</P>
<P>The most common symptom of chronic lower limb ischaemia (inadequate blood flow to the legs) is claudication, a cramping pain caused by a poor supply of blood to the affected muscle. It often affects the calf muscle, and is typically triggered by exercise and relieved by rest. More severe restriction of the blood supply may produce pain at rest, leg ulcers, or gangrene. These conditions, and severe claudication, may require bypass surgery or other treatments to improve blood flow to the leg.</P>
<P>Key results</P>
<P>This review of eleven trials with a total of 1486 participants (current until October 2016) identified six trials comparing bypass surgery with angioplasty (balloon stretching and/or stent of the narrowed or occluded artery), and one each with remote endarterectomy (a combination of plaque removal and stent), thromboendarterectomy (removal of the plaque and clot), thrombolysis (clot dissolving), exercise, and spinal cord stimulation. In this review, no evidence was found to favour bypass surgery over angioplasty in terms of the effect on death, improvement of symptoms, amputation rate, need for further procedure, or long-term mortality. Procedural complications occurred more frequently in patients with severe leg ischaemia (rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene) undergoing bypass surgery than those undergoing angioplasty. There was evidence that bypass surgery was more often technically successful, was associated with longer hospital stay, and that the bypass graft remained open (patent) at a higher rate one year after the procedure compared with angioplasty; this difference in patency in favour of surgery disappeared after four years. There was also no clear evidence to favour bypass surgery compared with other treatments, as indicated by procedural complications and deaths, clinical improvement, vessel patency, and long-term mortality. Comparisons of bypass surgery with thrombolysis showed fewer amputations in patients subjected to bypass surgery, whereas for the rest of the comparisons the amputation rate was similar.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence</P>
<P>In general, the quality of the evidence was high for all but two of the clinically most important outcomes. Quality of the evidence for clinical improvement was judged to be low as this was a subjective outcome at risk of bias since the outcome assessors were not blinded to the study treatments and because there were differences in results between the studies. Quality of the evidence for patency of the bypass graft was moderate because of differences in results between the studies. Further research including large numbers of participants is needed to investigate the effectiveness of bypass surgery for chronic lower limb ischaemia.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-22 09:55:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected 11 trials reporting a total of 1486 participants. Six trials compared bypass surgery with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and one each with remote endarterectomy, thromboendarterectomy, thrombolysis, exercise, and spinal cord stimulation. The quality of the evidence for the most important outcomes of bypass surgery versus PTA was high except for clinical improvement and primary patency. We judged the quality of evidence for clinical improvement to be low, due to heterogeneity between the studies and the fact that this was a subjective outcome assessment and, therefore, at risk of detection bias. We judged the quality of evidence for primary patency to be moderate due heterogeneity between the studies. For the remaining comparisons, the evidence was limited. For several outcomes, the CIs were wide.</P>
<P>Comparing bypass surgery with PTA revealed a possible increase in early postinterventional non-thrombotic complications (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.73; six studies; 1015 participants) with bypass surgery, but bypass surgery was associated with higher technical success rates (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.44; five studies; 913 participants). Analyses by different clinical severity of disease (intermittent claudication (IC) or CLI) revealed that peri-interventional complications occurred more frequently in participants with CLI undergoing bypass surgery than PTA (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.24). No differences in periprocedural mortality were identified (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.19; five studies; 913 participants). The primary patency rate at one year was higher after bypass surgery than after PTA (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.14; four studies; 300 participants), but this difference was not shown at four years (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.78; two studies; 363 participants). No differences in clinical improvement (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.03 to 14.52; two studies; 154 participants), amputation rates (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.87; five studies; 752 participants), reintervention rates (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.37; three studies; 256 participants), or mortality within the follow-up period (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.25; five studies; 961 participants) between surgical and endovascular treatment were identified. No differences in subjective outcome parameters, indicated by quality of life and physical and psychosocial well-being, were reported. The hospital stay for the index procedure was reported to be longer in participants undergoing bypass surgery than in those treated with PTA.</P>
<P>In the single study (116 participants) comparing bypass surgery with remote endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery, the frequency of early postinterventional non-thrombotic complications was similar in the treatment groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.34). No mortality within 30 days of the index treatment or during stay in hospital in either group was recorded. No differences were identified in patency (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.46), amputation (OR 1.70, 95% CI 0.27 to 10.58), and mortality rates within the follow-up period (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.48). Information regarding clinical improvement was unavailable.</P>
<P>No differences in major complications (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.31) or mortality (OR 2.09, 95% CI 0.67 to 6.44) within 30 days of treatment between surgery and thrombolysis (one study, 237 participants) for chronic lower limb ischaemia were identified. The amputation rate was lower after bypass surgery (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.80). No differences in late mortality were found (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.44). No data regarding patency rates and clinical improvement were reported.</P>
<P>Technical success resulting in blood flow restoration was higher after bypass surgery than thromboendarterectomy for aorto-iliac occlusive disease (one study, 43 participants) (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0 to 0.17). The periprocedural mortality (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.65), follow-up mortality (OR 3.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 85.44), and amputation rates (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.91) did not differ between treatments. Clinical improvement and patency rates were not reported.</P>
<P>Comparing surgery and exercise (one study, 75 participants) did not identify differences in early postinterventional complications (OR 7.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 137.76) and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.31). The remaining primary outcomes were not reported. There was no difference in maximal walking time between exercise and surgery (1.66 min, 95% CI -1.23 to 4.55).</P>
<P>Regarding comparisons of bypass surgery with spinal cord stimulation for CLI, there was no difference in amputation rates after 12 months of follow-up (OR 4.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 63.95; one study, 12 participants). The remaining primary outcome parameters were not reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-10 12:19:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited high quality evidence for the effectiveness of bypass surgery compared with other treatments; no studies compared bypass to optimal medical treatment. Our analysis has shown that PTA is associated with decreased peri-interventional complications in participants treated for CLI and shorter hospital stay compared with bypass surgery. Surgical treatment seems to confer improved patency rates up to one year. Endovascular treatment may be advisable in patients with significant comorbidity, rendering them high risk surgical candidates. No solid conclusions can be drawn regarding comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatments because of the paucity of available evidence. Further large trials evaluating the impact of anatomical location and extent of disease and clinical severity are required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-10 09:25:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:23:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may present with acute limb ischaemia, chronic lower limb ischaemia is the most common presentation of PAD and results from an atherosclerotic process affecting the lower extremity arteries causing a reduction in the blood supply to the leg. Intermittent claudication (IC) is the most common presenting symptom for patients with PAD. It is thought to be produced by an inadequate supply of oxygen to the calf, thigh, or buttock muscles during exercise, resulting in anaerobic metabolism and pain. In its more severe manifestations, PAD may lead to critical limb ischaemia (CLI), which is characterised by intractable rest pain, ischaemic ulceration, or gangrene. Patients with CLI are at significant risk of developing irreversible ischaemic damage to the leg or foot if no appropriate treatment is undertaken, and this may result in amputation of the limb (<LINK REF="REF-Norgren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgren 2007</LINK>). In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the overall prevalence of symptomatic or asymptomatic PAD in individuals aged 40 years or older was 4.3%, with a dramatic increase with age, rising from 0.9% in those younger than 50 years to 14.5% in those 70 years or older (<LINK REF="REF-Selvin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvin 2004</LINK>). As well as having a detrimental impact on functional capacity and quality of life, PAD indicates a more widespread systemic atherosclerotic disease affecting arterial trees in different organ systems, such as the coronary and cerebral circulation.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-10 09:25:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The importance of identifying and appropriately treating patients with PAD lies in both the management of ischaemia, to relieve symptoms or prevent amputation, or both, and the control of atherosclerotic risk factors, life style modifications and optimal medical treatment to mitigate the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. Treatments for PAD range from conservative measures, such as management of cardiovascular risk factors with antiplatelets, statins, and exercise regimens, to interventional therapies, including surgical and endovascular arterial reconstruction.</P>
<P>Surgical bypass of the diseased arterial segment is one of the main treatments for the patient with life-limiting claudication or CLI. The type of bypass procedure in the lower limbs depends on the extent of disease and involves reconstructions of the aorto-iliac segment or infra-inguinal arterial segment or both. The first successful femoro-popliteal bypass operation was performed in 1950 by William Holden using a section of the patient's own vein; this is called autogenous vein graft (<LINK REF="REF-Holden-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holden 1950</LINK>). Since then, a number of synthetic materials have been developed, including Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a whole range of collagen tubes derived from human umbilical vein, and bovine carotid artery. Cadaveric homografts have also been used. Autogenous vein is considered the preferred conduit for infra-inguinal bypass.</P>
<P>Apart from a surgical bypass, endoluminal procedures have been developed for the treatment of PAD. Endovascular techniques for the treatment of patients with lower extremity ischaemia include balloon angioplasty, insertion of stents and stent-grafts, plaque debulking procedures, thrombolysis, and percutaneous thrombectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Tepe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tepe 2006</LINK>). The range of new adjunct or alternative endovascular treatments and techniques is consistent with the constant advent of technological developments and bioengineering.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-20 12:50:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goals of interventional treatment of chronic lower limb ischaemia are to relieve ischaemic pain, heal ischaemic ulcers, prevent limb loss, and improve patient's functional capacity and quality of life. In order to achieve these outcomes, some patients will ultimately require a surgical or endovascular revascularization procedure. Bypass procedures have the advantages of technical success, satisfactory anatomical patency and clinical durability, whereas proponents of endovascular therapies emphasise the minimally invasive nature of the procedures with subsequent reduced morbidity and mortality, enhanced recovery, and improved resource utilisation. A plethora of clinical research provides supporting evidence for the relative merits of approaches and techniques of lower limb revascularization.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:35:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aging population, the rising prevalence of diabetes in western societies, and continued tobacco abuse worldwide is likely to result in a wide spread increase of PAD and increase in the number of revascularization procedures in the foreseeable future, with resultant socioeconomic implications and consumption of health care resources. As with many surgical interventions, bypass surgery was introduced without formal evaluation. Nowadays, however, patients and doctors are expected to make informed decisions based on evidence from randomised controlled trials, and it is important that the evidence comparing surgery with other treatment modalities is readily available (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2013a</LINK>). This review summarizes all previous trials of bypass surgery and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of surgery compared with other treatments. Furthermore, it identifies areas for future research. The review provides comparisons of bypass surgery to other treatments for symptomatic PAD, but does not assess the effect of any treatment on the natural history of PAD, either claudication or CLI.</P>

<P>Analysis of dichotomous variables, such as mortality and the occurrence of postoperative complications, was carried out using the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as the summary statistic. The total numbers of participants and numbers of events for each outcome parameter were entered into RevMan 5.3 to calculate the effect measure. Patency rates were transformed into a dichotomous outcome for specific time periods. For continuous variables, such as length of hospital stay, we aimed to calculate mean differences (MDs) using means and standard deviations (SD). If different scales were used in the different studies, the results were standardised, where possible, and then combined to form a standardised mean difference (SMD). Where these data were unavailable, we reported medians and interquartile range, but did not include these results in a meta-analysis.<BR/>

They are summarized in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Approximately half of these studies (five trials) were published in 2000s; the first trial investigating the effects of bypass surgery in individuals with chronic lower limb ischaemia was published in the early 1970s (<LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 1972</LINK>). The number of participants in the included trials ranged from 12 to 452. The largest trial is the <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>, which assigned individuals with severe lower limb ischaemia secondary to infra-inguinal arterial disease to receive bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty. The eleven included trials were conducted in six different countries (seven trials in Europe and four in North America).</P>
<P>There was also some variation in the types of participant included in the eleven trials. Most trials included both men and women, except the <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Study</LINK> which involved men only. Seven trials included individuals with a range of disease severity (both IC and CLI), but two were restricted to individuals with claudication only (<LINK REF="STD-BAESIC-study" TYPE="STUDY">BAESIC study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>) and two included only those with CLI (<LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guarnera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guarnera 1994</LINK>). The proportion of claudicants in the trials with mixed groups ranged from 34% in the <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK> to 89% in the <LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK> trial. In addition, the <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK> included a mixture of individuals with native artery disease and individuals with existing grafts, but only the subset with native artery disease has been included in this review.</P>
<P>There were no trials that compared bypass surgery with a placebo, no intervention, or medical management. Six trials compared bypass surgery with PTA (<LINK REF="STD-BAESIC-study" TYPE="STUDY">BAESIC study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Study</LINK>). In the remaining trials, bypass surgery was compared with: remote endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery (<LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK>); thromboendarterectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 1972</LINK>); thrombolysis (<LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK>); spinal cord stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Guarnera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guarnera 1994</LINK>); and exercise, in which the control group performed dynamic leg exercises that were supervised by a physiotherapist (<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of bypass procedure performed in each trial was similar in most studies. Vein grafts were generally used for distal reconstructions, and synthetic prostheses for aorto-iliac or ilio-femoral bypasses and some femoro-popliteal bypasses above the knee. In the <LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK>, the type of graft for the femoro-popliteal bypass above the knee was either prosthetic (PTFE) or vein (great saphenous vein), and separate analyses were performed for the two types of graft. There was also some variation in the types of surgery performed. In four trials, unfortunately, a number of participant underwent endarterectomy rather than bypass surgery (<LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK>) and these different groups were not separated in the analysis. Furthermore, the type of endovascular procedure varied among trials comparing effects of bypass surgery with those of endovascular treatment for chronic lower limb ischaemia. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-BAESIC-study" TYPE="STUDY">BAESIC study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Study</LINK>) used PTA without stenting or with stenting at the discretion of the treating physician, whereas two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2010</LINK>) used an endograft (covered stent) in all their endovascular procedures.</P>
<P>Nine of the eleven trials included mortality and procedural (or technical) success as outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-BAESIC-study" TYPE="STUDY">BAESIC study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1991</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Study</LINK>), and most of these also reported complications, patency rates, and need for amputation. Three trials included subjective measures (<LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guarnera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guarnera 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Study</LINK>); one included only treadmill testing and measures of lower limb blood flow (<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nine ongoing trials were identified through searches of clinical trials databases. <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-2" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL 2</LINK> is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial conducted in the UK comparing the clinical and cost effectiveness of a "vein bypass first" with an "endovascular first" revascularization strategy for severe limb ischaemia due to infra-geniculate arterial disease. Best endovascular treatment involves balloon angioplasty and possibly the use of stents. Participant recruitment started in May 2014 and the anticipated end date is October 2019. The <LINK REF="STD-BEST_x002d_CLI-trial" TYPE="STUDY">BEST-CLI trial</LINK> is a pragmatic, multicentre, open label, randomised trial that compares best endovascular therapy with best open surgical treatment in individuals with CLI eligible for both treatments. This trial is funded by the National Lung Heart and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and aims to enrol 2100 participants with CLI at 120 sites in North America . Participant recruitment started in August 2014 and the anticipated end date is December 2018. <LINK REF="STD-FINNPTX" TYPE="STUDY">FINNPTX</LINK> is a Finnish multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing paclitaxel-eluting stent with femoro-popliteal bypass using PTFE graft for the treatment of long superficial femoral artery occlusion in individuals with life-limiting IC or CLI. The trial commenced in October 2011 and is estimated to be completed in 2017 with an enrolment of 400 participants. <LINK REF="STD-ROBUST" TYPE="STUDY">ROBUST</LINK> is a single-centre randomised clinical trial comparing bypass surgery with angioplasty and stenting for TASC II B and C lesions of the superficial femoral artery. It was launched in 2009 and aims to enrol 320 individuals with IC that does not respond to medical management or with CLI. <LINK REF="STD-SUPERB" TYPE="STUDY">SUPERB</LINK> is a randomised controlled trial comparing heparin-bonded endoluminal with surgical femoro-popliteal bypass in individuals with symptomatic PAD. This trial, which is currently recruiting participants in the Netherlands, commenced in October 2010 and the estimated date of completion is December 2019. The <LINK REF="STD-ZILVERPASS" TYPE="STUDY">ZILVERPASS</LINK> trial is another randomised controlled trial comparing the Cook Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent with bypass surgery for the treatment of femoro-popliteal TASC C and D lesions in individuals with symptomatic PAD. This study is being conducted in Belgium, commenced in August 2014, and is anticipated to enrol 220 participants by November 2017. The Optimized Strategy for Diabetic Patients with Critical Limb Ischaemia study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01171703" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01171703</LINK>) randomises diabetic individuals with chronic long occlusion of the superficial femoral artery to receive a femoro-popliteal PTFE bypass above the knee or stenting. Another ongoing randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN18315574" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN18315574</LINK>) compares bypass surgery with ipsilateral great saphenous vein with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement in individuals with IC or CLI and TASC C/D femoropopliteal disease. The <LINK REF="STD-NCT02580084" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02580084</LINK> trial is the only trial comparing aorto-femoral bypass with hybrid intervention consisting of common femoral endarterectomy and iliac balloon angioplasty and stenting. The study is being conducted in Russia and the estimated completion date is August 2020.</P>

<P>Inevitably, in trials of a surgical intervention, blinding was not possible, but as there were no comparison groups that received no treatment this may be less significant. None of the reports stated that those taking measurements were blinded to the treatment group and, therefore, it must be assumed that they were not. However, in several trials there was a set protocol for follow-up assessment, and objective measures for assessment of main outcomes, such as Duplex ultrasound or angiographic imaging for the assessment of patency, were used. Therefore, we judged that the outcome and the outcome measurement were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>

Furthermore, there might be a risk of bias in relation to participant compliance with exercise treatment in the <LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK> trial, but insufficient evidence that this problem would introduce bias was available. The 237 participants with native artery disease in the <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK> were a subset of a larger trial of 393 participants, which included both native artery and graft disease, and this may have biased the results. Reinterventions affecting assisted primary patency are potentially subject to intervention use bias, unless the criteria for reintervention are prespecified and applied equally to both interventions. Of the trials providing data for assisted primary patency (<LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK>), the <LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK> only defined criteria for reintervention in both groups, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK> trial did not provide specific reintervention criteria to maintain primary patency and is, therefore, subject to reintervention bias.</P>

Over three years, both groups had an average of three hospital stays. Furthermore, by three years, there was an insignificant difference in the mean length of hospital stay between the two groups, with 60 days (16 to 82 days) for the bypass group and 57 days (8 to 73 days) for the angioplasty group.

The median lengths of stay for the IC and CLI groups, respectively, were 8.6 days and 15.0 days for the surgery group, and 2.6 and 5.0 days for the angioplasty group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK> trial, the hospital stay was longer for participants assigned bypass surgery (mean 4.5 days, range 2 to 10 days) than for participants randomised to endovascular treatment (mean 1.7 days, range 0 to 7 days).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:25:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No studies comparing bypass surgery with no intervention or medical treatment were identified. In the trials selected in this review, bypass surgery was the de facto "gold standard" for the management of chronic lower extremity ischaemia of sufficient symptomatic severity to require treatment. The review provides comparisons of bypass surgery to other treatments for symptomatic PAD, but does not assess the effect of any treatment on the natural history of PAD, either claudication or CLI.</P>
<P>Comparisons of bypass surgery with angioplasty is the area in which most evidence is currently available. The main results are outlined in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Six of the eleven randomised trials reported comparisons of bypass surgery with endovascular therapy for chronic lower limb ischaemia in a total of 1015 participants (<LINK REF="STD-BAESIC-study" TYPE="STUDY">BAESIC study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepantalo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lepantalo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veterans-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans Study</LINK>). In terms of the peri-interventional outcomes, pooled analysis revealed that bypass surgery was associated with greater technical success than PTA. However, when interpreting this finding, one should take into account that technical success was either inconsistently defined among the trials included in the meta-analysis or not defined at all. Furthermore, it was not possible to assess haemodynamic parameters as a measure of technical success, and no distinction was made between procedural success measures, such as improved blood flow to the foot and increased ankle brachial index (ABI), and technical success of merely accomplishing the intended intervention. Even though a trend towards reduced early postinterventional non-thrombotic complications and procedural mortality in the endovascular treatment group was demonstrated, such differences did not reach statistical significance. Regarding the follow-up outcomes, an interesting finding of our analysis is that the primary patency rate at one year was higher after bypass surgery, but no difference was found at four years of follow up. Furthermore, the assisted primary patency was higher in the bypass group, but this finding should be cautiously interpreted in the presence of a wide CI. One should also take into account that primary patency is a measure of the effectiveness of the procedure itself, while assisted primary patency is a function of the postprocedure surveillance process and willingness to intervene and is, therefore, subject to surveillance, observer and intervention bias. Modern objective performance comparisons consider the number and types of interventions needed to maintain patency, but data on this were not available. No differences were identified in the rest of the clinical outcome parameters for which data were available for meta-analyses, including clinical improvement, amputation and reintervention rates, and late mortality. Similar results were found when subgroup analyses, comprising of participants with similar clinical severity of disease and anatomical level of reconstruction, were performed, except that bypass surgery was associated with a higher early non-thrombotic complication rate compared with angioplasty in participants with CLI but not in those with claudication. No difference in subjective outcome parameters, indicated by quality of life and physical and psychosocial well-being, was reported. The hospital stay for the index procedure was reported to be longer in participants undergoing bypass surgery than those treated with angioplasty. It is unknown, however, why participants undergoing bypass surgery stayed in the hospital for a longer period, and whether there were more minor amputations, debridement of pedal wounds or gangrene in one group versus the other, or the difference was entirely due to recovery from the index revascularization procedure itself.</P>
<P>Limited literature information was identified regarding comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatment modalities for chronic lower limb ischaemia. The recent <LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK> compared outcomes of bypass surgery and remote endarterectomy for femoro-popliteal arterial disease. In this trial cohort of 116 patients, femoro-popliteal bypass above the knee demonstrated similar outcomes with remote endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery, expressed by technical success, perioperative morbidity and mortality, vessel or graft patency, progression to amputation, and late mortality.</P>
<P>The only clinical trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness of bypass surgery and thrombolysis for the treatment of chronic lower limb ischaemia is the <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK>. The results of this trial suggest some benefit of surgery compared with thrombolysis; the amputation rate was lower in the bypass group, particularly in patients with CLI and femoro-popliteal lesions. Furthermore, the frequency of ongoing or recurrent ischaemia was lower after bypass surgery than after thrombolysis. There were no differences in the mortality rate or complications of the intervention between the two groups.</P>
<P>One trial only compared bypass surgery with thromboendarterectomy in a total of 43 participants with chronic limb ischaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 1972</LINK>). Despite the small size of the trial, a difference in restoration of blood flow and blood loss in favour of bypass surgery was found. Mortality and amputation rates did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Unfortunately, information on the rest of the clinical outcome parameters was not provided.</P>
<P>Surgery was compared with exercise in a small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>), and these results may, therefore, also have limited relevance. The only clear statistically significant difference was in the ABI, which was higher in the surgery group following intervention.</P>
<P>Bypass was compared with spinal cord stimulation in one trial of only 12 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Guarnera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guarnera 1994</LINK>). No differences were reported between the two interventions. Due to the small sample size of the study, analyses produced very wide CIs, so the finding of no difference should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:25:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our search of bibliographic databases identified limited clinical research validating bypass surgery for the treatment of chronic lower limb ischaemia. The eleven trials included in this review varied in size, quality, and in the intervention served as control. There were no trials in which bypass surgery was compared with a placebo or no intervention, undoubtedly for ethical reasons. Furthermore, no trials comparing surgery with medical treatment were identified. Most existing evidence provides comparative information about bypass surgery versus endovascular treatment for chronic lower limb ischaemia (six trials). For the comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatment modalities, the evidence is limited, being provided by only one trial in each comparison. Most trials reported important outcome parameters, such as mortality, morbidity, patency and amputation rates, but other clinical information, such as walking distance in claudicants and ulcer healing in patients with CLI, was inadequately reported. Furthermore, amputation free survival and major adverse limb events, which are important outcomes and part of modern recommendations for studies of comparative effectiveness, were not reported in the studies included in review. Similarly, limited information was provided regarding subjective measures, such as quality of life and resource utilization.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the existing results of bypass surgery versus PTA do not provide an overall clear picture favouring one treatment over the other. This may be because the existing trials were too small, because the effects really are similar, or because differences will appear only in defined subgroups of patients. It must also be remembered that these trials include only a small subset of patients with lower limb ischaemia, as those patients with multilevel disease requiring extensive or hybrid surgical and endovascular arterial reconstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2009</LINK>) or those requiring tibial or pedal artery bypass may not be eligible for angioplasty. Extrapolation of our findings to the entire population suffering from PAD should be judiciously performed, because a great proportion of patients presenting with chronic lower limb ischaemia may be unsuitable for intervention due to the presence of comorbid conditions and, therefore, treated conservatively. Furthermore, these trials only included patients deemed suitable for either surgery or PTA. Patients with extensive lesions could have been excluded from receiving angioplasty and, therefore, participating in the trial. It is possible that these patients with more severe lesions receive more benefits from a surgical approach. This remains to be investigated. The long-term (&lt; 5 years) effects or bypass surgery in comparison to endovascular therapy remain unknown. The <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK> found that for those patients who survived for at least two years after randomisation, a bypass-first revascularization strategy was associated with a significant increase in overall survival and a trend towards improved amputation-free survival compared to a balloon angioplasty-first revascularization strategy. The trials also did not give detailed descriptions of how the angioplasties were performed and whether stents were used as an adjunct. A systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of primary stenting as opposed to balloon angioplasty alone, mainly for long lesions, as a first-line endovascular treatment for symptomatic disease in the femoro-popliteal segment (<LINK REF="REF-Acin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acin 2012</LINK>). None of the trials mentioned subintimal angioplasty, which may have produced different results (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2013</LINK>). Lastly, balloon angioplasty and stent technology is constantly evolving. Application of modern endovascular therapies, such as drug-eluting balloons and stents and bioabsorbable stents for the treatment of anatomically "difficult" lesions, may reveal subtle differences in outcomes between treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2014</LINK>). Furthermore, the introduction of endovascular tools, such as atherectomy, chronic total occlusion and re-entry devices, may play an important role in improving procedural success and limb salvage.</P>
<P>All the evidence comparing bypass surgery with thrombolysis came from the <LINK REF="STD-STILE-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">STILE Trial</LINK>. This was a large high quality trial, but was included in the review with some reservations (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). Some of these problems were mitigated by the randomisation method, which ensured that those with native artery disease were balanced across the interventions, and by the analysis, which was performed after excluding those patients with acute ischaemia. The third problem, relating to the use of endarterectomy in 14% of the surgery group, could not be addressed.</P>
<P>The rest of the trials comparing bypass surgery with remote endarterectomy (<LINK REF="STD-REVAS-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">REVAS Trial</LINK>), thromboendarterectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 1972</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>), and spinal cord stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Guarnera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guarnera 1994</LINK>) were relatively small, with a short follow-up period; therefore, the results must be viewed with caution. Lack of statistical significance may result from the small sample size and not from any true absence of difference. The trials <LINK REF="STD-Gaspard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspard 1972</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Guarnera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guarnera 1994</LINK> are old studies, involving extensive aorto-iliac endarterectomy and spinal cord stimulation, respectively, procedures which are currently rarely used in clinical practice.</P>

<P>The majority of the evidence investigating effects of bypass surgery for chronic lower limb ischaemia derives from randomised trials of surgical versus endovascular treatment for PAD affecting the lower limbs. Six such trials were identified, reporting a total of 1015 participants. Most of these studies had an adequate design and were executed well. No significant methodological constraints were identified. The available information is limited, however, by the fact that most of these studies recruited patients with a wide range of disease severity and/or anatomical location and extent of disease. According to current guidelines, the extent of atherosclerotic disease has a great impact on decision making and the selection of type of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Norgren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgren 2007</LINK>). We attempted to circumvent such limitations by performing subgroup analyses, but the numbers of participants included in such analyses were relatively small. Furthermore, the type of endovascular treatment varied among studies, ranging from balloon angioplasty with bare stent placement at the discretion of the treating physician to routine use of covered stents. Despite the heterogenous nature of study populations and treatments, the trials consistently reported no great differences in main outcomes between surgical and endovascular treatment of chronic lower limb ischaemia. No solid conclusions can be drawn regarding comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatments because of the paucity of available evidence; only one study for each comparison was identified. When assessing bypass surgery versus PTA, we judged the quality of the evidence to be high for all primary outcomes except for clinical improvement and primary patency. We judged the quality of the evidence for clinical improvement to be low due to due to heterogeneity between the studies and the fact this was a subjective outcome assessment and therefore at risk of detection bias. We judged the quality of the evidence for primary patency moderate due to heterogeneity between the studies. Furthermore, the CI for this outcome and for several outcomes in the comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatments was large, which might be due to either a lack of studies, small participant numbers, or low number of events for some of the outcomes. For the comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatment modalities, the evidence is also limited by being provided by only one trial in each comparison.</P>

<P>A related systematic review and meta-analysis of surgical versus endovascular reconstruction of femoro-popliteal arterial disease was recently conducted by our evidence synthesis research group (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2013b</LINK>). This review identified four randomised trials and six observational studies comprising a total of 2817 patients. Pooled analysis revealed that endovascular treatment was accompanied by lower 30-day morbidity (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.41) and higher technical failure than bypass surgery (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22). Similar to the results of the present review, analyses of follow-up outcomes demonstrated higher primary patency rates in the surgical treatment arm one (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.28), two (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.45), and three years following intervention (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.97), with this difference favouring surgery disappearing at four years (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.60). Limb loss rates within two and three years of intervention was found to be higher in the endovascular group; however, at the end of the fourth year, the benefit in limb salvage in favour bypass surgery was eliminated. The study concluded that an endovascular-first approach may be advisable in patients with significant comorbidity, whereas for fit patients with a longer-term perspective, a bypass procedure may be offered as a first line interventional treatment.</P>
<P>A systematic review of nine studies (3071 subjects) investigating the comparative effectiveness of bypass surgery versus endovascular treatment for severe or CLI found no difference in mortality (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.16) or amputation (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.65), but higher primary patency (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.99) and assisted primary patency (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.51) (<LINK REF="REF-Abu-Dabrh-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu Dabrh 2016</LINK>). Another recent meta-analysis found that angioplasty was not inferior to bypass surgery in patients with CLI, as indicated by amputation-free survival, revascularisation, leg amputation, and overall mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Fu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fu 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>No systematic reviews and analyses of bypass surgery versus other treatment modalities for chronic lower limb ischaemia were identified. A systematic review of the literature undertaken by our research group (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2008</LINK>) demonstrated that remote endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery had acceptable outcomes, as indicated by technical success, procedure-related complications, and patency rates. However, it was limited by the fact that it included single-arm observational studies only and no comparisons with other therapeutic modalities, such as bypass surgery, were performed, as no related information was available. A recent systematic review in patients with acute lower limb ischaemia (&lt; 14 days) found that thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications, including stroke, than surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Berridge-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berridge 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of bypass surgery is limited and, therefore, in many comparisons, no clear implications for practice can be drawn. Our analysis has shown that angioplasty is associated with decreased peri-interventional complications, especially in patients with CLI, and shorter hospital stays compared with bypass surgery. Surgical treatment, on the other hand, seems to confer improved patency rates within a year of treatment, whereas comparative long-term effects (&gt; 5 years) of bypass surgery and endoluminal therapy are unknown. Interestingly, the <LINK REF="STD-BASIL-study" TYPE="STUDY">BASIL study</LINK> found that for those participants who survived for at least two years after randomisation, a bypass-first revascularization strategy was associated with a significant increase in overall survival compared to a balloon angioplasty-first revascularization strategy. In view of these findings, endovascular treatment may be advisable in patients with significant co-morbid conditions, rendering them high risk surgical candidates, whereas bypass surgery may be preferred for young and fit patients. No solid conclusions can be drawn regarding comparisons of bypass surgery with other treatments because of the presence of one study only in each comparison. The available evidence is limited by wide CIs for several outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:25:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the challenges for the vascular specialist is to identify which treatment is most appropriate for which patient, and this question should be addressed in future research. Trials should be large enough to ensure that any impact of potentially important factors (e.g. site and extent of disease, symptoms, and risk factor status) on outcome can be determined in the analysis. These features should, therefore, be balanced at randomisation to prevent bias. One of the limitations of published research is that whilst most arterial lesions can be treated by surgery, there is no agreement on what is suitable for angioplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Bradbury-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbury 2004</LINK>). This limits the validity of trials' results, as individual centres' suitability may differ substantially from that of trials'. The same problem affects future research. Large, pragmatic, scientifically robust randomised trials investigating long-term (&gt; 5 years) outcomes are needed to elucidate therapeutic dilemmas in the management of the patient with severe limb ischaemia and produce the answers needed to make nation-wide decisions about the most appropriate treatment in specific patient categories. Furthermore, technological achievements and the constantly evolving endovascular techniques, such as drug-eluting balloons and stents and bioabsorbable stents, should be incorporated in clinical research and their efficacy assessed in clinical trials. Best medical therapy accompanied by exercise regimens has not been adequately evaluated in patients presenting with claudication. Assessment of quality of life is also of prime importance in patients with chronic lower limb ischaemia. Utilization of resources, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness of interventional treatments for chronic lower limb ischaemia also constitute areas of future research.</P>
