<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>MS is a chronic disease of the nervous system affecting young and middle-aged adults. MS is supposed to be related to the immune system. CFX is an immunosuppressive drug used for various autoimmune diseases. As its use for MS is controversial, the Authors of this review aimed to assess CFX efficacy for patients with progressive MS. Among the pertinent literature, only five studies met the inclusion criteria of minimum methodological quality , with a total of 90 MS patients treated with CFX.<BR/>The data available were inadequate to attain all the objectives specified for the review. The Authors found poor evidence that CFX may slow progression in the medium-term. They found also that side effects such as alopecia, nausea, vomiting and menses interruption (amenorrhea) occurred at high frequency, while some evidences might suggest adverse effects also after two years .<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis is a presumed cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Cyclophosphamide (CFX) is a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agent, used in systemic autoimmune diseases. Controversial results have been reported on its efficacy in MS. We conducted a systematic review of all relevant trials, evaluating the efficacy of CFX in patients with progressive MS.</P>

<P>Of the 461 identified references, we initially selected 70: only four RCTs were included for the final analysis. Intensive immunosuppression with CFX (alone or associated with ACTH or prednisone) in patients with progressive MS compared to placebo or no treatment (152 participants) did not prevent the long-term (12, 18, 24 months) clinical disability progression as defined as evolution to a next step of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. However, the mean change in disability (final disability subtracted from the baseline) significantly favoured the treated group at 12 (effect size - 0.21, 95% confidence interval - 0.25 to -0.17) and 18 months (- 0.19, 95% confidence interval - 0.24 to - 0.14) but favoured the control group at 24 months (0.14, CI 0.07 to 0.21). We were unable to verify the efficacy of other schedules. Five patients died; sepsis and amenorrhea frequently occurred in treated patients (descriptive analysis).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We were unable to achieve all of the objectives specified for the review. This review shows that the overall effect of CFX (administered as intensive schedule) in the treatment of progressive MS does not support its use in clinical practice.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-18 10:40:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an autoimmune disease associated with immune activity against central nervous system antigens. Immunosuppression and immuno-modulation are the mainstays of the therapeutic strategies for this disease. Cyclophosphamide (CFX) is an alkylant agent with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive effects (<LINK REF="REF-Calabresi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calabresi 1991</LINK>), used in the treatment of different malignancies as well as autoimmune diseases (Wegener's granulomatosis, Periarteritis nodosa, Lupus Erythematosus Systemic) (<LINK REF="REF-Boumpas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boumpas 1992</LINK>). It has also been reported to reduce the severity and prevent Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis, the animal model of MS (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson--1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 1974</LINK>).<BR/>The efficacy of CFX in patients with progressive or relapsing form of MS remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Schluep-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schluep 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2002</LINK>). Different treatment schedules have been adopted: varying dosages, route of administration (i.e. oral, intravenous), duration (ranging from a few days to months) and association with other drugs (i.e. adrenocorticotropic hormone-ACTH-steroids or other immunosuppressive agents) or with plasma exchange, followed or not by pulse maintenance treatment. The side effects and potential long-term toxicity have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-DeRidder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeRidder 1998</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Fraiser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraiser 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Talar_x002d_Williams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talar-Williams 1996</LINK>). <BR/>In order to evaluate the existing data on CFX efficacy for patients with progressive MS, we have undertaken a systematic review of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on this subject.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objectives of this review were to assess:<BR/>(1) whether the CFX treatment in MS patients slows disease progression; <BR/>(2) whether the effect of CFX is modified by the addition of steroids or ACTH.</P>
<P>The secondary objectives were to assess:<BR/>(1) whether CFX treatment prevent clinical relapses in secondary progressive (SP) MS;<BR/>(2) whether treatment efficacy is related to clinical variables (such as primary versus SP course; disease duration; and duration of progressive phase); <BR/>(3) the safety and tolerability of the treatment.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All RCTs evaluating the clinical effect of CFX treatment in MS patients. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients affected by clinical definite MS, according to specific criteria (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>) who are in the progressive phase (primary and secondary), according to Lublin's criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Lublin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lublin 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included RCTs evaluating the following treatment schedules.<BR/>(1) CFX administered alone or in combination with steroids or ACTH (the use of other immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents and plasma-exchange was excluded).<BR/>(2) Accepted CFX treatment schedules.<BR/>(a) Intensive immunosuppression schedule or "induction phase" (high dose in few days).<BR/>(b) Prolonged immunosuppression (fractionated doses in months).<BR/>(c) Pulse therapy (boluses of high doses for one day serially administered over time). <BR/>An arbitrary cut-off was considered for high versus low doses, since, to the best of our knowledge, no clear indication has been suggested.<BR/>(3) Comparison group using placebo, no treatment, or the same co-intervention (ACTH or steroids) only.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main outcome criterion was clinical disability progression, defined as an increase of 0.5 point of disability (according to the Kurtzke disability scale - <LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>) for patients with baseline EDSS greater than or equal to 6.0 and 1 point of disability for basal EDSS less than or equal to 5.5, sustained for three months. However, in order to allow comparisons among trials other less stringent criteria were accepted, such as an increase of 0.5 to 1 point, irrespective of basal EDSS, confirmed or not.<BR/>From each treatment group, the following outcome measures have been extracted:<BR/>(1) number of worsened patients;<BR/>(2) number of patients stable or improved (decrease of 0.5 to 1 point from baseline EDSS value); <BR/>(3) differences of disability between treatment versus control groups, evaluated as differences in progression of disability , defined as differences between the mean change of disability (EDSS final less EDSS onset) between treatment and control groups;<BR/>(4) relapse rate and time to exacerbation in secondary progressive patients with superimposed relapses;<BR/>(5) number of patients with side effects (laboratory hematological abnormalities, urotoxicity, infectious diseases). Both major (requiring or prolonging the hospitalization) and minor side effects have been considered.<BR/>The first four outcome measures have been evaluated at different points in time, according to treatment duration of the studies and follow up, while the fifth outcome was reported as frequency during the follow-up.<BR/>The outcomes have been considered separately for primary and secondary progressive MS, if reported.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (LLM and NM) independently decided whether to include or exclude each identified study; independently extracted and summarized data using an ad hoc form and cross-checked the extracted data. Any discrepancy has been resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (BWG).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>We extracted the following data from each study: <BR/>(1) exclusion/inclusion criteria;<BR/>(2) number of patients analysed in each group;<BR/>(3) key baseline variables of each group at entry;<BR/>(4) primary and secondary outcome measures;<BR/>(5) description of treatment schedules (dose and timing of drug administration);<BR/>(6) duration of follow-up in each group;<BR/>(7) number of patients excluded and lost to follow-up in each group; and<BR/>(8) side effects (type and incidence in each treatment group).<BR/>We contacted authors for their original data to allow comparisons among studies according to the predefined outcome measures. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Quality assessment <BR/>
</B>We assessed trial quality by: <BR/>(1) method of randomization;<BR/>(2) blinding of patients, clinicians and outcome assessors;<BR/>(3) the reporting of withdrawals and drop outs;<BR/>(4) intention-to-treat analysis;<BR/>(5) evidence of a priori sample size calculation;<BR/>(6) adoption of specific criteria of diagnosis;<BR/>(7) adoption of specific criteria of outcome measures.<BR/>Two reviewers ( LLM, NM) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies, using the Jadad checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The scale's score ranges from zero (lowest possible score) to five (highest possible score), with two points for randomisation (defined/not defined = 2/1)and blinding (Double/single = 2/1) and one point if drop outs were less than 15%. Studies scoring less than three points were regarded as being of low methodological quality. </P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B> <BR/>We entered data into Cochrane Review Manager software and analysed it using Cochrane MetaView. Results are presented with 95% confidence intervals. We reported summary statistics for dichotomous outcomes as relative risk, and for continuous outcomes as weighted mean differences. We pooled estimates using a fixed effect model and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the chi squared test. We also considered sensitivity analysis evaluating the quality of studies methodology (i.e. adoption of blindness, specific criteria of diagnosis and outcome) which might affect the overall results.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Of the 461 identified references (from January 1966 to June 2006), we selected 70 potentially relevant studies. Of those, 54 were rejected, primarily because of study design limitations (i.e. not controlled or randomised or preliminary studies). Of the 16 remaining RCTs, another eleven were excluded because the type of participants or the treatment schedules did not correspond to the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Andrea-1991" TYPE="STUDY">D'Andrea 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khatri-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Khatri 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killian-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Killian 1988</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK> as preliminary results and its final report <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>) , one was another publication relevant to Weiner 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1990</LINK>) and one was a comparative randomised trial including a third group, which was not treated and not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1987</LINK>). The protocol of another RCT has been reported ( <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2004</LINK>), but the final study has been not published yet (see "Table of excluded studies"). Five studies were included: two, evaluating CFX efficacy versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Likosky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Likosky 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK>), were used for the main analysis; three "comparative trials" (<LINK REF="STD-Hauser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wender-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wender 1988</LINK> and its extension <LINK REF="REF-Wender-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wender 1989</LINK>) were analysed separately to evaluate the efficacy of ACTH co-intervention (see "Table of included studies"). All of the included trials have randomised progressive patients with or without superimposed relapses (without clear distinction between secondary or primary progressive MS) (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). All evaluated the efficacy of CFX administered as an "intensive/induction" regimen, either alone (<LINK REF="STD-Likosky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Likosky 1991</LINK>) or associated or ACTH (<LINK REF="STD-Hauser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauser 1983</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Wender-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wender 1988</LINK>) or prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK> included a third arm, evaluating a different regimen as add on PE, this arm was excluded from the main analysis, in order to achieve better homogeneity. Finally, because the studies accepted for analysis adopted different definitions of treatment failure (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), the individual EDSS values at each time point were necessary for analysis. The EDSS data were reported in the full paper of <LINK REF="STD-Likosky-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Likosky 1991</LINK>. We contacted Noseworthy for original data, (<LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK>) which were promptly received and submitted for inclusion in the proposed meta-analysis. According to the predefined outcome criteria, we were able to analyse the results at three time points: 12, 18 and 24 months. The studies comparing the efficacy of CFX plus ACTH versus ACTH alone were considered in a separate sub-analysis: the available data allowed only one comparison (number of patients worsened of at least one EDSS point, at 12 months).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The assessment of trials quality is reported in the additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.

The method of blinding was described in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK>) in which, despite its description as double-blind, most of the patients correctly identified the assigned therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>). The method of randomisation was specified in another study (<LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK>). All the included studies adopted definite criteria of MS diagnosis and outcome measures (treatment failure). The definition of the type of MS in terms of Chronic Progressive (CP) and Secondary Progressive (SP) was unclear; it was reported as baseline data for two studies(<LINK REF="STD-The-CCMSSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">The CCMSSG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wender-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wender 1988</LINK>) but not considered further in the analysis.

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We were able to partially achieve the objectives outlined for this review . The available data enabled us to verify the efficacy of only one treatment schedule (intensive immunosuppression). According to the main outcome criteria (clinical disability progression) no effect was detected. Intensive immunosuppression with CFX (alone or associated with prednisone) in patients with progressive MS compared to placebo (152 participants) does not prevent the long-term risk to clinical disability progression, as defined by the evolution to a next step of disability score (that is worsening of 0.5/1 EDSS points, according to baseline EDSS): at 12 months relative risk (RR) 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.40); at 18 months RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.24); at 24 months RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.39) (see "Table of comparisons "01.CFX versus placebo. No. worsened"). We found no differences in the number of improved or stable patients; at 18 months only, the RR approximates the significance value (p= 0.09). However, the differences of the mean change of disability (final disability subtracted from the baseline) significantly favored the treatment group at 12 months (weighted mean difference (WMD) - 0.21; 95% CI - 0.25 to - 0.17) and 18 months (WMD - 0.19; 95% CI - 0.24 to - 0.14). At 24 months the increase of progression of disability was significantly worse in the CFX treated group (WMD +0.14; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.21) (see "Table of comparisons "01.CFX versus placebo; EDSS change"). It was not possible to determine the effect on the relapse rate in secondary progressive MS, due to the lack of data. </P>
<P>We performed a sub-analysis to evaluate the benefit of ACTH co-intervention, but the results must be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the studies (p = 0.0082) and the type of comparison (number of worsened patients at 12 months), (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.67) (see "Table of comparisons "02. CFX+ACTH versus ACTH").</P>
<P>The side effects are showed in additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>: only descriptive analysis was possible. Among the 90 CFX-treated participants, the following main side effects were reported: alopecia, occurring in 100%, nausea and vomiting in 55 to 71%; amenorrhea in 42% (24% permanent) and cystitis in 4% of the cases. Major infections, like sepsis, or bronchopneumonia were reported in 11% of the participants. It should be mentioned that CFX was administered with particular procedures to reduce urotoxicity (hydration and sometimes catheterization) and nausea and vomiting (anti-emetic drugs). CFX therapy also was reported to induce leukopenia: decrease of white blood cells (lowest 774), occurred five to seven days after the last dose, and began to recover seven days later. Five patients died: one related to MS at 18, one with lung cancer at 20, one with myocardial infarction at 15, one with bronchopneumonia at six months from onset of therapy, and one placebo treated for liver disease.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-25 12:03:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Our systematic review, planned to evaluate the benefit of CFX therapy in patients with progressive MS, was only able to answer to a limited extent the a priori defined aims. The difficulties that we encountered were mostly related to the small number of CFX RCTs available (only four met the inclusion criteria), and to the heterogeneity of treatment regimens and study conducts. Although all the studies used the universally accepted Kurtzke EDSS disability scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>), the outcome criteria (treatment failure) were differently defined . We were able to obtain raw data from the original studies, and so we were able to overcome these limitations by adopting a common outcome criterion of disease progression (defined as an increase of 0.5 point of disability for patients with baseline EDSS &#8805; 6 and 1 point for EDSS &#8804; 5.5 and the mean change of disability), pertinent for the kind of MS patients included in the studies. In this way, we were able to satisfy only the first main objective (whether the CFX treatment in MS patients slows disease progression) for only one treatment schedule (Induction).</P>
<P>The results indicated that CFX treatment did not prevent the evolution of disease to a higher EDSS status. The increase of disability (EDSS mean change) was significantly lower in the medium term in treated patients. This effect may be worthwhile for a short-term therapy (such as a few days) in disabled MS patients However, this outcome is less sensitive and is based not on continuous score, which changes in multiples of 0.5. A significant increase of disability was found at 24 months, probably due further deterioration of the disease .</P>
<P>The lack of data unable us to verify the efficacy of other treatment schedules (such as boluses) and whether treatment efficacy is related to clinical variables, such as the form of disease (secondary versus primary progressive) or disease duration. The safety of the analysed schedule (intensive immunosuppression) was poor.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-25 12:05:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This meta-analysis did not allow definite conclusions on the efficacy of CFX therapy in MS patients, due to limited available data, poor quality of the studies, and the use of obsolete outcome criteria. The available data did not allow us to verify the efficacy of different schedules, in different form of the disease and in patients with different clinical characteristics (disability, disease duration, progression duration). The overall results show that CFX administered on an intensive schedule (the only analysed schedule) in disabled progressive patients has a clinical effect and safety profile that do not justify its use in clinical practice. </P>

<P>CFX has been used in MS therapy since 1966 (<LINK REF="STD-Aimard-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Aimard 1966</LINK>), and continue to be administered (<LINK REF="STD-Gauthier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gauthier 2003</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Gobbini-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gobbini 1999</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perini 2003</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zefir-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zefir 2003</LINK>), confirming the results of the international questionnaire on the clinical practice of immunosuppression treatments in MS (<LINK REF="REF-Hommes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hommes 2004</LINK> ). The low number of well-conducted studies underlines the difficulty of properly evaluating the efficacy of CFX therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2002</LINK>) in patients with progressive form of the disease. This review shows that detailed and clear information on clinical characteristics of patients, on MS form (either secondary or primary progressive) are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of MS therapies, as well as blinding evaluation of treatment response (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>'). A correct evaluation of treatment safety required a clear description of side-effects. A systematic long -term surveillance of treated patients should be provided, because of the risk of potential toxicity, including cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Talar_x002d_Williams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talar-Williams 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-DeRidder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeRidder 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fraiser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraiser 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 1991</LINK>).<BR/>The use of secondary outcome measures, including upper limb function and cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Rudick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudick 2002</LINK>), patient perception (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>) and paraclinical surrogate measures (MRI), as well as blinding evaluation of treatment response ( <LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>) are recommended for the adequate assessment of therapeutic effect.<BR/>It should be underlined that the included studies have been performed more than ten years ago. However, the use of CFX in the recent years presents two main differences in respect to the past, in both pharmacological and clinical aspects. High dose CFX (intensive induction schedule) is limited to patients undergoing stem cell transplantation ( <LINK REF="REF-Mc-Guire-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mc Guire 2003</LINK>) , while at present the most commonly used regimen is every 4 to 8-week pulse therapy given with or without corticosteroids, whose safety and tolerability have been recently reported (<LINK REF="STD-Portaccio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Portaccio 2003</LINK>). Most of the treated patients are affected by rapidly deteriorating SP MS ( <LINK REF="STD-Perini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zefir-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zefir 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Perini 2006</LINK> ) or RR refractory MS (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reggio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reggio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gladstone-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gladstone 2006</LINK>), excluding those in the later stages of the disease, when probably irreversible degenerative damage predominates over inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2002</LINK>). Predictive factors of response have been identified, such as short progression duration (<LINK REF="STD-Delmont-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Delmont 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zephir-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zephir 2004</LINK>); furthermore MRI data confirming the clinical response are reported (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2004-a" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2004 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gladstone-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gladstone 2006</LINK>). However, none of these last studies fits the inclusion criteria of our analysis, preventing a critical analysis of these points.<BR/>
