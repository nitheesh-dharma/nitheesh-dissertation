<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-19 12:57:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malignant otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external auditory canal. This condition was originally described by Chandler in 1968 (<LINK REF="REF-Chandler-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 1968</LINK>) and is also known as necrotising external otitis (<LINK REF="REF-Kraus-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraus 1988</LINK>). Diagnosis is made upon clinical, microbiological and radiological grounds. For the purpose of this review, we define malignant otitis externa broadly as "a necrotising infection of the external ear canal including surrounding soft tissue and bone" (<LINK REF="REF-Hickham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickham 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with this condition are typically elderly, diabetic men but other groups have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Giamarellou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giamarellou 1992</LINK>). The precise aetiology of this condition is unknown, but theories related to altered host immunity, local tissue microangiopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Doroghazi-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doroghazi 1981</LINK>) and even altered cerumen biochemistry (<LINK REF="REF-Driscoll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driscoll 1993</LINK>) have been proposed. The disease originates in the external auditory canal and spreads through the osteocartilaginous junction to involve the soft tissues beneath the temporal bone. Initially osteomyelitis of the skull base ensues, followed by involvement of the facial and other cranial nerves. Malignant otitis externa is also complicated by parotitis, mastoiditis, jugular vein thrombosis, meningitis and death (<LINK REF="REF-Giamarellou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giamarellou 1992</LINK>). Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and is suspected in any diabetic or immunocompromised patient with pseudomonal otitis externa, especially when pain is a prominent feature. Technicium bone scanning has been described as the single most useful diagnostic tool (<LINK REF="REF-Parisier-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parisier 1982</LINK>), but other forms of radiological imaging play a role in indicating disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Hickham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickham 1996</LINK>). The mortality for this condition has been reported to be as high as one-third (<LINK REF="REF-Chandler-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 1972</LINK>), but when cranial nerves are affected it may be as high as 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Aldous-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldous 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally the mainstay of treatment for malignant otitis externa has been prolonged antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1982</LINK>), stringent diabetes control (<LINK REF="REF-Resouly-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resouly 1982</LINK>), repeated debridement of necrotic tissue and sometimes aggressive surgical management (<LINK REF="REF-Reines-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reines 1980</LINK>). Hyperbaric oxygen is gradually gaining acceptance as a beneficial adjunctive therapy and has been recommended whenever a therapeutic pressure chamber is available (<LINK REF="REF-Shupak-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 1989</LINK>). There are 24 centres offering such facilities in the United Kingdom. Hyperbaric oxygen is available for and currently being used in the treatment of many other medical conditions. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is the administration of 100% oxygen for respiration at pressures above 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Hyperbaric oxygen treatment involves placing the patient in a compression chamber, increasing the environmental pressure within the chamber and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 2 and 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or twice daily. A typical course might involve 15 to 30 such treatments (<LINK REF="REF-HMP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">HMP 1994</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, 30 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen would typically cost GBP 3000, i.e. GBP 100 per session or GBP 50 per hour (<LINK REF="REF-Laden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laden 2005</LINK>). Complications and side effects of hyperbaric oxygen treatment include barotraumas to the ear, round window blowout, 'sinus squeeze', visual refractive changes, numb fingers, dental problems, claustrophobia, seizures and pulmonary oxygen toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-HMP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">HMP 1994</LINK>). In general these effects are either very rare or are only temporary. It is postulated that hyperbaric oxygen treatment works by elevating the oxygen partial pressure from hypoxia to normal or above normal levels, which amplifies the oxygen diffusion gradient into the avascular tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Mader-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mader 1980</LINK>). This is a prerequisite for efficient leukocyte function (<LINK REF="REF-Hohn-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohn 1976</LINK>) and has been shown to promote fibroblastic division, collagen production and capillary angiogenesis, thus enhancing soft tissue and bone healing (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>Malignant otitis externa is an uncommon condition associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Shupak-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 1989</LINK>). It is important to construct a systematic review to define the role of hyperbaric oxygen fully in the treatment of this condition.</P>

<P>No randomised controlled trials were identified by our search strategy. The quality of the data identified was therefore not adequate to allow further discussion. We will, however, briefly describe the types of studies identified by our search strategy.</P>
<P>We found four case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mader-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mader 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shupak-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 1989</LINK>) and five case series (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucente-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucente 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucente-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucente 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tisch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tisch 2003</LINK>), which included a total of 73 patients. These articles described the use of hyperbaric oxygen as adjuvant therapy with antibiotics in the majority of cases. In general, most regimens used 20 to 40 doses of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Each treatment was of 90 minutes duration at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Alternative regimens differed very little. There was no mention of any complications related to hyperbaric oxygen treatment.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>

<P>Our findings demonstrate the need for a well-designed, randomised controlled trial to compare hyperbaric oxygen therapy with standard therapy. Any future trials would need to consider in particular the following.</P>
