<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:57:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Acute renal colic is the pain caused by the blockage of urine flow secondary to urinary stones. The prevalence of kidney stone is thought to be between 2% to 3%, and the incidence has been increasing in recent years due to changes in diet and lifestyle. The renal colic pain is usually a sudden intense pain located in the flank or abdominal areas. This usually happens when a urinary stone blocks the ureter (the tube connecting the kidneys to the bladder). Different types of pain killers are used to ease the discomfort. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antispasmodics (treatment that suppresses muscle spasms) are used commonly to relieve pain and discomfort. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of commonly used non-opioid pain killers in adult patients with acute renal colic pain. Fifty studies enrolling 5734 participants were included in this review. Treatments varied greatly and combining of studies was difficult. We found that overall NSAIDs were more effective than other non-opioid pain killers including antispasmodics for pain reduction and need for additional medication. We also found that the combining NSAIDs with antispasmodics did not increase the efficacy. No serious adverse effects were reported by any of the included studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-25 11:40:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Renal colic is acute pain caused by urinary stones. The prevalence of urinary stones is between 10% and 15% in the United States, making renal colic one of the common reasons for urgent urological care. The pain is usually severe and the first step in the management is adequate analgesia. Many different classes of medications have been used in this regard including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:57:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The aim of this review was to assess benefits and harms of different NSAIDs and non-opioids in the treatment of adult patients with acute renal colic and if possible to determine which medication (or class of medications) are more appropriate for this purpose. Clinically relevant outcomes such as efficacy of pain relief, time to pain relief, recurrence of pain, need for rescue medication and side effects were explored.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-27 15:17:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Y Higgins">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 27 November 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-26 13:15:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Only randomised or quasi randomised studies were included. Other inclusion criteria included adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of renal colic due to urolithiasis, at least one treatment arm included a non-narcotic analgesic compared to placebo or another non-narcotic drug, and reporting of pain outcome or medication adverse effect. Patient-rated pain by a validated tool, time to relief, need for rescue medication and pain recurrence constituted the outcomes of interest. Any adverse effects (minor or major) reported in the studies were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-26 12:25:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Abstracts were reviewed by at least two authors independently. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria were fully reviewed and relevant data were recorded in a standardized Cochrane Renal Group data collection form. For dichotomous outcomes relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference was estimated. Both fixed and random models were used for meta-analysis. We assessed the analgesic effects using four different outcome variables: patient-reported pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS); proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in pain; need for rescue medication; and pain recurrence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:57:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>A total of 50 studies (5734 participants) were included in this review and 37 studies (4483 participants) contributed to our meta-analyses. Selection bias was low in 34% of the studies or unclear in 66%; performance bias was low in 74%, high in 14% and unclear in 12%; attrition bias was low in 82% and high in 18%; selective reporting bias low in 92% of the studies; and other biases (industry funding) was high in 4%, unclear in 18% and low in 78%.</P>
<P>Patient-reported pain (VAS) results varied widely with high heterogeneity observed. For those comparisons which could be pooled we observed the following: NSAIDs significantly reduced pain compared to antispasmodics (5 studies, 303 participants: MD -12.97, 95% CI -21.80 to - 4.14; I² = 74%) and combination therapy of NSAIDs plus antispasmodics was significantly more effective in pain control than NSAID alone (2 studies, 310 participants: MD -1.99, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.40; I² = 0%).</P>
<P>NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain by 50% within the first hour (3 studies, 197 participants: RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.51; I² = 15%). Indomethacin was found to be less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 412 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60; I² = 55%). NSAIDs were significantly more effective than hyoscine in pain reduction (5 comparisons, 196 participants: RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.70; I² = 28%). The combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs only (9 comparisons, 906 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; I² = 59%). The results were mixed when NSAIDs were compared to other non-opioid medications.</P>
<P>When the need for rescue medication was evaluated, Patients receiving NSAIDs were significantly less likely to require rescue medicine than those receiving placebo (4 comparisons, 180 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60; I² = 24%) and NSAIDs were more effective than antispasmodics (4 studies, 299 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84; I² = 65%). Combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs (7 comparisons, 589 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; I² = 10%). Indomethacin was less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 517 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94; I² = 14%) except for lysine acetyl salicylate (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.65).</P>
<P>Pain recurrence was reported by only three studies which could not be pooled: a higher proportion of patients treated with 75 mg diclofenac (IM) showed pain recurrence in the first 24 hours of follow-up compared to those treated with 40 mg piroxicam (IM) (60 participants: RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81); no significant difference in pain recurrence at 72 hours was observed between piroxicam plus phloroglucinol and piroxicam plus placebo groups (253 participants: RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.15 to12.75); and there was no significant difference in pain recurrence within 72 hours of discharge between IM piroxicam and IV paracetamol (82 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54).</P>
<P>Side effects were presented inconsistently, but no major events were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-26 12:48:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Although due to variability in studies (inclusion criteria, outcome variables and interventions) and the evidence is not of highest quality, we still believe that NSAIDs are an effective treatment for renal colic when compared to placebo or antispasmodics. The addition of antispasmodics to NSAIDS does not result in better pain control. Data on other types of non-opioid, non-NSAID medication was scarce.</P>
<P>Major adverse effects are not reported in the literature for the use of NSAIDs for treatment of renal colic.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:59:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-31 14:41:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Renal or ureteric colic is a symptom complex that is characteristic for the presence of obstructing urinary tract calculi. Urolithiasis is a relatively common disease and its incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide due to lifestyle and dietary factors. The prevalence of urolithiasis is estimated at between 10% and 15% in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Pearle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearle 2012</LINK>). Caucasian males are more likely to develop urinary calculi (<LINK REF="REF-Menon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menon 2002</LINK>).The symptoms include flank or abdominal pain radiating to the groin or genitalia. The central factors in the pathogenesis of renal colic are obstruction of the urinary flow and increased pressure proximal to the point of blockage. The increasing pressure stimulates the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins promote vasodilation and increased urine output leading to higher pressure inside the collecting system. Renal colic pain is typically intense. Nausea and vomiting are common. Although most calculi pass spontaneously and do not need surgical intervention, during this period patients may suffer from severe pain. Therefore, satisfactory analgesia is of paramount importance in their management.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-26 13:19:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>A wide range of drugs (opioids and non-opioids) are used to treat pain and discomfort in patients with acute renal colic. The non-opioid drugs include but not limited to: NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs), antispasmodics, acetaminophen, calcium channel blockers and desmopressin. NSAIDs are commonly used as standard analgesics and opioids are used as rescue medications for acute renal colic. These two groups of medications have been compared in a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Holdgate-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdgate 2005a</LINK>). In this present study we compared the analgesic effects of non-opioids for acute renal colic. NSAIDs mainly work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme which induces a subsequent inhibition in prostaglandin synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1971</LINK>). Antispasmodic medications are sometimes used alone or in combination with other analgesics for treatment of acute renal colic and work by inducing smooth muscle relaxation in urinary tract. Acetaminophen which is a non-salicylate with weak anti-inflammatory potency is thought to work by inhibition of a third isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-3) (<LINK REF="REF-Chandrasekharan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandrasekharan 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-06 16:48:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During the initial phase of obstruction glomerular vasodilation leads to increase urine output and further increase in intra-ureteral pressure. This in turn results in prostaglandin synthesis in the ureteral wall, contraction of smooth muscle and further pain. Thus, pain control may be aimed at inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis (prostaglandin inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), reducing spastic ureteral contraction (antispasmodics) or diminishing the pain by intervening at the level of central nervous system (opioids) (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmi 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:59:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>A plethora of NSAIDs has been used for renal colic, belonging to different classes. In a systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Holdgate-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdgate 2005a</LINK>, NSAIDs and opioids were both effective in the management of renal colic but there was higher risk of nausea and vomiting with opioids. There is no systematic review of the efficacy and side effects of these different agents or classes. In addition NSAIDs have not been compared to other non-opioid medications in terms of their efficacy and side effect profiles.</P>

<P>The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that may be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts was screened independently by two authors, who discarded studies that were not applicable, however studies and reviews that included relevant data or information on trials were retained initially. Two authors independently assessed retrieved abstracts and, if necessary the full text, of these studies to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>Data extraction was carried out by the same reviewers independently using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one trial existed, only the publication with the most complete data was included. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with a third author.</P>
<P>Two authors independently carried out data abstraction and quality assessments. Again, a consensus meeting was held with all authors to agree on the assessments for each included study.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-05-17 09:56:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Data was pooled using the random effects model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (patient-rated pain scores, time to pain relief), the mean difference (MD) was used. When different scales were used and adequate data was not available to calculate standardized mean difference, we classified the findings into two categories: reduction in pain score more than 50% and less than 50%. Need for rescue medication and pain recurrence were treated as dichotomous outcomes.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-03-05 05:37:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Kourosh Afshar">
<P>Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I² values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age and the pathology (e.g. size and location of stone). Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to prior agent(s) used and the agent, mode of administration dose and duration of therapy. Variability in timing of post intervention assessment is another source of heterogeneity.<BR/>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-05-25 12:15:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>VAS-100 mm (Visual Analogue Scale), VAS-10 cm, or total pain relief at the beginning of the study and at different time points during the study periods were collected. When the number or proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief (dichotomous data) were available this was extracted. TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) at the enrolment at and over 15 to 30 minutes, one to two hours, and six hours or sufficient data to allow their calculation were extracted.</P>
<P>A global rating of the effect of a single dose of study medication was extracted when no other information was available. Patient's global evaluation using a standard 3-point scale (no relief, partial relief, complete relief) or 2-point scale (complete to moderate relief, mild or no pain relief) was collected, and dichotomous information was extracted for each category. Information from the top two categories of the patient global rating has been shown to produce very similar estimates of analgesic efficacy to information from standard pain relief and pain intensity measurement scales (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>). Data on complete pain relief in 3-point scale and complete or to moderate relief in the 2-point scale was used for the purpose of this analysis. Weighted means (by inverse of variance) were calculated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Reporting adverse effects was variable. Some studies provided detailed tables and some did not cite any side effects (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In addition reporting the side effects was further complicated by variation in definitions. No study reported serious adverse effects such as gastro-intestinal bleeding or kidney impairment. Overall, when comparing different NSAIDs, gastrointestinal adverse effects seemed to be a common occurrence (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In studies which compared NSAIDs with non-NSAIDs, gastro-intestinal and central nervous system adverse effects seemed to be more common among the NSAID groups (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:57:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>In this review, our objective was to assess the analgesic efficacy and side effects of different non-opioids including NSAIDs. This proved to be a challenging task due to a multitude of reasons discussed below.</P>
<P>Our systematic search of the literature yielded 53 studies eligible for review. All studies only included adult patients. Some studies required radiologic evidence of a urinary stone as inclusion criteria and others included patients based on clinical findings. This inconsistency in diagnostic criteria is a potential source of heterogeneity. Although one may argue that as a clinician (dealing with a patient requiring urgent analgesics) decision making based on clinical findings is more realistic and practical.</P>
<P>The studies involved many different medications. Among NSAIDs, metamizole, diclofenac and indomethacin were the most commonly used. Metamizole (dipyrone) is not used in many parts of the world due to the rare but serious hematologic side effect of aplastic anaemia. We have included this medication in our study. Overall NSAIDs were more effective than placebo in alleviating renal colic pain as shown in three relatively old studies. NSAIDs have not been compared to placebo in more recent studies most likely due to ethical issues of using placebo to treat a patient with acute severe pain.</P>
<P>NSAIDs as a group were more efficacious than or comparable to antispasmodics or other non NSAID analgesics. This finding was consistent when proportions of patients with more than 50% reduction in pain or requiring rescue medication or patient reported pain scores were evaluated. In addition, the combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs alone for all assessed outcomes. Patients on combination therapy (NSAID plus antispasmodic) reported lower pain VAS, however the difference was not clinically significant.</P>
<P>Among different types of NSAIDs, higher doses of dipyrone (2 g) seemed to be more efficacious than diclofenac in obtaining long lasting pain relief, and IV doses of dipyrone significantly reduced the need for rescue medication compared to IM doses of dipyrone in one study. Regarding proportion of patients with 50% reduction in pain and need for rescue medication, indomethacin was less effective than other types of NSAIDs.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-31 15:01:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Data from many studies could not be pooled due to difference in interventions, outcomes measured or presentation of data.</P>
<P>This current review has several limitations common to most systematic reviews. Most of the analyses exhibit significant heterogeneity. Although the presented results are from a random effects model we did not find any significant change when a fixed effect model was used. This points to the fact that the source of heterogeneity is not statistical. There are multiple sources including different inclusion criteria, interventions and outcome measures. For instance, not all NSAIDs may have the same effect on renal colic. Even in the case of the same medication the route of administration and dosing may have been different.</P>
<P>We found the outcome measures a challenging issue. Different measures such as VAS, binary or ordinal measures have been used. The time of outcome assessment was quite variable as well. To overcome this problem we grouped studies together that presented the outcomes as a continuous variable. We also estimated the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain in the first hour. We elected to use this measure because of the universal availability of pain assessment results in the first hour. In addition we believe this is a relevant clinical outcome. Synthesis of data at times required some degree of judgment from the authors. Some studies allowed a second dose of the protocol medication or opioids in the case of inadequate pain control. In this situation we only pooled data corresponding to the period before administration of the second dose.</P>
<P>Severe adverse effects such as digestive tract bleeding, renal impairment and in the case of metamizole, blood dyscrasia, were not reported. Recent reports from Sweden have suggested a rate of one case of agranulocytosis in 1700 based on six cases in 10,000 prescriptions. The thoroughness and length of follow up for adverse effect is unknown. Therefore underestimation of adverse effects, especially those manifested beyond the short follow up, is quite possible. It seems minor central nervous symptoms such as dizziness, gastro-intestinal complaints such as nausea and injection site erythema formed the majority of the adverse effects. We were not able to pool these data to perform a meaningful meta-analysis. There was insufficient information of adequate quality for any safety analysis. A recent meta-analysis has shown increased risk of cardiovascular event in patients using diclofenac, similar to Cox-2 inhibitors. This has resulted in a European wide adverse event alert for this medication (<LINK REF="REF-CNT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNT 2013</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-25 11:55:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The overall quality of the studies was fair. The main issues were unclear methods of randomisation and concealment. In some studies the outcome assessor was not blinded. Since the outcomes were assessed in the same visit, incomplete follow-up was rare.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-05-31 14:07:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The published protocol was followed to avoid any bias in the review process. Nevertheless, we had to make judgement calls when combining studies and their outcomes. The main challenge in this review is to explain the effects.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:57:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Medication used in the treatment of acute renal colic can be categorized in the two broad groups of opioids and non-opioids. The most commonly used non-opioids are NSAIDs. <LINK REF="REF-Holdgate-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdgate 2005a</LINK> compared NSAIDs to opioids and found: "Single bolus doses of both NSAIDs and opioids provide pain relief to patients with acute renal colic". However, patients receiving NSAIDs achieve greater reduction in pain scores and are less likely to require further analgesia in the short term (<LINK REF="REF-Holdgate-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdgate 2005a</LINK>). To our knowledge, this is the first review investigating NSAIDs and non-opioids for acute renal colic.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-10 10:57:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Despite variability in the studies and the evidence not being of the highest quality, we still believe that NSAIDs are an effective treatment for renal colic when compared to placebo or antispasmodics. The addition of antispasmodics to NSAIDs does not result in better pain control. The findings of this review support the use commonly available NSAID such as diclofenac, indomethacin, or ketorolac. We remain uncertain as the effect of metamizole on blood dyscrasia. However, in the presence of other interventions with more certain safety profiles the justification of its use is more difficult, unless there is a remarkable difference in the cost. Data on other types of non-opioid, non-NSAID medication is scarce.</P>
