<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight, and the health of these persons can be improved with weight loss. Weight loss is very difficult to achieve in the long-term, however, particularly among persons with diabetes. This systematic review of diet, physical activity, and behavioral interventions for weight loss, revealed a decrease in weight of 1.7 kg at one year or more. These results were minimized by weight loss in the comparison group, however. No data were identified on quality of life or mortality. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with diabetes. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of lifestyle and behavioral weight loss and weight control interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:44:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with hand searches of selected journals and consultation with experts in obesity research.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were published or unpublished randomized controlled trials in any language, and examined weight loss or weight control strategies using one or more dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions, with a follow-up interval of at least 12 months. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Effects were combined using a random effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:44:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The 22 studies of weight loss interventions identified had a 4,659 participants and follow-up of 1 to 5 years. The pooled weight loss for any intervention in comparison to usual care among 585 subjects was 1.7 kg (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.3 to 3.2), or 3.1% of baseline body weight among 517 subjects. Other main comparisons demonstrated non significant results: among 126 persons receiving a physical activity and behavioral intervention, those who also received a very low calorie diet lost 3.0 kg (95% CI -0.5 to 6.4), or 1.6% of baseline body weight, more than persons receiving a low-calorie diet. Among 53 persons receiving identical dietary and behavioral interventions, those receiving more intense physical activity interventions lost 3.9 kg (95% CI -1.9 to 9.7), or 3.6% of baseline body weight, more than those receiving a less intense or no physical activity intervention. Comparison groups often achieved significant weight loss (up to 10.0 kg), minimizing between-group differences. Changes in glycated hemoglobin generally corresponded to changes in weight and were not significant when between-group differences were examined. No data were identified on quality of life and mortality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Weight loss strategies using dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced small between-group improvements in weight. These results were minimized by weight loss in the comparison group, however, and examination of individual study arms revealed that multicomponent interventions including very low calorie diets or low calorie diets may hold promise for achieving weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:35:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>The prevalence of obesity and diabetes continues to increase in the developed world, with recent self-reported, survey data indicating that more than 56% of adults are overweight, and about 20% are obese (<LINK REF="REF-Mokad-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokad 2001</LINK>). Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and obesity as a BMI of &#8805;30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). Of U.S. adults over the age of 20 years, 8.6% have diabetes, of which one third are undiagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2002</LINK>). Both obesity and weight gain are major risk factors for diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pi_x002d_Sunyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pi-Sunyer 2000</LINK>) and every 1-kg increase in average self-reported weight is associated with a 9% relative increase in the prevalence of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Mokdad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokdad 2000</LINK>). Eighty to ninety percent of persons with type 2 diabetes are obese (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>) and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with diabetes, particularly hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>One of the cornerstones of diabetes care for overweight persons is weight loss, as insulin sensitivity and glycemic control improve (<LINK REF="REF-Pi_x002d_Sunyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pi-Sunyer 2000</LINK>), and moderate, intentional weight loss is associated with a reduced mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2000</LINK>). For persons with diabetes, weight loss improves lipid profiles, decreasing triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and improves blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>), mental health, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1991</LINK>). However, these benefits are thought to be clinically meaningful only if weight loss is sustained over time (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dietary and behavioral treatment for weight loss can produce an average loss of 8% of initial body weight over 3 to 12 months (NHLBI 1998). However, it is difficult to define effective weight control measures for the long term in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 1998</LINK>). The majority of obese patients regain most of the weight initially lost in successful interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>). Skender and colleagues note that most of the weight lost in the early phase (16 to 20 weeks) is regained within 2 to 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Skender-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skender 1996</LINK>). Even when weight loss is effectively achieved using consistent, multi-factorial behavioral therapy for 6 months or more, one-third of weight loss is usually regained over the subsequent year (<LINK REF="REF-Perri-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perri 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Obese or overweight persons with diabetes may face different and additional issues from non-diabetic persons trying to achieve weight loss. Studies suggest that persons with diabetes lose less weight than nondiabetic persons and they regain their weight more rapidly (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>), although the mechanisms responsible are unclear and the validity of this observation has not been systematically examined. (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>). Complex treatment regimens for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia complicate behavioral change aimed at weight reduction.</P>
<P>It is thus important to evaluate the scope of our knowledge on the effectiveness of dietary, physical activity, and behavioral interventions for weight loss and weight control in type 2 diabetes. Behavioral strategies are based on behavioral and learning principles and provide tools for overcoming barriers to improving and optimizing diet and physical activity levels. Most importantly, effective long-term interventions must be defined for these populations. In addition, it is important to determine areas of uncertainty where further research is needed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:34:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We have identified two relevant systematic reviews in the English literature. Brown et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>) examined the effectiveness of weight loss interventions in obese persons with type 2 diabetes. They searched the published and unpublished English language literature prior to 1995. Outlier studies were removed to achieve homogeneity, interventions were stratified very broadly (all behavioral interventions in one stratum, for example), and pooled effects included all types of study designs (i.e. pre versus post and randomized controlled trials). These researchers found that diet alone had the largest effect on weight loss and metabolic control, while behavioral therapies alone and exercise alone produced the smallest changes in weight. They found few studies with follow-up intervals longer than 6 months.</P>
<P>Ciliska et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Ciliska-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciliska 1995</LINK>) also reviewed the literature on the results of weight loss in obese persons with non-insulin dependent diabetes. They searched the published, English language literature from 1985 forward and included only studies with a comparison group. They synthesized studies in a narrative fashion, and concluded that weight loss and metabolic control can be achieved, but not maintained.</P>
<P>These two reviews provide useful information but are outdated. Another useful summary is that of Boulé and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Boule-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boule 2001</LINK>) in a meta-analysis (based on a Cochrane review) of the effects of exercise on glycemic control and BMI in type 2 diabetes. They focused on predetermined programs of physical activity, and did not focus on weight loss as a goal for studies included in their review.</P>
<P>The aims of this review are to provide a comprehensive examination of the effectiveness of long-term weight loss and weight control interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes. This review will be updated at regular intervals to reflect the addition of new research.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:44:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of 12 months or greater as long-term weight loss is needed to produce effects on health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease events (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>). We define follow-up period as the time from randomization until the last measurement in the study. The intervention itself may be of any duration. We had initially planned to include all types of study designs, however, since we identified an adequate number of RCTs, we decided to restrict this review to RCTs only.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:44:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Participants were persons &#8805;18 years of age with type 2 diabetes. If the type of diabetes was not specified, studies were included if they involved adults with diabetes, with or without insulin treatment. Studies of mixed type 1 and type 2 populations were included if outcomes were reported separately for persons with type 2 diabetes. Persons labelled with "non-insulin-dependent diabetes" (NIDDM) were assumed to have type 2 diabetes. Studies involving only "insulin-dependent diabetes" (IDDM) participants were excluded unless there was information to indicate that they had type 2 disease (e.g., concurrent use of oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin).</P>
<P>The acceptable diagnostic criteria for diabetes included those described by the National Diabetes Data Group standards (<LINK REF="REF-NDDG-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDDG 1979</LINK>), the World Health Organization standards (<LINK REF="REF-Alberti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>) or the American Diabetes Association standards (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>). If the diagnostic criteria were not given in the study, the author's statement of the diagnosis of diabetes among study participants was accepted.</P>
<P>Study participants were of any weight or BMI at baseline; they did not have to be overweight or obese. Weight loss or weight maintenance decreases cardiovascular risk in persons with a BMI less than 25.0 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ornish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ornish 1998</LINK>) (the lower limit for overweight). In addition, when Brown and colleagues reviewed weight loss interventions in diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>) they found that many studies did not clearly identify participants as overweight or obese, and when they used overweight/obese as an inclusion criteria they had to eliminate many studies.

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:44:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Interventions included in the review had weight loss or weight control as one of the primary stated goals of the intervention. Interventions where weight loss is a secondary or unexpected result were not included. Interventions focused on the patient, rather than the provider or health care system. Interventions which focus on changing provider behavior were excluded, even when outcomes are measured in the patient (e.g., an intervention to educate providers about weight loss counselling, with patient weight the main outcome).</P>
<P>Interventions were classified as dietary, physical activity, or behavioral strategies. Dietary programs involve providing recommendations and/or material support for achieving a specific dietary regime where the goal is weight loss or weight control. All types of dietary programs initiated for the purpose of weight loss or control were examined in this review, including low-calorie diets (800 to 1,500 kcal/day) and very low calorie diets (&lt;800 kcal/day) (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). Studies were excluded if the sole purpose of the intervention was nutrition education or to teach about diet (e.g., carbohydrate and fat exchanges, food consumption and the relationship to glycemia), but not explicitly to achieve weight loss or weight control.</P>
<P>Physical activity programs were included if one of the primary goals of the program was to achieve weight loss or weight control by increased physical activity. Physical activity interventions included a specific approach to increasing activity levels, including counseling, an exercise prescription, or participation in either a supervised or unsupervised exercise program. When it was simply stated that participants were advised to increase their level of exercise, with no details of the intervention, was not considered a physical activity program.</P>
<P>Behavioral strategies are based on behavioral and learning principles and address barriers to diet or physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). These strategies include one or more of the following interventions: education, cognitive-behavioral therapy (e.g., stimulus control, reinforcement, goal setting), social support, or psychotherapy.</P>
<P>Studies were included that examined the combined effect of two or more of the interventions discussed above.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Excluded interventions</HEADING>
<P>We excluded pharmacologic therapy, surgery, acupuncture, and hypnosis for the purpose of weight loss as these interventions have very different mechanisms of action and are best dealt with by a separate review.

<P>Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and text words, we searched the following databases between the date indicated and May 2004: MEDLINE (1966), EMBASE (1980), CINAHL (1982), ERIC (1980), PsychInfo (1967), Web of Science (1981), Biosis (1969), Nutrition Abstracts and Review (1980), <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2004, issue 2), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2004, issue 2). We manually searched journals expected to have the highest relevance, from 1980: Diabetes Care, International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders, Obesity Research (commenced in 1993), American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, and Journal of the American Dietetic Association. Lists of all included studies and relevant reviews were examined and experts in obesity were consulted for additional citations. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 1998 review (NHLBI 1998) and the University of York, National Health Centre for Reviews and Dissemination review (<LINK REF="REF-UYCRD-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UYCRD 1997</LINK>) were reviewed for relevant citations.</P>

<P>For studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria, two reviewers independently abstracted relevant population and intervention characteristics using a standardized template and consensus was achieved through discussion. Outcomes examined included weight loss, percent weight loss (based on individual data), BMI, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and lipid concentrations. Abstraction of data was not blinded, as there is no evidence that blinding of this process decreases bias in the conduct of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwig 1994</LINK>). We attempted to contact the authors for missing data or when we needed clarification of the data presented.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes we abstracted for each study group the baseline sample size, pre- and post- intervention mean and measure of dispersion (SD [standard deviation], standard error of the mean (SEM), or 95% confidence interval) for the intervention and comparison groups.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:39:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>When data were available which were sufficiently similar with respect to interventions and outcomes, pooled estimates of effect were obtained using Review Manager software. For continuous variables reported in the same scale, the absolute differences in outcome between each follow-up and the baseline measure was reported for each study group (delta I and delta C). The estimate of variance of (delta I) and (delta C) was calculated from the outcome measures in each study group using the formula Vpre+ Vpost - 2r(SDpre*SDpost), where Vpre is the variance of the mean baseline outcome, Vpost is the variance of the mean follow-up outcome, r is the correlation between the baseline and follow-up values, and SDpre and SDpost are the standard errors of the baseline and follow-up groups, respectively. The variance of (delta) was then calculated as the sum of the variance of (delta I) and the variance of (delta C). Because studies do not report r, and its true value is unknown, a sensitivity analysis was performed using values of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0. Tabular data and the figure are presented using r=0.75, unless otherwise noted.</P>
<P>Data were pooled using the random-effects model, with the DerSimonian and Laird formula for calculating between-study variance (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1954</LINK>). Each study was weighted by the inverse of the study variance.</P>
<P>Meta-regression was performed to determine whether various study-level characteristics (follow-up interval, duration of the intervention, number of intervention contacts, total attrition, year of publication) affected the between-group change in weight. We examined interaction terms for all models. We used SAS for the meta-regression (version 8.02, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.).</P>

<P>The effects of interventions on between-group change in weight are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. Due to heterogeneity of interventions and comparisons, we believed it appropriate to obtain pooled estimates for only three groups of studies (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) any intervention versus usual care, very low calorie diet versus low calorie diet, and physical activity versus no or less intensive physical activity. In the first group (seven studies with available data; one study had two intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1985-_x0028_BM_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1985 (BM)</LINK>) the intervention group received a dietary intervention with or without a behavioral or activity intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1985-_x0028_BM_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1985 (BM)</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korhonen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Korhonen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pissarek-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pissarek 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zapotoczky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zapotoczky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trento--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Trento 2001</LINK>), and the pooled effect for interventions with a follow-up between 1 and 2 years was a reduction in weight of 1.7 kg (95% CI, 0.3 to 3.2) (585 subjects) (3.1% of baseline weight, 517 subjects). In the two studies that compared very low calorie diets with low calorie diets (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>) the pooled effect was a nonsignificant reduction of 3.0 kg (95% CI, -0.5 to 6.4) (1.6% of baseline weight) (126 subjects) at 72 and 104 weeks of follow-up. In the two studies by Wing et al. reported in a single article (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988a-_x0028_Study-1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988a (Study 1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988a-_x0028_Study-2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988a (Study 2)</LINK>), in which a combination of dietary, physical activity, and behavioral interventions was compared to identical interventions with either no or less physical activity, the pooled effect among 53 subjects was also not significant: a loss of 3.9 kg (95% CI, -1.9 to 9.7) (3.6%).<BR/>
<BR/>Within-group changes in weight for the intervention and comparison groups are presented in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>. Effects are pooled by intervention type, regardless of randomization (i.e., each study arm is treated as a pre- versus post-design study). Weight change for control groups ranged from a gain of 2.1 kg (a group receiving usual care) (<LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1993</LINK>) to a loss of 8.2 kg (a 1000 kcal/day deficit diet with 20 visits over 52 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1986</LINK>)). In the intervention groups, weight loss ranged from 0.6 kg (a 5-visit intervention with group counseling on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (39)) to 8.6 kg (a combined in-patient out-patient 800 kcal/day diet (<LINK REF="STD-Pissarek-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pissarek 1980</LINK>)). More marked weight loss was noted in an intervention group (14.5 kg) as well as in the control group (10.0 kg) at preliminary (1 year) follow-up with a very low calorie diet combined with a physical activity and a behavioral intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1995</LINK>). The pooled effects for six intervention types, including usual care (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), revealed that all produced significant (p&lt;0.05) weight loss, with a very low calorie diet combined with physical activity and behavioral therapy producing the largest effect.</P>

<P>The funnel plot was asymmetric, indicating potential small sample bias (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). For net change in weight, we found no significant interactions with follow-up interval, duration of the intervention, number of intervention contacts, or year of publication and weight.

<P>Sensitivity analyses showed only minor changes in pooled estimates and 95% CI when the correlation between pre- and post- values was assigned different values. Because most studies did not report components of quality that were assessed (method of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding of the assessor), we could not examine the effects of these variables on outcomes.</P>
<P>Pooled effects for studies reporting only HbA1c produced no significant differences from the outcomes achieved by converting HbA1 measures to HbA1c. The performance of stratified analyses was limited by sparse data and there were not enough studies to examine whether a physical activity intervention increased the effectiveness of dietary interventions.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:43:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Randomized, controlled trials of weight loss interventions using diet with or without physical activity or behavioral interventions report only small additional declines in weight and HbA1c over those achieved by comparison groups. A partial explanation for these small changes is that the comparison group often had moderate weight loss (up to 10.0 kg), minimizing between-group differences. Cointerventions and contamination of the comparison group, as well as the "intervention effect" of study participation likely contributed to weight loss in comparison groups.</P>
<P>Our examination of weight change in individual study arms (intervention and comparison) produced somewhat more promising results. Although not large, the magnitude of weight loss demonstrated from combined dietary, physical activity, and behavioral interventions is associated with improved health outcomes (NHLBI 1998). Sustained, intensive interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Pissarek-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pissarek 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zapotoczky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zapotoczky 2001</LINK>) and combined initial (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991a</LINK>) or intermittent (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>) very low calorie diet appear to have the most effect on weight loss, and a low calorie diet combined with physical activity and behavioral interventions was also effective (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988a-_x0028_Study-1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988a (Study 1)</LINK>). However, these conclusions are based on a small number of studies and it is well established that healthy changes in diet and physical activity are difficult to maintain in the long-term (NHLBI 1998; <LINK REF="REF-Glenny-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenny 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of our analysis of single arms of studies must be interpreted with caution. The observed effects are not confined to the effect of the intervention, as in our analysis of between-group change, where the groups were obtained through randomization. Extraneous factors, both known and unknown, may be responsible for the observed effects.</P>
<P>At a population level, a decrease in weight of 2 to 3 kg and a decrease in HbA1c of 0.3% may well have significant health benefits, whether through small improvements in a large segment of the population, or through larger benefits achieved among the population subset with more substantial weight or HbA1c reductions (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our review has limitations. First, the studies examined were very heterogeneous with respect to the interventions, limiting quantitative syntheses. Second, we had insufficient power to examine either the effectiveness of specific component interventions, or the relationships between intervention characteristics and outcomes. Third, this review is limited to published studies; although we contacted experts for additional unpublished data, none was obtained. Fourth, attrition is an important issue in weight loss studies because selective loss to follow-up has been demonstrated; higher attrition occurs among those who do not achieve a weight loss goal (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1989</LINK>), as demonstrated here with a positive relationship between higher attrition rates and increased weight loss among completers. Participants were most commonly self-selected and thus possibly more motivated to complete the study; applicability to general populations may thus be limited. Fifth, the quality of individual studies in this review varied. Adequate randomization procedures and concealment of allocation were reported in only a few studies and blinding of the assessor was rarely implemented. Sixth, the funnel plot indicated potential small sample bias; in other words, the published studies identified in this review, with relatively small sample sizes, may represent a subset of the total body of literature. The identified studies may represent a select group reporting more weight loss than might be found if the total body of literature was available.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:43:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Our findings are consistent with those found in non-diabetic populations, where comprehensive, intensive group dietary and behavioral programs produced similar mean losses in weight: 8 kg to 10 kg at 6 months with a regain of 30% to 35% of weight loss at 1 year (<LINK REF="REF-Wadden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1989</LINK>). Our finding that very low calorie diets are not significantly more effective than low calorie diets in a small number of studies is not inconsistent with the conclusions of a prior review that found the two interventions equally effective in general populations at greater than 1 year of follow-up (NHLBI 1998). A comprehensive review of the effectiveness of weight-loss interventions in persons with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>) indicated that dietary interventions alone produced an average weight loss of 9 kg and behavioral programs alone a loss of 3 kg at short-term follow-up; few studies examined outcomes beyond 6 months.</P>
<P>Healthy lifestyle changes with weight loss and a decrease in diabetes incidence have been demonstrated in the long-term among persons with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, who are at high risk of developing diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-DPPRG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPPRG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK> ). Whether the lifestyle interventions in these two large trials can be translated to diabetic populations has yet to be determined, although we also found that more intensive and sustained interventions may be more effective.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In conclusion, weight loss and control in the long term appear to be difficult to achieve for adults with type 2 diabetes employing currently used lifestyle and behavioral strategies, although we found a clinically meaningful decrease in weight with some interventions. Perhaps other strategies in conjunction with lifestyle interventions should be considered for weight loss or control. Pharmacotherapy achieves modest, but statistically significant, weight loss over 26 to 52 weeks in general populations (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2004</LINK>). Surgical interventions can produce substantial weight loss at up to 10 years of follow-up in general populations (<LINK REF="REF-Pories-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pories 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sjostrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjostrom 1999</LINK>) and among persons with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Pories-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pories 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>). Much remains to be learned about how to implement dietary, physical activity, and behavioral interventions designed to achieve weight loss and weight control in the long term and whether intensive interventions such as those successfully used in persons with impaired glucose tolerance are effective among diabetic populations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research needs to focus on sustained interventions for weight loss and control and long-term outcomes for health and quality of life. The economic efficiency of effective long-term weight loss interventions needs to be established. Effective interventions for weight control in persons not currently overweight need further attention. Methodologic standards need to be followed with rigorous application of good study design principles: allocation concealment, minimization of attrition, follow-up of dropouts, comparison of dropouts to completers at baseline, and intention-to-treat analyses. </P>
