<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Currently there is no clear evidence that cholesterol drugs reduce melanoma risk.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Some studies have suggested that medicines (such as statins and fibrates) taken to lower blood cholesterol may reduce the risk of melanoma skin cancer. Our review of 16 studies did not find any clear evidence to support such a suggestion, but we cannot exclude a useful effect of such drugs until more studies become available.<BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-10-13 13:49:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Effective treatment for advanced melanoma is lacking. While no drug therapy currently exists for prevention of melanoma, in vitro, case-control, and animal model evidence suggest that lipid-lowering medications, commonly taken for high cholesterol, might prevent melanoma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of statin or fibrate lipid-lowering medications on melanoma outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (February 2003), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (to March 2003), EMBASE (to September 2003), CANCERLIT (to October 2002), Web of Science (to May 2003), and reference lists of articles. We approached study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for additional information (published or unpublished studies).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials involving random allocation of study participants, where experimental groups used statins or fibrates and participants were enrolled for at least four years of therapy. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three authors screened 109 abstracts of articles with titles of possible relevance. We then thoroughly examined the full text of 72 potentially relevant articles. We requested unpublished melanoma outcomes data from the corresponding author of each qualifying trial. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-13 13:49:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We identified 16 qualifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (7 statin, 9 fibrate). Thirteen of these trials (involving 62,197 participants) provided data on incident melanomas (6 statin, 7 fibrate). A total of 66 melanomas were reported in groups receiving the experimental drug and 86 in groups receiving placebo or other control therapies. For statin trials this translated to an odds ratio of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.44) and for fibrate trials an odds ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.82).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses failed to show statistically significant differences in melanoma outcomes by gender, melanoma occurrence after two years of participation in trial, stage or histology, or trial funding. Subgroup analysis by type of fibrate or statin also failed to show statistically significant differences, except for the statin subgroup analysis which showed reduced melanoma incidence for lovastatin, based on one trial only (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.99).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The melanoma outcomes data collected in this review of RCTs of statins and fibrates does not exclude the possibility that these drugs prevent melanoma. There was a 10% and 42% reduction for participants on statins and fibrates, respectively, however these results were not statistically significant. Until further evidence is established, limiting exposure to ultraviolet radiation remains the most effective way to reduce the risk of melanoma.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-13 13:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Several lines of evidence suggest that the lipid-lowering medications commonly taken for high cholesterol may prevent melanoma. This review examined whether melanoma occurred less frequently in people who had taken the type of lipid-lowering medications known as statins and fibrates, compared with those who had not.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definitions: Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer </HEADING>
<P>Skin cancer is commonly divided into two forms: melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is a disease that primarily occurs in people of lighter skin colour and occurs when pigment cells known as melanocytes grow in an uncontrolled fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>). Normally, melanocytes endow the skin with its natural colour and account for the formation of naevi (moles). Non-melanoma skin cancer also favours people of lighter skin colour, but involves the squamous and basal cells of the skin rather than melanocytes. While melanoma accounts for only 4% of skin cancer cases, it accounts for roughly 79% of skin cancer deaths in the US (<A HREF="http://www.cancer.org">http://www.cancer.org</A>), largely owing to its tendency to metastasise to other parts of the body, including the liver, lungs, and brain. The limited success of available treatments and high cost of therapies used to treat advanced melanoma leave many, especially those at high risk of developing melanoma, eagerly awaiting the discovery of a means of prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Melanomas are often recognized by using the 'ABCDE' (asymmetry, borders, colour, diameter, evolving) memory guide: one looks for skin growths that are Asymmetrical (one half does not look like the other half), that have ragged, irregular Borders, that contain unusual Colours (red, white or blue) or irregular coloration, that have a large Diameter (are larger than a pencil eraser, or approximately 6 mm) and that are changing or Evolving (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1998</LINK>). For people with numerous moles, the 'ugly duckling' rule may also be a useful way to help distinguish a potentially dangerous melanoma from a benign lesion. That is, a malignant melanoma may raise suspicion simply because it looks different from surrounding moles (<LINK REF="REF-Grob-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grob 1998</LINK>). Because of the importance of early diagnosis of melanoma in determining prognosis, all changing, itching, and bleeding growths deserve timely evaluation by a health care professional.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology and impact </HEADING>
<P>The incidence of malignant melanoma continues to rise in the US, and constitutes a substantial public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Rigel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstock 2000</LINK>). The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2004 there will be 55,100 new cases of malignant melanoma, and 7910 deaths due to the disease in the US (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2004</LINK>). Because of its high rate of occurrence in young adults, melanoma ranks second only to adult leukaemia in years of potential life lost from adult-onset cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Albert-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albert 1990</LINK>). The annual direct costs of treating newly diagnosed melanoma in the US were estimated to be US$ 563 million more than 5 years ago and are likely to have increased with the rising incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Tsao-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsao 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Causes </HEADING>
<P>Several population studies have suggested that melanoma is most clearly associated with ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and that sunburn is the sun exposure variable most consistently associated with melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 1999</LINK>). Other melanoma risk factors identified include age (increasing risk with increasing age), race (white non-Hispanic &gt; white Hispanic &gt; Black or Asian), family history, number of moles (increasing risk with increasing number of moles), and gender (male &gt; female) (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berwick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berwick 1998</LINK>). Additional factors have also been associated with melanoma: red or blond hair, pre-skin cancer lesions (actinic keratoses), marked freckling of the upper back, 3 or more blistering sunburns prior to age 20, 3 or more years with outdoor summer jobs during teen years, and use of artificial tanning devices (<LINK REF="REF-Rigel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swerdlow-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swerdlow 1988</LINK>). Many of these factors may simply be substitute markers for total/intermittent ultraviolet radiation dose. Some argue that many melanoma risk factors are yet to be discovered (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prognosis </HEADING>
<P>The two most important factors in determining whether a melanoma is likely to spread to other parts of the body are whether ulceration (bleeding) is present and the depth of the tumour in the skin. Ten-year survival for patients with non-ulcerated localized melanomas, less than one millimetre (mm) in depth, is 88% (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2001</LINK>). If ulceration is present, the 10-year survival drops to 83%. Ten-year survival for melanoma 1 to 2 mm deep drops to 79% without ulceration and 64% with ulceration. In the most advanced category of localized melanoma, deeper than 4 mm with ulceration, 10-year survival drops to 32%. Patients with melanoma that has spread to multiple locations in the skin have a 10-year survival of 16% while those with metastases to the lungs have a 10-year survival of 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-13 13:51:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Chemoprevention is the use of medications to prevent a disease. For example, tamoxifen is considered a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. No medication is currently recognized as preventing melanoma.</P>
<P>The cells of many cancers, including melanoma, use cholesterol in a different way to non-cancerous cells (<LINK REF="REF-Fumagalli-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fumagalli 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Littman-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littman 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Versluis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Versluis 1996</LINK>). Therefore, medications that alter cholesterol levels may slow or stop tumour growth, enhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy, or possibly even prevent cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lenz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenz 1997</LINK>). In support of this theory, lovastatin, a medication commonly prescribed to people with high cholesterol levels, has displayed antitumour activity in experimental models of numerous cancers, including melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Jani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prassanna-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prassanna 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Case-control results suggest a role for statins in cancer prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Graaf-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graaf 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleijfer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleijfer 2005</LINK>). In addition, results from two large, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-year clinical trials of lipid-lowering agents for heart disease, have reported significantly fewer melanomas occurring in people taking lipid-lowering medications (<LINK REF="STD-AFCAPS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">AFCAPS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_HIT-1999" TYPE="STUDY">VA-HIT 1999</LINK>). The numbers of all other cancers, including prostate, colon, lung, lymphoma, bladder, and breast cancer, were not significantly different between groups of participants. The two studies used two different types of lipid-lowering medications: lovastatin, a member of the statin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor) drug class, and gemfibrozil, a member of the fibrate (fibric acid derivative) drug class. Statins and fibrates are thought to lower cholesterol in different ways (inhibition of cholesterol synthesis versus interaction with the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha, PPAR-alpha). Lovastatin and gemfibrozil have no known shared molecular mechanisms of action. However both lovastatin and gemfibrozil are associated with liver cancer in rodents (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1996</LINK>). Because of concern about the possibility of a similar association with cancer in humans and because meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials has suggested that lipid-lowering medications might increase rates of death not due to heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muldoon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muldoon 1990</LINK>), cancer incidence and death rates have been monitored in many clinical trials using these medications.</P>
<P>At the cellular level, lovastatin has been shown to slow the growth and proliferation of melanoma cells grown in the laboratory as well as to induce melanoma cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Feleszko-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feleszko 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feleszko-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feleszko 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordenberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shellman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shellman 2005</LINK>). Lovastatin also dramatically decreased the number of melanoma lung metastases in mice injected with melanoma cells (<LINK REF="REF-Jani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jani 1995</LINK>). Recently, the fibrate drug fenofibrate was shown to significantly decrease melanoma metastases in hamsters (<LINK REF="REF-Grabacka-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grabacka 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, evidence of effectiveness in vitro and in animal models does not necessarily translate to a similar effect in humans. Moreover, a drug's ability to slow the growth or spread of tumour cells may not correlate with a role in prevention. However, such evidence, together with lower observed melanoma rates in clinical trials, substantiates the appropriateness of further evaluation. The need for investigation of possible chemopreventive agents is heightened too by the inadequacy of currently available treatment for advanced melanoma. A systematic review of all available randomised, controlled, clinical trial evidence is thus called for to formally evaluate whether drugs such as lovastatin and gemfibrozil reduce melanoma risk in humans.</P>
<P>While lipid-lowering medications may hold promise for preventing melanoma, as well as other more common diseases, the use of these medications is not without risk; therefore randomised, controlled clinical trials need to be performed before preventive or therapeutic use in melanoma can be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Dellavalle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellavalle 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>We identified sixteen qualifying RCTs (7 statin, 9 fibrate) of which 13 provided data on incident melanomas (6 statin, 7 fibrate) (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). Fifty-nine incident melanomas were collectively reported in published trial papers (20 statins and fibrates, 39 placebo or other control therapies) and an additional 93 were identified in unpublished data via correspondence with trial authors (46 statins and fibrates, 47 placebo or other control therapies) (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Rates of melanoma incidence varied from 0.0 to 0.0016 melanomas per person per year (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials had previously reported statistically significantly fewer incident melanomas in treated participants (<LINK REF="STD-AFCAPS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">AFCAPS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_HIT-1999" TYPE="STUDY">VA-HIT 1999</LINK>). However none of the nine studies providing unpublished melanoma incidence data had significantly fewer incident melanomas in treated people. Three trials have not provided data on melanoma incidence: <LINK REF="STD-ALLHAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ALLHAT 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DIS-1991" TYPE="STUDY">DIS 1991</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-ROP-1992" TYPE="STUDY">ROP 1992</LINK>. The investigators from the <LINK REF="STD-ALLHAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ALLHAT 2002</LINK> study have stated they will not release this data until publication of a manuscript reporting cancer incidence in their study. The investigators from the <LINK REF="STD-DIS-1991" TYPE="STUDY">DIS 1991</LINK> study have stated that this Cochrane review does not possess high enough Institutional Review Board clearance to allow access to their data.

<P>Based on all acquired data, we found no significant association between lower melanoma incidence and the use of statins (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.44; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) or fibrates (odds ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.82; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>)</P>

<P>This analysis also failed to show statistically significant differences in all cases, except for the statin subgroup analysis which showed reduced melanoma incidence for lovastatin. However, we only included one trial in the analysis (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.99; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-AFCAPS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">AFCAPS 1998</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-04 13:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>This review examined the association of therapy (statins or fibrates) with an unanticipated secondary outcome (melanoma prevention). Two trials had previously reported statistically significantly fewer incident melanomas in treated participants (<LINK REF="STD-AFCAPS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">AFCAPS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_HIT-1999" TYPE="STUDY">VA-HIT 1999</LINK>). However, we found that additional unpublished data (melanoma incidence from trials that had not published this data) did not yield statistically significant evidence to support or exclude this association. More studies are needed to obtain sufficient power to exclude a potentially clinically useful effect.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-10-14 10:42:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>The dangers of publication bias were highlighted in this review. Both studies finding a significant decrease in melanoma incidence associated with drug therapy (<LINK REF="STD-AFCAPS-1998" TYPE="STUDY">AFCAPS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_HIT-1999" TYPE="STUDY">VA-HIT 1999</LINK>) published these results while only 2 of 11 studies showing no significant association published their results (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). This underscores the danger of drawing conclusions using only published data. Systematic reviews are often hindered by lack of access to unpublished data of qualifying trials. To minimize this barrier, our study contacted investigators possessing potentially relevant unpublished data and offered a monetary incentive for the provision of melanoma data (US$ 50 for each unpublished melanoma). Two studies requested payment of the monetary incentive offered (<LINK REF="STD-CDP-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CDP 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WOSCOP-1995" TYPE="STUDY">WOSCOP 1995</LINK>), and one study deemed the money essential for the retrieval of the melanoma outcomes data requested (<LINK REF="STD-CDP-1986" TYPE="STUDY">CDP 1986</LINK>). Additionally, we have no information on melanoma development in participants lost to follow up<I>.</I> Because event rates are so small, the potential impact of missing data could be substantial.</P>
<P>Given the lack of evidence to exclude the hypothesis that statins and fibrates prevent melanoma, further work to continue this investigation is needed. Corroborating evidence for fibrate use for melanoma prevention or treatment is minimal, however evidence for statin use for melanoma prevention or treatment continues to build: cohort studies support reduced risk of melanoma in people taking statins (<LINK REF="REF-Dellavalle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellavalle 2003</LINK>) and in vitro, statins induce melanoma apoptosis (cell death) and increase the cell killing effects of drugs used for melanoma chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Feleszko-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feleszko 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feleszko-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feleszko 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordenberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordenberg 1996</LINK>). Animal model data and in vitro work also suggest that statins might reduce melanoma migration potential and metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Collisson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collisson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jani 1995</LINK>). Thus this meta-analysis supports further research into the potential use of statins for melanoma prevention and the utility of testing statins as therapy, especially if combined with chemotherapy to produce synergistic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Sleijfer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleijfer 2005</LINK>). Given the paucity of effective therapies for advanced melanoma, Phase I and II clinical trials combining statins with chemotherapy might still appear reasonable to test whether this drug combination is tolerable and if so, more effective than current chemotherapy alone.</P>
<P>The systematic review had several limitations. The data came from 13 trials with mostly male participants using 6 different drugs. Cancer was not a primary endpoint of most of the included trials. Not all primary participant data regarding melanoma diagnosis was available. At least 1 item of histological data (such as Breslow depth, Clark level, histological subtype) was reported for only 32 out of 152 melanomas preventing exploration of the potential impact of use of statins or fibrates on variables at diagnosis. No data on dysplastic naevi, a marker of melanoma risk, was reported and studies may not have randomised the participants equally by the various risk factors for melanoma (e.g. dysplastic naevi).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The melanoma outcomes data collected by this study from randomised, controlled trials of statins or fibrates does not exclude the hypothesis that these drugs prevent melanoma. There was a 10% reduction in melanoma incidence for people on statins and a 42% reduction for those on fibrates, however these results were not statistically significant. Until further evidence is established, limiting exposure to ultraviolet radiation remains the most effective way to reduce the risk of melanoma.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>While this meta-analysis does not exclude the potential use of statins or fibrates in isolation for melanoma prevention, it does call for further exploration of the use of these drugs in melanoma therapy. Whether these drugs can inhibit metastasis or augment the effect of chemotherapeutic agents in advanced melanoma still merits further investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Collisson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collisson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grabacka-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grabacka 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleijfer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleijfer 2005</LINK>). This lack of evidence warrants further work assessing the role of statins and fibrates in melanoma.</P>
