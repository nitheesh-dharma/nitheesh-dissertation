<TITLE>Orientation and mobility training for people with low vision</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-14 11:33:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Progressive visual impairment often affects people as they age. Training is used to help people with low vision maintain travel independence, with new orientation and mobility skills to compensate for reduced visual information. Orientation is the ability to recognise one's position in relation to the environment, whereas mobility is the ability to move around safely and efficiently. Orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) training teaches people to use their remaining vision and other senses to get around. Canes and optical aids may also be used.</P>
<P>We found two small studies with a total of 63 people comparing O&amp;M training delivered by a trained volunteer to physical exercise. These studies did not show a difference between the two interventions, but they had little power to do so because of the small sample size and poor methodological quality. There were no adverse effects of O&amp;M training in these studies.</P>
<P>There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials on which type of O&amp;M training is better for people with low vision who have specific characteristics and needs.<BR/>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-04-14 10:04:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1950 to March 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2010), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE) (March 2010), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) (March 2010), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov).">http://clinicaltrials.gov)</A> (March 2010), ZETOC (March 2010) and the reference lists of retrieved articles.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-14 10:50:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Two small studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. They were consecutive phases of development of the same training curriculum and assessment tool. The intervention was administered by a volunteer on the basis of written and oral instruction. In both studies the randomisation technique was inadequate, being based on alternation, and masking was not achieved. Training had no effect in the first study but tended to be beneficial in the second but not to a statistically significant extent. Reasons for differences between studies may have been: the high scores obtained in the first study, suggestive of little need for training and small room for further improvement (a ceiling effect), and the refinement of the curriculum allowing better tailoring to patients' specific needs and characteristics, in the second study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-14 11:32:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The review found two small quasi-randomised trials with similar methods, comparing training to physical exercise and assessing O&amp;M physical performance by means of a volunteer or a professional, which were unable to demonstrate a difference. Therefore, there is little evidence on which type of O&amp;M training is better for people with low vision who have specific characteristics and needs. Orientation and mobility instructors and scientists should plan randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effectiveness of different types of O&amp;M training. A consensus is needed on the adoption of standard measurement instruments of mobility performance which are proven to be reliable and sensitive to the diverse mobility needs of people with low vision. For this purpose, questionnaires and performance-based tests may represent different tools that explore people with low vision's subjective experience or their objective functioning, respectively. In fact, it has to be observed that low vision rehabilitation research is increasingly shifting towards the use of quality of life questionnaires as an outcome measure, sometimes with the aim to study complex and multidisciplinary interventions including different types of education and support, of which O&amp;M can be a component. An example of this is an ongoing cluster RCT conducted by Zijlstra et al. in The Netherlands. This trial is designed to compare standardised O&amp;M training with usual O&amp;M care not only for its effectiveness, but also its applicability and acceptability. This study adopts validated questionnaires for patients' subjective assessment of performance during activities of daily living. As performance assessment does not need to be made by an O&amp;M trainer, this allows for masking of assessors and a patient-centred outcome measure. </P>

</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-04-14 11:45:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) has established criteria for low vision which are used in the International Classification of Diseases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Visual impairment is defined as a best-corrected visual acuity of less than 0.5 logMAR (Snellen 6/18 or 20/60) but equal to or better than 1.3 logMAR (3/60 or 20/400) in the better eye. Blindness is defined as a best-corrected visual acuity of less than 1.3 logMAR or a remaining central field of 20 degrees diameter. In the United States, legal blindness is defined as a visual acuity of 1.0 logMAR (6/60 or 20/200) or less in the better eye.</P>
<P>Blindness is one of the most common disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2003</LINK>). An estimated 40 million people were blind a decade ago, the time of the last accurate assessment. Among persons older than 40 years in 2002 in the USA, 937,000 were blind. Figures for both the developing world, where 90% of world blindness exists, and the developed world are expected to increase significantly during the next decades as the world's population ages.</P>
<P>Causes of blindness in the USA depend on race and ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004</LINK>). Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause in white people whereas cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes in Hispanic and black people. Treatable or preventable conditions are the most frequent causes of blindness in developing countries: infectious disease, nutritional deficiency, cataract and refractive error (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the most significant handicaps produced by visual impairment is the limit it imposes on the ability to travel independently (<LINK REF="REF-Golledge-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golledge 1991</LINK>). During travel we receive the majority of the information about our environment through our visual system (<LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK>). Many aspects of routine life may be affected by difficulty or inability to travel, such as opportunities to participate in social activities and to find or retain employment (<LINK REF="REF-Long-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1996</LINK>). Loss of vision may, therefore, have a major effect on the individual's overall quality of life, either directly or indirectly (<LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The SEE Project (<LINK REF="REF-West-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2002b</LINK>) showed that disability, defined as deficit in performance relative to a population, cannot be characterised on the basis of a single cut-off value of visual acuity. In fact, for most daily living tasks performance gradually declines with progressive visual loss. Moreover, given tasks require specific levels of visual function. In the SEE Project reading and face recognition were very demanding in terms of visual function as they were found to be impaired in most people with even mild visual loss (0.5 or less, Snellen 6/12 or 20/40). On the other hand, the mobility tasks considered in the study were affected in almost half of people when visual acuity approached 0.1 (Snellen 6/60 or 20/200) (<LINK REF="REF-West-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vision functions other than standard visual acuity may affect day-to-day functioning of older adults. In most eye diseases loss of contrast sensitivity and the extent of visual field damage are correlated with mobility impairment at least as much as is visual acuity (<LINK REF="REF-West-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2002b</LINK>). Loss of peripheral visual field is particularly prominent in people with retinitis pigmentosa, 80% of whom experienced mobility difficulty based on a questionnaire in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Geruschat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geruschat 1998</LINK>). Finally, environmental factors are critical to mobility tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Kuyk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyk 1996</LINK>). The ability of visually impaired persons to avoid obstacles is significantly impeded under mesopic (reduced) illumination. Object contrast and location are also factors determining success in avoiding obstacles on the travel path (<LINK REF="REF-Kuyk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyk 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-04-14 11:48:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Travel in the environment involves skills of orientation and mobility (O&amp;M). Orientation is the ability to recognise and establish position in relation to environment. Mobility is the physical ability to move in an orderly, efficient and safe manner through the environment (<LINK REF="REF-Novi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novi 1998</LINK>). To maintain travel independence it is essential for a visually impaired adult to learn new (O&amp;M) skills to be able to compensate for reduced visual information (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seybold-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seybold 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Orientation and mobility training aims to teach visually impaired people to ambulate and negotiate the environment safely and independently (<LINK REF="REF-Blasch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blasch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1998</LINK>). Instructors must prepare clients to manage various risks associated with everyday life (<LINK REF="REF-Banja-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banja 1994</LINK>), especially if they undertake independent travel in uncontrolled environments (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2000</LINK>). Through O&amp;M training, visually impaired individuals are taught to enhance their mobility performance by using their remaining vision and other senses, such as hearing and touch (<LINK REF="REF-Guth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaGrow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaGrow 1994</LINK>). The senses are supplemented by the use of devices such as long canes and support canes (<LINK REF="REF-LaGrow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaGrow 1994</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The use of a cane by people with visual impairment, as a device that can help them move about independently, was reported as long ago as in the Bible and in Greek mythology (<LINK REF="REF-Blasch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blasch 1995</LINK>). In 1872, Levy proposed a technique for moving a cane, known as 'the touch technique,' in an article that was reprinted in 1949 (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1949</LINK>). In 1946, Hoover proposed a modified technique in which the cane touches the ground in front of the trailing foot rather than the forward foot (<LINK REF="REF-Hoover-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoover 1946</LINK>). The aim is to touch where the next foot is to be placed, facilitating detection of holes, drop offs and other changes in levels of terrain. After World War II, increasing awareness of the potential of these techniques, together with the need to offer rehabilitation to young blind veterans, prompted most agencies to establish 'travel training' programs to incorporate this technique, even for people with usable residual vision. Optical aids including bioptic telescopes have been used in conjunction with O&amp;M training with the aim of improving central visual function (<LINK REF="REF-Corn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feinbloom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinbloom 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korb-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korb 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szlyk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Szlyk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szlyk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Szlyk 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-04-14 11:54:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Enhancing the ability of low vision people to safely navigate their home and the external environment is the aim of O&amp;M services. People are taught how to cope with vision loss to maximise the ability to live independently. Given the fact that O&amp;M training is an established practice, the most interesting question to people with low vision and O&amp;M therapists is which techniques are more effective.</P>
<P>Orientation and mobility training may be a component of multidisciplinary rehabilitation delivered by some low vision services. An ongoing Cochrane review focusses on such complex interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Langelaan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langelaan 2007</LINK>), and therefore these interventions will not be the purpose of our review. Another Cochrane review underway is currently investigating the effect of environmental and behavioural interventions for reducing activity limitation and improving quality of life in community dwelling visually impaired older people. Our review focusses on objective performance whilst the other two Cochrane reviews adopt quality of life as the primary outcome measure.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-12-13 18:32:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gianni Virgili">
<P>The Academy for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation and Education Professionals performed a survey among O&amp;M training specialists in order to evaluate the knowledge, skill and ability required in their profession (<LINK REF="REF-Wiener-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiener 2000</LINK>). This survey established a ranking of importance of professional competencies according to the opinion of 200 O&amp;M experts that responded to the questionnaire. However, current assessment and rehabilitation techniques are not standardised and to date there has not been a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of the various interventions used by O&amp;M training specialists.</P>

<P>1. Performance obtained in predetermined laboratory or real-world routes. This was considered as either the crude walking speed or as the percentage preferred walking speed (PPWS), defined as speed on the mobility course divided by preferred walking speed (<LINK REF="REF-Soong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK>).<BR/>2. Ability to use guide dogs during outdoor travel.<BR/>3. Social interaction, such as ability to meet relatives or friends at their homes or in public places; ability to live alone at home; the need for help from relatives or friends for travel-related daily tasks such as shopping.<BR/>4. Score obtained in quality of life questionnaires that measure psychological well-being and score in psychiatric questionnaires that evaluate depression.<BR/>5. Participants' perceptions of the effect of O&amp;M training on their lives relative to expectance, acceptance, satisfaction and impact in the short and in the long term.</P>
<P>Finally, O&amp;M training is not free of risk as increased mobility causes people to be exposed to potentially serious harm (<LINK REF="REF-Banja-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banja 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2000</LINK>).

These items were evaluated for each outcome measure or class of outcome measure as specified in the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook. As reported in the Handbook, other sources of bias were: risk of bias related to the specific study design used; or trial stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule); or an extreme baseline imbalance; or the study claimed to have been fraudulent.</P>
<P>If the information available in the published trial reports was inadequate to assess methodological quality, we contacted the trial authors for clarification. If they did not respond within a reasonable period of time, we assessed the trial based on the available information.</P>
<P>Each parameter was assessed as Yes (low risk of bias), No (high risk of bias) or Unclear.</P>

<P>In the updated version of this review, given further guidance available in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009a</LINK>), we considered that missing outcome data are not a problem if loss to follow-up is both balanced in the study arms and causes of loss to follow up are documented and judged to be unrelated to outcome in both study arms. When causes of missingness were not available, we planned to use Stata 10.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, Tx) user written function <I>metamiss </I>to take into account missing data and conduct sensitivity meta-analyses if sufficient studies were found.

<P>Although the same two studies were included in the current and in the previous version of this review, we decided to present results in meta-analyses in this version of the review mainly with the purpose of presenting results in the Summary of Findings table. This also reflected a change in perspective on heterogeneity, since it is difficult to investigate with few studies in the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009b</LINK>). The updated Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2009</LINK>) provides overlapping bands of I<SUP>2</SUP> values as categories of heterogeneity, which should be used considering the magnitude and direction of effects and heterogeneity Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P-value or I<SUP>2</SUP> confidence intervals. However, I<SUP>2</SUP> confidence intervals are typically very wide in many systematic reviews that include a few trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2007</LINK>), making it difficult to assess statistical heterogeneity. Thus we commented on differences between trials, also considering the P-value of the heterogeneity Chi<SUP>2</SUP> and the overlap of individual studies' confidence intervals. We also present 99% confidence intervals as found in RevMan since their coverage approaches a conservative Bonferroni approach that takes into account multiplicity of outcome measures in the two included studies (total score and three subscales) such as done in the previous version of this review. In fact 98.75% confidence intervals are obtained applying this method to four outcomes (P = 0.05 divided by four comparisons: P = 0.0125).</P>
<P>If more than three studies can be pooled in future updates of this review, we will follow the guidance given in the updated Handbook version (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2009</LINK>) and also consider I<SUP>2</SUP> 95% confidence interval calculated from the Q value given by RevMan and the appropriate degrees of freedom by means of the <I>heterogi</I> Stata software routine.</P>

<P>See '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table for further details. Both studies were conducted in the USA. They adopted similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, type of intervention and outcome measures since <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> was developed on the basis of <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> included 48 people aged 60 or over. They were legally blind participants who still maintained some degree of independent mobility but with indoor O&amp;M needs. Because this was a US-based study, legal blindness should have corresponded to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less bilaterally. To be included the participants must have had sufficient cognitive functioning to comprehend verbal communication. Thirteen persons were lost to follow up, mainly due to illness. There were 13 females and 22 males among the 35 people who completed the study (mean age was 76 years). Loss to follow up was balanced in the treatment and control groups since 18 versus 17 people completed the follow up respectively. Vision had been impaired for nine years on average and was mainly due to glaucoma. Of 35 people, 37% were totally blind and 40% had light perception only; only nine participants had some cognitive impairment. Nineteen people did not have balance problems and did not use devices such as canes; four had some balance problems; eight used a cane and four needed a wheelchair. People mostly resided in apartments in retirement complexes, single-dwelling family or nursing homes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> included 40 people with a minimum age of 58 years. People had to be functionally blind (not using vision for mobility), have indoor O&amp;M needs yet have some degree of independent mobility. Eight of them could not complete the study; illness being the main reason for this. Out of 32 participants who completed the program, 20 were male and 12 were female (mean age was 77 years); 50% were totally blind and 34% had light perception only; with visual impairment lasting from 12 years on average and mainly due to glaucoma. Fourteen people had some cognitive impairment. Eleven did not have balance problems and did not use devices such as canes; eight had some balance problems (frail), eight used a cane; one a walker and four needed a wheelchair. The most common housing was in a nursing home, followed by private home.</P>
<P>In both studies, the Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire was used to evaluate simple cognitive abilities (10 questions) of the participants. There is no mention in these studies about the level of independence at baseline when moving in the home. This could influence the effect of the intervention if sufficient skills have been acquired by most participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> the intervention consisted of a series of scripted lessons administered by a volunteer. The O&amp;M instruction programme was personalised according to the level of physical functioning of the participant, and specifically according to the type of device used. The volunteer received both written and oral instructions that enabled her or him to perform simple indoor O&amp;M techniques with the participant during one hour of orientation to the project. The volunteer-participant pairs worked on the program for 90 minutes a week for 10 to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Items included in a subscale were used both as a training framework and as an assessment tool and were:<BR/>1. Orientation skills subscale: sound localisation, concepts, landmarks, turns, tactual discrimination (hands and feet), systematic search patterns and dropped objects.<BR/>2. Mobility skills, independent subscale: motor balance, seating, stairs, trailing, diagonal cane, elevator, squaring off and straight line, self-protection positions.<BR/>3. Mobility skills, sighted guide subscale: basic position, narrow spaces, changing sides, doors, stairs.</P>
<P>Not all participants completed all items as this depended on their own characteristics and needs. The control group received programmed fitness exercises according to <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1984</LINK>.</P>
<P>The intervention delivered in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> was an evolution of that presented in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK>, which was modified to improve the applicability to the individual circumstances. To achieve this many sections of the programs were rearranged. In particular, an item corresponding to route travel within the living environment was added.</P>
<P>The reliability of the assessment instrument was assessed in both studies by an independent grader on a subset of participants. Crude agreement was reported to be high.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> used an assessment instrument administered by the volunteer and consisted of an Orientation scale and a Mobility scale. The Orientation and Mobility scales provided the outcome measures, recorded as the percentage of correct behaviours performed out of those possible for that participant. Therefore, the score ranged between 0 and 100, the latter being the higher score or the better performance. Not all activities could be performed by all participants and some scales were not delivered as they were inappropriate for certain participants. The scores were added to obtain a total score. There were two versions of the instrument: for people using, or not using, a device such as cane, walker or wheelchair.</P>
<P>The assessment instrument adopted in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> was developed on the basis of that used for <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK>. The main changes were the introduction of subjective assessment of the ability to complete four routes in order to rate the visually impaired person on safe and effective travel within the living environment. Furthermore, assessment was performed by a trained professional to try to improve its sensitivity.</P>
<P>In both studies, the skills on which the total score and the subscales were calculated could be classified as corresponding to the definition of the primary outcome measure considered for this review. In fact, the assessment instrument measured skills that were related to travel activities of daily life. The three subscales that were created by the authors represent different aspects of O&amp;M training. The Orientation scale includes skills related predominantly to the person's understanding of the information to interpret the environment, spatial relationships, and movement. The two Mobility scales depended primarily on the person's physical movements within the indoor living environment. The Independent subscale included skills that were necessary for autonomous travel, while skills in the Sighted Guide scale referred to the interaction with a seeing guiding person during travel.</P>
<P>The score was expressed as the percentage of behaviours performed out of the number of behaviours appropriate for that person (<LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK>).</P>

<P>The authors of the two included studies reported analyses of the total score (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) as well as analyses of three subscales (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Since this was a training and assessment instrument, grouping of similar skills in the subscales should have been pre-planned which would avoid the risk of "post hoc" analyses but as yet we have not had this confirmed by the authors. Since discussing statistical heterogeneity of two small studies is questionable, we provide a meta-analysis for descriptive purposes and discuss clinical heterogeneity issues.</P>
<P>An issue in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> was the good functioning of most individuals, either because they already had some independent mobility in their living environments, or because of the characteristics of the measurement tool (too easy for the people included). In fact, baseline scores were in general high, from 73 up to 95 in all scales, which may have limited the ability to detect an improvement (ceiling effect). The score was a percentage of tasks done correctly; high scores were markedly skewed when plotted as a continuous outcome variable. Taking into account these limitations, there was no statistically significant difference between groups in any score at the final examination (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>All baseline scores were much lower in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> (range: 47 to 70), suggestive of less O&amp;M skills in these people who had more room for improvement. At the final assessment, all the scores in the treated group increased, but the difference between comparison groups was close to statistical significance only for the Independent subscale (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The authors observed anecdotally that blind persons with no O&amp;M experience benefit more, while those living in their homes for years already had skills. Participants with less severe visual impairment did not have O&amp;M needs.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-07 14:54:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The two small quasi-randomised controlled studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK>) could not find a significant difference between O&amp;M training, delivered by a volunteer and physical exercise. <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> evaluated the effects of orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) training in adults with low vision, comparing it to physical exercise. The studies were consecutive phases of development and implementation of the same training curriculum and assessment instrument. No difference between O&amp;M training and physical exercise was found in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> O&amp;M training tended to be better than physical exercise, but only the difference for the independent subscale of the training/ assessment instrument was close to statistical significance. This scale assessed the ability to travel indoors independently.<BR/>The differences between the two studies may have been due to the improvement of the intervention and assessment instrument, which was developed to be tailored to a patient's needs and characteristics in the second study. An important limitation of <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> was the high baseline scores obtained by the participants, close to the maximum achievable with that instrument (ceiling effect). Another difference between these studies could be greater O&amp;M abilities of participants before training. Very low vision was slightly less common among participants in <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> as compared to <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> (77% versus 84%), and the authors observed that there is little need for O&amp;M training among those using vision for travel. Even differences among blind people may exist, since those who are very familiar with their home environment already have such skills, but no details are available in the articles.<BR/>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-04-07 14:56:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Given the complexity of O&amp;M interventions and the small size of the two studies in this review, as well as the fact that they were conducted by the same study group, we cannot assume that our findings are applicable to other settings. The precision obtained in each study is low since analysing data as standardised mean difference (i.e. the effect size) could not exclude a large effect size, i.e. approaching 1, based on 95% confidence interval limits.</P>
<P>From the researchers' point of view, these two studies suggest that it is possible to develop an O&amp;M training curriculum coupled with an assessment tool that is able to capture change with time for at least some O&amp;M skills. Nonetheless, this message can be less useful today, given the shift towards the use of quality of life questionnaires as an outcome measure and towards complex rehabilitation or support models as an intervention.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-04-14 14:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The size of the studies (which are small) and the inadequate method of randomisation place these studies at risk of selection bias and confounding. Masking of recipients of care and care providers could not be achieved and indeed this may be difficult or impossible when delivering an O&amp;M intervention. In at least one study the outcome assessors were not masked. On the other hand, the choice of outcome measures that allow masking of at least outcome assessors is important when scoring O&amp;M performance. The shift from objective to subjective outcomes, i.e. from scoring physical performance to self-perceived performance or quality of life measured with validated questionnaires, would change the perspective from that of the trainer to that of the patient, thus allowing masking of both assessors and a patient-centred outcome measure. Such a choice has been made in the ongoing study <LINK REF="STD-Zijlstra-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zijlstra 2009</LINK>. This study is validating a standardised O&amp;M training model in The Netherlands while assessing its acceptability and efficacy compared to standard care.</P>

<P>Since we found little literature that met the more stringent criteria for this review, we provided a description of three non-randomised controlled studies found by the electronic searches that have evaluated the effects of this intervention, to delineate the most recently used investigation methods.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Szlyk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Szlyk 1998</LINK> compared the performance of eight people who received both bioptic amorphic lenses and O&amp;M training with that of seven people who received neither, during an observation period of three months. All participants were affected by peripheral visual field loss and the aim of the lenses was to expand their visual field. No randomisation procedure was reported but the authors state that the participants were matched as much as possible for ocular disease, level of visual impairment and age. The group that served as a control in the first three months received the same intervention during the second trimester. All participants were evaluated with clinical, psychophysical, laboratory and O&amp;M assessment, which included driving skills, at baseline and at three and six months. A merit of this study is that the authors explored the feasibility of using a number of laboratory and real-world tests grouped in six fundamental visual skills that are relevant to O&amp;M (recognition, peripheral detection, scanning, tracking, visual memory and mobility). The authors provided examples of such tasks. Examples of recognition tasks were counting the number of people in a passing car; locating building addresses; reading posted prices of items within a cafeteria. As an index of mobility, participants were graded on their ability to cross intersections, walk stairs, and negotiate crowded public places. Scanning tasks included finding particular items on a store shelf, finding a particular entrance in the student union building, and locating the "deli station" in a cafeteria. Tracking tasks included watching moving vehicles as they pass down the street and following particular individuals in public places. The certified O&amp;M specialist coded performance on the mobility tests using a scale from 1 (not able to perform) to 5 (no difficulty). On each task, either performance or speed or both were coded. To define a trained person as improved in a particular task they had to obtain an increase in score of at least the average change recorded in the observation group after three months. With this definition, there was a reported 25% to almost 50% improvement of performance, depending on the type of task, after both immediate and delayed training. The investigators found that the amount of improvement was larger in those with narrower visual field. Data on reliability of the measures are not provided.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Szlyk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Szlyk 2000</LINK> used a similar battery of assessment methods and study design to evaluate the effectiveness of bioptic lenses with or without O&amp;M training in people with central vision loss. Participants were assigned to receive bioptic telescopes with training (n = 9), telescopes alone (n = 8) or no intervention (n = 8). This last group was offered delayed use of lenses and training from three to six months. No method of randomisation was used but the authors state that groups were matched and statistically equivalent in age, sex, central scotoma size, visual acuity and letter contrast sensitivity. As in the former study, the authors defined an improvement in a task as an increase in score by more than the average of the test-retest difference (baseline versus three months) for the untreated group. Since they found no difference between the improvement obtained with immediate versus delayed training, they combined data of those given lenses and training initially with those who received the intervention in the second trimester only; these individuals had served as controls in the first trimester. They found a statistically significant effect of training plus lenses compared to lenses alone for some visual tasks, such as recognition (P = 0.05, t-test), peripheral identification (P = 0.02), scanning (P = 0.03), but not for mobility (P = 0.06), tracking (P = 0.15) or visual memory (P = 0.07), although all comparisons favoured the intervention. When driving related tasks were evaluated separately from other O&amp;M tasks a statistically significant effect of training was observed for this task (P = 0.02). This work shows that differences between treatment groups can be elicited based on numerous and complex psychophysical, laboratory and real-world tests but statistical methods used to analyse them are not reported in detail in the paper. One statistical issue is the failure to take into account multiple testing, which increases the likelihood of finding a statistical significance by chance. As an example, performing 20 comparisons adopting the conventional level of statistical significance (P=0.05), leads to a probability of (1 to 0.95<SUP>20</SUP>) or 64% to obtain one or more significant findings only by chance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK> investigated the effect of O&amp;M training on mobility performance of 19 visually impaired individuals compared to 18 people who were matched as closely as possible for ocular disease, level of visual impairment and age. No randomisation procedure was adopted. All the participants were physically active and went out of their homes with or without other people. Sixteen people in the treated group were prescribed long canes or support canes or identity canes. All participants were tested at two visits four weeks apart. At each visit, the person's mobility performance was assessed twice as walking efficiency (Percentage Preferred Walking Speed (PPWS)) and error score on an indoor obstacle course. The error score improved at the second visit only in the treated group but not to a statistically significant extent, while PPWS improved only in the untrained group. The authors comment that the mental effort spent by trained participants trying to use the new techniques may have compromised their walking efficiency. Also the design of the walking path may be critical and future studies should consider other outcome measures such as self reported mobility performance and mental effort needed.<BR/>The studies presented above as well as the literature obtained in our search point out that trials considering O&amp;M training may use very different tests to measure participants' performance. The objective of our review was not to find and discuss all the studies that have used or evaluated O&amp;M assessment instruments. Nonetheless, we recognise that the discussion of this issue is critical for those who plan to conduct RCTs in this field of research. Therefore, we provide some examples that are useful for this purpose. <LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK> used an indoor laboratory course with obstacles set up along the course and measured time and errors made while completing the task. <LINK REF="STD-Szlyk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Szlyk 1998</LINK> used 41 indoor and outdoor tests exploring six visual skills categories (recognition, peripheral detection, scanning, tracking, visual memory and mobility). <LINK REF="REF-Geruschat-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geruschat 1989</LINK> used total time and mobility incidents on real-world routes. <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Straw-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Straw 1991b</LINK> developed an assessment instrument for assessing O&amp;M in older visually impaired adults, which has been described above and which they claimed to have acceptable inter-observer reliability.</P>
<P>The complexity of an O&amp;M intervention and its evaluation is such that assessment instruments will usually focus on several aspects of the performance rather than on a single objective measure. While objective measurements of performance have theoretically better properties, being easier to standardise, their use and interpretation may not be straightforward. As an example, <LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK> used PPWS and error score to evaluate mobility. They could not demonstrate a benefit from training with respect to the control group, although there was a trend in favour of treated people for the error score outcome.</P>
<P>The authors state that it may be necessary to assess mobility performance after a longer period, such as at three and six months after training, to allow visually impaired adults to have sufficient practice in adopting new travel skills. It must also be considered that O&amp;M instructors specifically teach clients to vary walking speed and to increase the duration of preview while walking through an unfamiliar area so that faster may not always be better for some real-world tasks. In addition, many of the participants in the training group used a long cane on the post-test, but not the pre-test. This may have further slowed their progress as they would have been relatively inexperienced with the cane and would have had to use it to manoeuvre round the confined and cluttered obstacle course that was being used to assess performance. This could explain the opposite direction of training effect on PPWS and error score in treated and control participants in the study by <LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK>. Even if such effects were demonstrated, how they relate to a person's quality of life is not clear. Indeed, if laboratory mobility tests are used they should both be sensitive to meaningful changes in performance and correlate with real-world tasks. An advantage of using laboratory tests is that they can be described in detail, as in <LINK REF="REF-Soong-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2001b</LINK>, and possibly replicated by others. Finally, tests arranged in a laboratory may not be comparable across studies because of differences in their construction, such as number and positioning of obstacles along the path, their characteristics or positioning of light and glare sources.</P>
<P>The training and assessment methods of the studies presented in this discussion indicate that, despite the apparent lack of standard measures of the effect of O&amp;M training, several travel-related activities which are relevant to a person's life should be considered as primary outcome measures and the training should also be personalised according to patients' needs and characteristics. It may also be expected that enhanced mobility will have an impact on a person's wellbeing and self-esteem and on their relationship with other people. Results from laboratory-based mobility tests can be considered as surrogate outcome measures as they are expected to relate to performance in daily life. Specifically designed quality of life questionnaires may also be suitable to measure the effect of O&amp;M intervention. The advantages of these tools are the ability to capture not only physical, but also mental and social dimensions of health using measures of both functionality and well-being based on self-evaluation. One example of such instruments is the Independent Mobility Questionnaire (IMQ), developed by Turano et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Turano-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turano 1999</LINK>) for people with retinitis pigmentosa. An overview on quality of life and other types of visual function assessment questionnaires is offered in <LINK REF="REF-Massof-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massof 2001</LINK>.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-04-14 15:07:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The clinical practice of O&amp;M instructors suggests that the need for mobility training of people with low vision is self evident. Nonetheless, the possibility of quantitative assessment of the effect of training is needed to study which techniques are more useful. Such results would help O&amp;M instructors choose the most appropriate techniques, as well as guiding social health programmes in deciding to support this intervention in an era of cost-containment.<BR/>Two small quasi-randomised controlled studies could not find a significant difference between O&amp;M training, delivered by a volunteer, and physical exercise.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-14 15:10:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>More research is needed on O&amp;M training for low vision adults. The complexity and diversity of patients' needs makes it necessary to adapt any training curriculum to individual patients' profiles, as pointed out by the authors of the studies retrieved in this review. The O&amp;M community should develop standard, yet flexible methods to objectively test O&amp;M performance which are valid and reliable. The complexity of the relationship between O&amp;M training and a person's experiences suggests that instruments that capture more fully subjective perceptions of health, such as questionnaires on quality of life that are specific to these tasks, could also be useful tools for assessing the outcome of O&amp;M training.</P>
<P>Finally, we report here a few key questions for future O&amp;M research which have been formulated in the discussion of the update of this review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>How much instruction is required before treatment effects are seen (dosage issue)?</LI>
<LI>How does the type and degree of vision loss affect the number of units of service that are required?</LI>
<LI>Of the various philosophies of care, which one is most effective?</LI>
<LI>What are the characteristics of subjects who benefit from the different philosophies of care?</LI>
<LI>What are the measures of mobility performance that are needed to assess the diverse needs of people with low vision?</LI>

<LI>We decided that it was of little interest to consider no training as the only comparator, and we included different types of O&amp;M training as control. In fact, our peer-reviewers pointed out that there is no point in assessing the efficacy of O&amp;M training in itself, given its established use and self-evident effect.</LI>

<P>The intervention consisted of a series of scripted lessons to be administered by a volunteer. The O&amp;M instruction programme was personalised according to the level of physical functioning of the participant, specifically according to the type of device used. The volunteer received both written and oral instruction that enabled her/him to perform with the participant simple indoor O&amp;M techniques during one hour of orientation to the project. The fields of instruction corresponded to the activities described in the Outcomes section. The volunteer-participant pairs worked on the program for 90 minutes a week for 10 to 12 weeks.</P>

<P>A parallel group randomised controlled trial developed to evaluate a standardised O&amp;M training in the use of an identification cane (NCT00946062). The trial is conducted in collaboration with the two main organisations for low vision rehabilitation care in The Netherlands: Bartimus and the VisioSensisDeBrink Group (as of January 2010: Royal Visio).</P>
</CHAR_STUDY_NAME>
<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-04-14 15:48:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Cluster randomised trial. In 18 local centres, which are scattered over The Netherlands, O&amp;M training is provided to older persons with visual impairment. The centres were randomly allocated to the control group or intervention group stratified by organisation (at that time: Bartimus &#8211; four local centres, Sensis &#8211; four local centres, and Visio &#8211; 10 local centres). Due to the nature of the trial and the information provided to clients before the start of the trial (required by the Medical Ethical Committee), mobility trainers, researchers and participants are not masked to intervention status. Participants are, however, not informed about their intervention status until the start of the O&amp;M training. Trained outcome assessors who perform the interviews by telephone are masked to intervention status.</P>
<P>Data for the effect evaluation are collected at baseline, and at five and 17 weeks after the start of the O&amp;M training during 40 minute interviews by telephone. Trained interviewers, who are masked to group allocation, perform the interviews. In addition, a 25 minute interview by telephone is performed at eight weeks after the start of the O&amp;M training to obtain data for the process evaluation from participants in the intervention group as well as the control group. Pre-structured questionnaires on process aspects are used to gather data from the mobility trainers per participant. Trainers receive this questionnaire before the first session of the participant's O&amp;M training. As recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>, non-compliant participants are approached for all follow-up assessments.</P>

<P>Community-dwelling older people who ask for support at a rehabilitation centre for people with visual impairment and who are likely to receive an O&amp;M training in using the identification cane are included in the trial (N = 190).</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-14 15:44:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The standardised O&amp;M training aims to facilitate safe and independent participation in the community by optimal use of one's abilities, and to facilitate uptake of old or new activities. To achieve these aims several strategies were added to the regular O&amp;M training, that is: prioritising the client's needs, cognitive restructuring, action planning, contracting, providing direct feedback and stimulating individual problem solving, and finding personal, realistic solutions. The standardised O&amp;M training consists of two face-to-face sessions and one telephone session. Compared to the regular O&amp;M training, the standardised O&amp;M training is well structured, yet still tailor made as clients are actively involved in their rehabilitation with respect to mobility. For example, they are encouraged to individualise their training by means of formulating personal goals regarding activities in the community. Trainers were instructed to provide additional O&amp;M training sessions to the clients if needed. Trainers providing care according to the standardised O&amp;M training needed to complete both the two face-to-face sessions and the one telephone session before conducting extra training sessions on O&amp;M.</P>
<P>Trainers who would provide the standardised O&amp;M training to the intervention group received a two hour instruction by the researcher (GZ). To prepare for the instruction, trainers read the manual of the standardised O&amp;M training.</P>
<P>To monitor whether participants received sufficient care, trainers answered two questions as part of the process evaluation. These questions included to what extent the O&amp;M training met the participant's need for mobility support according to the perception of the trainer and whether additional training sessions in the use of the identification cane were needed.</P>

Secondary outcomes include quality of life, feelings of anxiety, symptoms of depression, fear of falling, and falls history.
