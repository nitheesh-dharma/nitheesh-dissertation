<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Cochrane review authors investigated different regimens used for preparing the uterus (womb) for transferring frozen-thawed embryos to the uterus in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) to become pregnant.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In subfertile women undergoing ART, eggs are collected from the ovaries and fertilised by sperm in a laboratory (in vitro fertilisation or IVF). Some or all embryos may be frozen, to be thawed and transferred to the womb at a later stage. This is called frozen-thawed embryo transfer (or FET).</P>
<P>Women with regular spontaneous periods (menstrual cycles) may be offered a range of cycle regimens to prepare the womb lining for FET. Alternatively, FET can be carried out after spontaneous ovulation (release of an egg) in a natural cycle. This is called natural cycle FET.</P>
<P>Women with irregular cycles are either not ovulating or are ovulating randomly. Therefore, natural cycle FET is not suitable for them. These women can be offered either ovulation induction with fertility drugs or hormone therapy (HT) to prepare them for FET.</P>
<P>The most common regimens for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG (human chorionic gonadrotophin) trigger, or endometrial preparation with HT with or without a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to temporarily suppress ovarian function.</P>
<P>We conducted this review to find out if a particular FET regimen is more effective or safer than others. Our main outcomes were live birth rates and miscarriage rates per woman.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 18 randomized controlled trials with 3815 women. The trials were conducted in Belgium, France, Israel, Italy, Iran, Singapore, the Netherlands and the UK. The evidence is current to 2 December 2016.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of one cycle regimen in preference to another in preparation for FET in subfertile women with regular ovulatory cycles. The most common modalities for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG trigger or endometrial preparation with HT, with or without GnRHa suppression. We identified only four direct comparisons of these two modalities and there was insufficient evidence to support the use of either one in preference to the other. We found no evidence specific to non-ovulatory women.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was of low or very low quality. The main limitations were failure to report important clinical outcomes, poor reporting of study methods and unclear findings due to lack of data.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-28 03:53:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among subfertile couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), pregnancy rates following frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) treatment cycles have historically been found to be lower than following embryo transfer undertaken two to five days following oocyte retrieval. Nevertheless, FET increases the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduces cost, is relatively simple to undertake and can be accomplished in a shorter time period than repeated in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles with fresh embryo transfer. FET is performed using different cycle regimens: spontaneous ovulatory (natural) cycles; cycles in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by oestrogen and progesterone hormones, commonly known as hormone therapy (HT) FET cycles; and cycles in which ovulation is induced by drugs (ovulation induction FET cycles). HT can be used with or without a gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). This is an update of a Cochrane review; the first version was published in 2008.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-18 04:43:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>For subfertile couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), embryo transfer can be performed with either fresh or frozen-thawed embryos. Pregnancy rates following frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) treatment cycles have historically been found to be lower than following fresh embryo transfer.

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-29 13:27:04 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>FET has been carried out using a variety of cycle regimens; spontaneous ovulatory cycles (natural cycle), cycles in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by oestrogen and progesterone hormones and is called hormone therapy (HT) cycle, and cycles in which ovulation is induced by drugs (ovulation induction cycle).</P>
<P>For FET to be successful the age of the embryos after thawing has to be synchronised with the age of the endometrium on the day of embryo transfer. Thus, endometrial receptivity and synchronisation between embryonic and endometrial development are important factors in the process of embryo implantation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural cycle</HEADING>
<P>Performing FET in a monitored natural cycle has the advantage that no medications are used, making such cycles preferable to many women. It is only feasible for women with regular ovulatory cycles, however, even in women with regular menstrual cycles, ovulation may not always occur and the timing of FET can also be problematic. Monitoring of the cycle requires several pelvic ultrasound scans to confirm follicular development and to time the commencement of urine testing for detection of the luteinising hormone (LH) surge. In addition, a further scan for ultrasonic evidence of ovulation may be required. Spontaneous endometrial development in the follicular phase is affected by age, and this may be a contributing factor in the lower pregnancy rate in older women (<LINK REF="REF-Sher-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sher 1991</LINK>). To avoid some of these problems, ovulation induction agents, such as tamoxifen, clomiphene citrate, gonadotrophins or a combination of clomiphene and gonadotrophins have been employed (<LINK REF="REF-Mandelbaum-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandelbaum 1987</LINK>). However, even with their use, cycle cancellation rates can be high.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hormone therapy cycle (with or without gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist)</HEADING>
<P>An alternative method for establishing an endometrium receptive to implantation is an artificial, hormonally-controlled cycle (HT) using sequentially administered exogenous oestrogen and progesterone. Such a regimen was first used in women without ovarian function receiving embryos derived from donor oocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Lutjen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutjen 1984</LINK>). In women with remaining ovarian function, a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) was used to temporarily suppress ovarian function and render the woman functionally agonadal prior to inducing an artificial cycle with oestrogen and progesterone. Using such a regimen, implantation and pregnancy rates in donor oocyte recipients with retained ovarian function were similar to those in recipients without ovarian function (<LINK REF="REF-Borini-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borini 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flamigni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flamigni 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pados-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pados 1992</LINK>). However, these cycles are more expensive, and the GnRHa can have adverse effects and delay the resumption of spontaneous ovulation if FET fails. A simplified regimen, retaining the benefits but reducing cost and adverse effects and consisting of exogenous oestrogen and progesterone only (without a GnRHa), has also been used in women with remaining ovarian function (<LINK REF="STD-Jaroudi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jaroudi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lelaidier-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lelaidier 1992</LINK>). With this approach, the initiation of orally administered exogenous oestrogen on day one of the cycle prevents follicular recruitment by suppressing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and consequently spontaneous ovulation is avoided. Estradiol implants have also been shown to suppress the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis resulting in adequate endometrial preparation in women with retained ovarian function (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Nun-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Nun 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The advantage of hormone regimens is a high level of control and flexibility in the timing of transfer. The length of the follicular phase can be varied without detriment to implantation or pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Leeton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeton 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navot-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navot 1989</LINK>), and the cycle cancellation rate is low. However, cost is greater, particularly if a GnRHa is used. Fixed regimens of oestrogen and progesterone may be inadequate for proper endometrial development in certain circumstances. In women with functioning ovaries, the possibility has been expressed that stimulatory factors of embryonic origin (such as human chorionic gonadotrophins) could lead to the production of ovarian substances (e.g. androgens or certain peptides) with an effect on endometrial quality. If a pregnancy occurs, oestrogen and progesterone must be continued until placental autonomy is established to replace the absent corpus luteum.</P>
<P>Most artificial cycle protocols mimic the natural cycle, but the active substances used and routes of delivery of oestrogen and progesterone vary. Oestrogen may be administered in the form of oral tablets, transdermal patches, subcutaneous implants and vaginal rings or tablets. Progesterone may be given in the form of oral tablets, intramuscular injections and intravaginal suppositories or rings (<LINK REF="REF-Devroey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devroey 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ovulation induction cycle</HEADING>
<P>Theoretically, ovulation induction can be offered to women with irregular or anovulatory cycles undergoing FET. The possible advantage is to induce ovulation with natural LH surge and semi-natural endometrial development. The development of a corpus luteum with production of natural oestrogen and progesterone helps support the luteal phase and early pregnancy without the need of exogenous HT. The use of clomiphene can be associated with an anti-oestrogenic effect on the endometrium. Other ovulation induction agents include oral anti-oestrogens such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole. Drawbacks of ovulation induction cycles include drug exposure and its possible adverse effects, and risks including high cancellation rate due to under or over response, the cost of gonadotrophins, the need for intense monitoring and the limited flexibility in connection with FET timing. For these reasons and in the absence of evidence supporting any benefit compared to other cycle regimens, most centres do not use ovulation induction.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-16 01:48:10 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All methods of endometrial preparation aim to achieve a state of the endometrium that will be receptive to replaced frozen-thawed embryos. The natural ovulatory cycle is the most physiological method. Using oestrogen and progesterone preparations as HT aims to prepare the endometrium in two stages. The first phase is using oestrogen preparations mimicking the follicular phase of a natural cycle. Following that progesterone preparations are added to oestrogen to mimic the luteal phase. Another method is the use of clomiphene tablets or human menopausal gonadotrophins (HMG) to induce ovulation and build up the endometrium.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-30 09:01:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early studies reported pregnancy rates in artificial cycles to be equivalent to those obtained after FET in spontaneous ovulatory cycles, with low cancellation rates (<LINK REF="STD-de-Ziegler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">de Ziegler 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frydman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frydman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meldrum-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meldrum 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Troup-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troup 1991</LINK>). Some subsequent studies (often containing small numbers) reported better outcomes in artificial than in natural cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mausher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mausher 1991</LINK>), while others found no difference (<LINK REF="REF-Irianni-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irianni 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sathanandan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sathanandan 1991</LINK>). However, concern about the adequacy of the various replacement regimens and the possibility of higher rates of early pregnancy loss has also been expressed (<LINK REF="STD-Lelaidier-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lelaidier 1992</LINK>). Therefore, uncertainty remains as to which type of cycle regimen is superior and many fertility clinics use a mixture of protocols for FET. The clinical effectiveness of the different approaches can only be determined by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the three cycle regimens (natural, HT and ovulation induction).</P>
<P>This review aimed to compare the outcome of FET in an artificial HT cycle or an ovulation-induction cycle with that of a monitored, natural cycle. The findings may be of interest to subfertile couples embarking on ART treatment, as well as practitioners and healthcare providers offering ART. This is the first update of a review first published in 2008, which included seven RCTs (1120 women) and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of one intervention in preference to another (<LINK REF="REF-Ghobara-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghobara 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Additional outcomes not appropriate for statistical pooling</HEADING>
<P>Data per cycle or per transfer are not appropriate for pooling, because of what statisticians refer to as 'unit of analysis errors'. Simple group comparison tests for categorical data require that observations are statistically independent. The use of multiple observations per participant leads to unpredictable bias in the estimate of treatment difference (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). Where we were unable to obtain per-woman data for any of our outcomes of interest with multiple cycles or transfers per woman, we reported data in an additional table.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to assess: selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data); reporting (selective reporting); and other bias such as difference in participants' baseline characteristics, embryo quality, participants' number of visits and number of days until LH-HCG surge (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).

<P>We took care to search for within-trial selective reporting, such as trials failing to report obvious outcomes, or reporting them in insufficient detail to allow inclusion. We sought published protocols where possible and compared the outcomes between the protocol and the final published study. Where identified studies failed to report any of the primary outcomes (e.g. live birth), but did report interim outcomes, we undertook informal assessment by comparing the interim values to those reported in studies that also reported the primary outcomes to detect whether there were any similarities between them.</P>

<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. live birth rates), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR). For continuous data (e.g. endometrial thickness), where studies reported exactly the same outcomes we calculated mean differences (MDs) between treatment groups. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes. We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies with how they are presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>

<P>The primary analysis was per woman randomized. We briefly summarized data that did not allow valid analysis (e.g. 'per cycle' data), entered them in additional tables and did not use them in meta-analyses. We counted multiple live births (e.g. twins or triplets) as one live birth event. We planned to include only first-phase data from cross-over trials. However, we included no cross-over trial in this review.</P>
<P>Where studies reported only 'per cycle' or 'per embryo transfer' data and there were multiple cycles or transfers per woman, we contacted authors of such studies and requested data 'per woman'.

<P>We found 18 RCTs with 3815 participating women. The largest study included 959 women. The mean number of women per trial was 164 (range 60 to 959). Therefore, findings from this review should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number and small size of available RCTs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural cycle FET comparisons</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in live birth, miscarriage or multiple pregnancy rates between women in natural cycle and women undergoing other FET regimens (HT with GnRHa suppression or natural cycle plus HCG trigger). However, women in natural cycle had a marginally higher ongoing pregnancy rate than women who had natural cycle with HCG trigger. This might be attributed to administration of HCG in late follicular phase, which induces a cascade of events in the endometrium and a rise in endogenous luteinising hormone (LH). These events might have a negative impact on implantation and ultimately on ongoing pregnancy rates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Modified natural cycle FET comparisons</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of live birth, miscarriage, or ongoing pregnancy between women in modified natural cycle and those undergoing HT FET or HT with GnRHa suppression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">HT FET comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Hormonally prepared (HT) FET cycles combined with GnRHa suppression resulted in higher live birth rates compared with FET cycles prepared with HT alone, but there was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage or ongoing pregnancy rates. The difference in live births may be attributed to a premature rise in LH levels that may occur in women with functioning ovaries not suppressed by a GnRHa. This rise in LH was reported even with no observed follicular recruitment (<LINK REF="REF-de-Ziegler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Ziegler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speroff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 1994</LINK>). LH is known to affect endometrial development through its effect on oestrogen and progesterone production but there has also been evidence to suggest that LH promotes localised synthesis of oestrogen and progesterone in the endometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Ku-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ku 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shemesh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shemesh 2001</LINK>). This premature LH rise may interfere with endometrial development and may hinder embryo implantation or it may cause suboptimal embryo implantation.</P>
<P>The review authors acknowledge the difficulty in combining studies in meta-analyses in the comparison HT versus HT plus GnRHa suppression. One study used a fixed-dose oestrogen preparation for both groups (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Toukhy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El-Toukhy 2004</LINK>), while in two studies the starting dose of oestrogen was lower in the HT-plus-GnRHa group compared to the HT-alone group (<LINK REF="STD-Dal-Prato-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Prato 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1998</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Toukhy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El-Toukhy 2004</LINK> study may have accounted for the presence of significant heterogeneity observed in one of the outcome measures, that is, endometrial thickness (MD -0.16 mm, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.09, 3 RCTs, n = 625, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 79%) (Analysis 18.6).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons of subtypes of ovulation-induction FET</HEADING>
<P>We identified two subtypes of FET comparisons: HMG versus clomiphene plus HMG; and HT plus GnRHa versus clomiphene. However, there were no per-woman clinical outcomes reported for HT plus GnRHa versus clomiphene. Women treated with HMG alone reported higher live birth rates compared with those who received clomiphene combined with HMG (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Auwera-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Auwera 1994</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference in either miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates</P>
<P>In current practice, most centres use natural cycle or use GnRHa suppression in conjunction with HT for FET. Clomiphene has an anti-oestrogenic effect on the endometrium leading to suboptimal endometrial development, therefore few centres, if any, are using it for ovulation induction cycle FET. It is highly unlikely that there will be future studies comparing clomiphene with HT only cycles.<BR/>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-16 22:35:44 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included only 18 RCTs and 3815 women. The included studies did not investigate some of our comparisons in full. In some of those that were investigated, data were either not available on some important outcome measures or were reported in non-usable forms. The majority of the investigated comparisons were in single, small trials. The largest number of participants that could be combined in this review related to the comparison of HT versus HT plus GnRHa (six RCTs, n = 991). Thus, in most of the comparisons, we could not combine data in meta-analyses for some outcome measures, resulting in effect estimates with wide CIs. In addition, most of the included studies were not adequately powered to detect any significant difference in treatment effects between the various treatment groups. In addition, the majority of the trials included women with regular ovulatory cycles with no information on women with anovulatory cycles In all, the body of current identified evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the superiority of one cycle regimen over another in preparation for FET.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-30 09:01:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low. The main limitations were failure to report important clinical outcomes, poor reporting of study methods and lack of precision due to low event rates.</P>
<P>The quality of fertility trials has been criticised repeatedly. One of the areas of particular concern is what statisticians refer to as the 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). It is methodologically incorrect to report data per cycle when it is women or couples who are randomized because many of the women will have undergone more than one treatment cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Dias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dias 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). However, pregnancy rate per cycle is a commonly reported outcome in fertility trials and reviews.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-30 09:01:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To prevent selection bias, two review authors independently assessed the included studies. The review was undertaken using its protocol as a guide to minimise bias as much as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Ghobara-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghobara 2002</LINK>). For meta-analysis, the unit of analysis was 'per woman randomized' resulting in the exclusion of outcomes reported in 'per-cycle'. As a result, the analyses are statistically less biased although a selection bias may have occurred.</P>
<P>We conducted a comprehensive search for eligible studies so as to minimise the effect of publication bias. However, we could not construct funnel plots for any comparisons thereby making it difficult to detect the presence of publication bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-16 22:47:45 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Findings from the current and previous versions of the review were essentially similar and substantially in agreement with each other (see <LINK REF="REF-Ghobara-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghobara 2008</LINK> for previous version of the review).</P>
<P>In nine non-randomised controlled studies, there was no evidence of a difference in either clinical or multiple pregnancy rates between women who had natural cycle FET and women who had HT FET (<LINK REF="STD-Belaisch_x002d_Allart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Belaisch-Allart 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Givens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Givens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kawamura 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oehninger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oehninger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pattinson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pattinson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yishai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yishai 2001</LINK>). These findings are in agreement with those of this review. In contrast, however, results of three retrospective studies comparing these two regimens showed higher pregnancy rates in the natural-cycle group (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morozov-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Morozov 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found one quasi-randomised study involving 162 cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Sathanandan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sathanandan 1991</LINK>) and five non-randomised controlled studies assessing natural-cycle FET versus HT plus GnRHa suppression (149 cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Shawaf-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Shawaf 1993</LINK>), 419 cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2007</LINK>), 417 cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Gelbaya-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gelbaya 2006</LINK>), 512 cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Queenan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Queenan 1994</LINK>), 125 cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Wada-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wada 1992</LINK>)). There were no differences in live birth or clinical pregnancy rates in any of these studies. Again, these findings are in agreement with those of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-19 21:34:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review did not find evidence to support the use of one cycle regimen in preference to another in preparation for frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) in women with regular ovulatory cycles. The most common modalities for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG trigger or endometrial preparation with hormone therapy (HT), with or without gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression. We identified only four direct comparisons of these two modalities and there was insufficient evidence in this review to support the use of either of these interventions in preference to the other. One small study compared clomiphene plus human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) with HMG; however, the evidence was of very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. We found no data specific to non-ovulatory women.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-30 09:01:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are few and insufficient randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the different methods of endometrial preparation prior to FET. There is a continuing need to design and conduct adequately powered RCTs. Researchers should ensure adherence to a clear randomization method and sound allocation concealment measures. An intention-to-treat analysis should be employed. The outcome measures should be expressed 'per woman' rather than per cycle. In the reporting of studies' results, the absolute figures should be included in addition to percentages. The follow-up period should be of sufficient duration to enable reporting on live birth rates. Because of the relative complexity and cost of ovulation induction cycles, future RCTs should focus on further evaluation of the simpler or cheaper (or both) natural-cycle FET and the HT cycle regimens. Future research should address the possible use of GnRHa to suppress luteinising hormone release in FET cycles and to compare its use with GnRHa HT FET cycles. The role of the relatively newer oral ovulation induction agents, such as aromatase inhibitors in FET cycles, needs to be evaluated in well-conducted RCTs.</P>
