<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:15:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>The abdominal aorta is a major blood vessel in the body that carries blood from the heart to the major organs in the chest and abdomen. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a balloon-like bulge (dilation) of the aorta that is greater than 3 cm in diameter. If an AAA ruptures (bursts), this is often fatal. Hence, AAAs that are larger than 5.5 cm are usually treated surgically in order to try to prevent such a rupture. Traditionally, AAAs are treated using an open surgical repair (OSR) technique, in which the abdomen is cut open (referred to as open surgery) and the dilated aorta is repaired using fabric graft material. However, over the past 20 years, a newer, 'key hole' technique has been used, in which the AAA is repaired without the need for open surgery - a thin tube is passed via the blood vessels in the groin to the site of the AAA. Once in the correct position, a sheath is introduced that acts to reline the dilated aorta, acting as an artifical blood vessel through which blood can continue to flow, bypassing the aneurysm. Hence, the risk of further expansion or rupture of the AAA is reduced, This technique is referred to as endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). As EVAR is a less invasive technique than OSR, in that there is no need for open surgery, it may have advantages over OSR. In addition, some individuals with other medical illnesses, for whom open surgery may be considered a high-risk procedure and who are not fit for OSR, can be offered EVAR instead.</P>
<P>The review authors identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of good quality that compared OSR with EVAR, involving a combined total of 2790 participants considered fit for surgery, and one RCT of good quality that compared EVAR with no intervention, involving a total of 404 participants considered unfit for OSR.</P>
<P>The pooled analysis of the four trials comparing OSR with EVAR showed that the death rates within 30 days of operation or during admission for surgery were significantly lower in individuals undergoing EVAR than in those undergoing OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%). However, there was no difference in death rates between the groups up to four years after the operation (intermediate follow up) or beyond four years (long-term follow up). Participants undergoing EVAR had a significantly higher incidence of a need for an additional intervention to deal with any complications of the procedure undertaken compared with those receiving OSR. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the two procedures. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of lung complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group. The results of the one RCT comparing EVAR with no intervention in individuals considered unfit for OSR showed no difference in overall death rates and complication rates between the groups.</P>

<P>An abnormal dilatation of the abdominal aorta is referred to as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Due to the risk of rupture, surgical repair is offered electively to individuals with aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm in size. Traditionally, conventional open surgical repair (OSR) was considered the first choice approach. However, over the past two decades endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has gained popularity as a treatment option. This article intends to review the role of EVAR in the management of elective AAA.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (January 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12).

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharath C V  Paravastu">
<P>Three reviewers independently evaluated trials for appropriateness for inclusion and extracted data using pro forma designed by the Cochrane PVD Group. We assessed the quality of trials using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We entered collected data in to Review Manager (version 5.2.3) for analysis. Where direct comparisons could be made, we determined odds ratios (OR). We tested studies for heterogeneity and, when present, we used a random-effects model; otherwise we used a fixed-effect model. We tabulated data that could not be collated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharath C V  Paravastu">
<P>Four high-quality trials comparing EVAR with OSR (n = 2790) and one high-quality trial comparing EVAR with no intervention (n = 404) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In individuals considered fit for surgery, a pooled analysis, including 1362 individuals randomised to EVAR and 1361 randomised to OSR, found short-term mortality (including 30-day or inhospital mortality, excluding deaths prior to intervention) with EVAR to be significantly lower than with OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%, OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.55; P &lt; 0.0001). Using intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) there was no significant difference in mortality at intermediate follow-up (up to four years from randomisation), with 221 (15.8%) and 237 (17%) deaths in the EVAR (n = 1393) and OSR (n = 1390) groups, respectively (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; P = 0.40). There was also no significant difference in long-term mortality (beyond four years), with 464 (37.3%) deaths in the EVAR and 470 (37.8%) deaths in the OSR group (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; P = 0.78). Similarly, there was no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality between groups, either at the intermediate- or long-term follow up.</P>
<P>Studies showed that both EVAR and OSR were associated with similar incidences of cardiac deaths (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; P = 0.36) and fatal stroke rate (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55; P = 0.52). The long-term reintervention rate was significantly higher in the EVAR group than in the OSR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 85%). Results of the reintervention analysis should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the EVAR and OSR groups. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group compared with the EVAR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006).</P>
<P>In individuals considered unfit for conventional OSR, the one included trial found no difference between the EVAR and no-intervention groups with regard to all-cause mortality at final follow up, with 21.0 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 22.1 deaths per 100 person years in the no-intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with EVAR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; P = 0.97). Aneurysm-related deaths were, however, significantly higher in the no-intervention group than in the EVAR group (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89; P = 0.02). There was no difference in myocardial events (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91) between the groups in this study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharath C V  Paravastu">
<P>In individuals considered fit for conventional surgery, EVAR was associated with lower short-term mortality than OSR. However, this benefit from EVAR did not persist at the intermediate- and long-term follow ups. Individuals undergoing EVAR had a higher reintervention rate than those undergoing OSR. Most of the reinterventions undertaken following EVAR, however, were catheter-based interventions associated with low mortality. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between EVAR and OSR. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group.</P>
<P>In individuals considered unfit for open surgery, the results of a single trial found no overall short- or long-term benefits of EVAR over no intervention with regard to all-cause mortality, but individuals may differ and individual preferences should always be taken into account.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:15:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When the main artery in the body, the aorta, develops a balloon-like bulge, an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is said to have developed. The prevalence of AAA (where the aortic diameter exceeds 3 cm) in the UK has been estimated at between 1.2% and 7.6% in populations over 50 years of age, depending on the criteria used to define the AAA (<LINK REF="REF-Khoo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khoo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>). As with most vascular diseases, the prevalence of AAA increases with age and occurs much more frequently in men than in women. In England, treatment of AAA accounts for approximately 3650 elective surgical procedures and 1100 emergency surgical procedures per year (<LINK REF="REF-Holt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Untreated AAAs are likely to increase in size and may eventually rupture, which can lead to death. The decision to repair an AAA is made on an individual basis, balancing the risk of treatment against the risk of aneurysm rupture. There is good evidence that the risk of rupture is related to aneurysm size; hence, whether treatment is necessary or not is generally based on the size of the AAA or the presence of symptoms.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Conventional surgical repair of AAA has been practiced since the early 1950s and involves the surgical insertion of a prosthetic (i.e. man-made) graft. This operation is referred to as open surgical repair (OSR) as it involves a large abdominal incision, and is associated with a significant risk of complications even when individuals are otherwise fit and well. The UK Small Aneurysm Trial found that aneurysms less than 5.5 cm in diameter can be kept under observation using periodic ultrasound scanning, reserving surgical intervention for those that become larger than 5.5 cm or that produce symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-UKSAT-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKSAT 1998</LINK>). The 30-day mortality associated with surgical repair of AAA in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial was 5.8%, and reported rates range from 2% to 7% in otherwise fit individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Feinglass-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinglass 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mutirangura-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutirangura 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steyerberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steyerberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takolander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takolander 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zarins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarins 1997</LINK>). However, if rupture occurs, mortality rises steeply. Inhospital mortality rates are reported to range from 40% to 80%, but as many cases do not reach hospital it is estimated that overall mortality is higher and may reach 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Bengtsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bengtsson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Budd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budd 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eskandari-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eskandari 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingoldby-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingoldby 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantonen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantonen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>In individuals who have severe coexistent cardiac, respiratory or renal disease, conventional surgical treatment may be considered too dangerous, and individuals considered unfit for surgery may not be offered OSR. In such cases, attempts may be made to lower the risk of rupture by reducing blood pressure or via other pharmacological manipulations, though there is no strong trial evidence that this is effective (<LINK REF="REF-Gadowski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadowski 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The traditional approach to treating individuals with AAA has been challenged by the arrival of a new, minimally invasive technique: endovascular stent grafting of AAA, known as endovascular aneurysm repair, or EVAR. This technique, first described by Parodi in 1991, involves the placement of a tubular graft within the aneurysm sac (bulge), which is anchored in place using metallic stents (<LINK REF="REF-Parodi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parodi 1991</LINK>). The aim is to exclude the aneurysm from within, thus preventing further expansion and rupture. The procedure is currently performed via arteriotomies (small holes in an artery to permit access) made in the groin arteries (usually the femoral arteries), using catheters and guidewires, and imaging with arteriography to position the stent-graft device at the site of the aneurysm. Regional, rather than general, anaesthesia can be used, particularly in individuals for whom general anaesthesia is a relative contraindication.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>There has been much development of these stent-grafts in recent years and there are three main configurations of grafts available for use: tube grafts, aorto-bi-iliac grafts and aorto-uni-iliac grafts. Choice of graft configuration depends on operator experience and the anatomical type of aneurysm to be treated. The aortic tube graft is no longer used because it is unusual for there to be sufficient normal aorta below the infrarenal AAA to which to anchor the lower end of the stent-graft. In addition, the distal aorta tends to enlarge with these stent-grafts over time, resulting in the return of blood flow into the aneurysm sac (endoleak) at the distal fixation site. The aorto-bi-iliac device is the most commonly used device and is most readily available worldwide. The aorto-uni-iliac graft configuration involves the person with AAA having a cross-over graft to maintain perfusion to both lower limbs. This configuration has the advantage that it can treat a large proportion of aneurysms, but currently it is suitable for use with only approximately 60% of all AAAs (<LINK REF="REF-Armon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armon 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most grafts now in use are commercially produced, either custom made for individuals, or coming in a range of sizes so that a suitable device can be obtained 'off the shelf'. The majority of commercially produced devices are of the aorto-bi-iliac configuration, although aorto-uni-iliac devices can be produced as custom-made devices on an individual basis, if required. Previously, some centres used improvised devices constructed from available graft materials and endovascular stents; these were usually of the aorto-uni-iliac configuration.</P>
<P>Since Parodi's landmark publication (<LINK REF="REF-Parodi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parodi 1991</LINK>) there has been much interest in the EVAR technique. Potential advantages of this 'less invasive' technique over conventional OSR include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>reduced time under general or regional anaesthesia;</LI>
<LI>avoidance of arterial cross-clamping, thus decreasing disruption of blood flow to vital organs and the lower extremities;</LI>
<LI>elimination of the pain and trauma of major abdominal surgery, enabling a shorter recovery time and potentially fewer respiratory complications;</LI>
<LI>reduced length of hospital stay;</LI>
<LI>reduced length of stay on an intensive care unit; </LI>
<LI>reduced blood loss.</LI>
</UL>
<P>All the above have the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality of AAA repair. The potential cost savings from reduced use of hospital facilities are offset by the cost of the stent-graft, which, in the UK, is approximately GBP5000, depending on the device used.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:15:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>AAA can be treated using OSR or EVAR, and in those individuals considered unfit for surgery, a conservative management option is available in current practice. It is however, unclear as to which is the best option; for example, EVAR has earlier survival advantage compared to OSR but its longevity is unknown. It is therefore necessary to understand clearly the short-, intermediate- and long-term risks or benefits of the available options as this has implications for clinical practice.</P>
<P>This review draws together the available trial evidence to assess the advantages and disadvantages of EVAR compared with conventional OSR in individuals with AAA considered fit for surgery, and with conservative care (no intervention) in those considered unfit to undergo OSR.</P>

<P>The primary intervention was elective EVAR repair of AAA. This can be performed with a variety of devices that fall into two main groups: aorto-bi-iliac devices and aorto-uni-iliac devices. We considered all device types. We compared EVAR repair with conventional OSR treatment in individuals considered fit for surgery, and with best medical care in those considered unfit for surgery. Complex and hybrid endovascular techniques (including fenestrated EVAR) were not considered in this review.</P>

<P>Three reviewers (SCVP, RJ and RC) independently assessed the quality of the included studies using the 'Risk of bias' tool developed by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool provides a standard protocol for allowing judgements to be made on sequence generation, allocation methods, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and any other relevant biases. For each of these six items we assessed the risk of bias as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk', with the 'unclear risk' of bias category being used to indicate either a lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> was a multicentre RCT carried out in 37 UK centres that compared outcomes following EVAR and OSR in individuals considered fit for conventional surgical repair. A total of 1252 individuals aged 60 years or older with an AAA size of at least 5.5 cm in size were recruited between 1 September 1999 and 31 August 2004. A total of 626 individuals each were randomised to receive EVAR or OSR using a permuted block method. Mean (standard deviation (SD)) age was 74.1 (6.1) years and mean AAA size was 6.4 (0.9) cm; the male:female ratio was 10:1. Participants were followed up for a median (interquartile range (IQR)) of 6.0 (3.9 to 7.3) years. After randomisation, 12 individuals in the EVAR group and 19 in the OSR group died before they underwent the procedure. Five participants in the OSR group refused surgery and the procedure was postponed for one participant in each of the EVAR and OSR groups. Eight participants in the OSR group and nine in the EVAR group were lost to follow up. Analysis was ITT. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included aneurysm-related mortality, postoperative complications, HRQoL, cost-effectiveness and durability.</P>
<P>The Dutch Randomised Endovascular Aneurysm Management (<LINK REF="STD-DREAM" TYPE="STUDY">DREAM</LINK>) trial recruited 351 individuals at 26 Dutch and four Belgian centres between 2000 and 2003. A total of 173 participants were randomised to undergo EVAR and 178 to undergo OSR. Four participants declined the procedure postrandomisation (three in the OSR group versus one in the EVAR group) and one participant in each of the OSR and EVAR groups died before surgery. All participants were followed-up for five years, with an overall 6.4 median years of follow up. All-cause and aneurysm-related mortality, procedural complications and reintervention rates were the outcomes assessed. Mean aneurysm size was 7.1 cm and the male:female ratio was 10:1.</P>
<P>Open Versus Endovascular Repair (<LINK REF="STD-OVER" TYPE="STUDY">OVER</LINK>) was a multicentre RCT conducted at 42 Veteran Affairs Medical centres in the USA. Between October 2002 and October 2008, 881 individuals aged 49 years or older with a AAA of at least 4.5 cm in size were randomised to undergo EVAR (n = 444) or OSR (n = 437). In the EVAR group, two refused repair, two died before surgery, one repair was aborted and 12 participants underwent open repair. In the OSR group, four refused repair, three repairs were aborted, one participant died before repair and 13 underwent EVAR. The intended follow-up period was until 2011. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included procedural failure, short-term morbidity, inhospital and intensive care stay, HRQoL and erectile dysfunction.</P>
<P>The Anevrysme de l'aorte abdominale, Chirurgie versus Endoprosthese (<LINK REF="STD-ACE" TYPE="STUDY">ACE</LINK>) trial was a French multicentre trial that randomised individuals with AAA in whom open surgery was considered a low-to-medium risk procedure to either EVAR or OSR. Of the 306 individuals recruited between 2003 and 2008, seven withdrew consent and were excluded. A total of 149 participants were randomised to OSR and 150 to EVAR. Seventeen participants in the OSR group underwent EVAR whereas four in the EVAR group underwent OSR, predominantly due to individual preference. One participant in the OSR group did not undergo surgery. ITT analysis was used. All-cause mortality and major adverse events (myocardial infarction, permanent stroke, permanent haemodialysis, major amputation, paraplegia and bowel infarction) were the main outcome measures. The reintervention rate and minor complications were the secondary outcome measures. Participants were followed up for a median of three years.</P>
<P>Unlike the aforementioned trials, <LINK REF="STD-EVAR2" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR2</LINK> assessed whether EVAR improves outcomes in individuals considered unfit for conventional OSR. Between September 1999 and August 2004, 404 high-risk surgical individuals with a mean (SD) age of 76.8 (6.5) years and a mean AAA size of 6.7 (1.0) cm were recruited. Participants were allocated to receive no intervention (n = 207) or EVAR (n = 197). In the EVAR group, 18 participants died before surgery, nine due to a ruptured aneurysm. In the no-intervention group, 70 participants underwent EVAR. The median (IQR) time from randomisation to surgery was 244 (83 to 643) days and 55 (38 to 77) days in the no-intervention and EVAR groups, respectively. Median (IQR) follow up was 3.6 (1.3 to 5.4) years, with fewer than 1% of participants lost to follow-up.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:15:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>The results of this meta-analysis of high-quality randomised trials found EVAR to be associated with a significantly lower short-term mortality than OSR (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; P &lt; 0.0001) in individuals considered fit for conventional surgery. Participants who died before surgery or those who did not undergo surgery were excluded from the analysis of short-term outcomes as we could not determine the timing of the deaths prior to intervention; these individuals were considered in the analyses of intermediate- and long-term outcomes. The short-term mortality rate reported for the EVAR group is similar to the 1.3% noted in the Registry of Endovascular Treatment of Aneurysms (RETA), a large UK-based endovascular registry containing data on 3159 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2005</LINK>). Although EVAR was associated with a significantly lower short-term mortality than OSR, this benefit did not persist at intermediate- and long-term follow up. ITT analyses found no difference in all-cause mortality at intermediate- and long-term follow up between the two groups (P = 0.40 and 0.78, respectively). The early benefit from EVAR is annulled by the number of late deaths from cardiac and other unrelated causes. Although the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> trialists, in an interim publication (<LINK REF="REF-EVAR1-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVAR1 2005</LINK>), noted a significantly lower aneurysm-related mortality at intermediatefollow up with EVAR than with OSR (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; P = 0.04), such a difference was not reported in their final analysis. Similarly, we found no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality between EVAR and OSR. One possible reason for this could be the occurrence of late ruptures after EVAR, as reported in the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Although an initial operative survival benefit was apparent with EVAR compared with OSR, we found no difference in the observed rate of complications between the EVAR and OSR groups. Both groups had similar incidences of strokes and renal impairment. Although we found no significant difference in the overall incidence of cardiac deaths between the EVAR and OSR groups, data from the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> trial found EVAR to be associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular deaths within six months of randomisation compared with OSR (adjusted HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; P = 0.021). This finding suggests that EVAR is associated with less cardiac stress in the early peri- and postoperative periods than OSR. No trial found a significant difference in HRQoL or sexual dysfunction between groups. Although there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group (P = 0.006), death from pulmonary causes did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.08).</P>
<P>Endovascular stent-graft-related complications led to a higher rate of reintervention in the EVAR group compared with the OSR group, and laparotomy-related reinterventions were the most common type of reintervention. However, not all trials recorded reintervention outcomes, and in most trials, participants randomised to OSR were not regularly followed up, which may have led to bias.The results of a recent Medicare study (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2011</LINK>) support the findings of our meta-analysis. The authors of this case-matched study involving 45,652 individuals concluded that the number of AAA-related reinterventions over a six-year follow up was significantly higher with EVAR than with OSR.</P>
<P>EVAR was associated with a shorter operative time and intensive care stay, and less blood loss than OSR, which may have a bearing on any cost-effectiveness analyses. It would seem that any costs of reintervention following EVAR could be balanced by the initial savings from a reduced operative time, less need for transfusion and a shorter hospital stay, as well as the costs of reinterventions for the treatment of incisional hernias following OSR. The <LINK REF="STD-OVER" TYPE="STUDY">OVER</LINK> trial showed that at two years there was no significant difference in costs between the two interventions. However, the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> trial, which reported long-term cost-effectiveness, found EVAR to be more expensive than OSR at an eight-year follow up.</P>
<P>Evidence for the use of EVAR in individuals considered unfit for surgery could only be drawn from a single RCT - the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR2" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR2</LINK> trial. Though there was no significant difference in long-term all-cause mortality between the EVAR and no-intervention groups, higher numbers of aneurysm-related deaths were noted in the no-intervention group compared with the EVAR group, which could be attributed to the higher number of ruptures in this group before undergoing repair. The trial found no significant differences in myocardial or stroke-related complications between groups. Both groups also had comparable HRQoL scores at baseline and at 12 to 24 months of follow up. However, EVAR was associated with a higher reintervention rate, making it more expensive than no intervention.</P>
<P>However, the EVAR2 trial has a number of limitations. First, the assessment of individuals as fit or unfit for surgery was based on factors such as their cardiac, respiratory and renal function (<LINK REF="STD-EVAR2" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR2</LINK>). Participants were considered for the EVAR2 trial if they were not suitable for open surgery because of cardiac conditions, such as severe cardiac valve disease, significant arrhythmia or uncontrolled congestive cardiac failure; respiratory symptoms, an inability to walk a flight of stairs, a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) less than 1.0 L, a PO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 8.0 kPa or a PCO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 6.5 kPa; or renal impairment, with serum creatinine levels greater than 200 mol/L (<LINK REF="STD-EVAR2" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR2</LINK>). Despite this guidance, participant recruitment was left entirely to the discretion of the individual participating centre, which could have introduced significant bias in the study cohort. Further, in current UK practice, a preoperative checklist is used to record major comorbidities or symptoms, which are graded in a manner similar to the UK traffic light system as red, amber or green. For those individuals falling in the red or amber categories, the appropriate specialty opinion is sought and considered for the preoperative optimisation of their comorbidities. Individuals in the green category will undergo cardiac and respiratory function tests, either individual tests or as part of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, to determine their fitness for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-AAAQIP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAAQIP 2011</LINK>). As current practice for the assessment of individual fitness differs significantly from that used when the EVAR2 trial was conducted (1994 to 2004), the participants selected for the EVAR2 trial may not be representative of individuals who would currently be considered unfit for surgery. Secondly, there was a notable delay in participants undergoing an intervention after randomisation in EVAR2, during which some died due to rupture of the aneurysm. This contributed to an increased early mortality rate in the EVAR group. Finally, a notable number of participants in the no-intervention group underwent surgical intervention, which could have balanced the odds between the two group; hence the NICE guideline on endovascular stent-grafts considered the evidence from the EVAR2 trial as "not definitive" (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-EVAR-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE EVAR 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, the results of this meta-analysis show an early survival benefit for EVAR compared with OSR and 'no-intervention', with no significant long-term benefit and higher costs for EVAR. The results of this analysis should be interpreted with caution, however, especially the need for reintervention, due to the identified heterogeneity. Although a higher reintervention rate was seen with EVAR than with OSR, most such reinterventions were minor catheter-based interventions associated with low mortality. Further, incisional hernia repair post-OSR was not recorded in the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACE" TYPE="STUDY">ACE</LINK> trials. Hence, reintervention rates reported for the OSR group may not be accurate. In contrast, in the <LINK REF="STD-OVER" TYPE="STUDY">OVER</LINK> trial, the incidence of incisional hernias and the interventions to correct them did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.26). Most reinterventions in the EVAR and OSR groups were secondary to endoleaks and incisional hernias, respectively. It may be argued that reintervention following EVAR may partially be due to the type of stent-grafts used. However, both the <LINK REF="STD-EVAR1" TYPE="STUDY">EVAR1</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DREAM" TYPE="STUDY">DREAM</LINK> trials used second- and third-generation devices, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-OVER" TYPE="STUDY">OVER</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACE" TYPE="STUDY">ACE</LINK> trials used third- and fourth-generation devices.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>This review addressed the role of EVAR as an alternative to OSR in individuals considered fit for surgery (i.e. individuals in whom surgery is considered a low-to-medium-risk procedure) and as an alternative to conservative management in those considered unfit (i.e. individuals in whom surgery is considered a high-risk procedure) for surgery. Most outcome measures assessing morbidity and mortality were available from the trials included in the review. However, not all trials provided data on cost-effectiveness, sexual dysfunction and reintervention after OSR. Taking these minor elements into consideration, this review shows that there is good-quality evidence available to assess the role of EVAR.</P>

A recent meta-analysis has also reported EVAR to have a short-term advantage over OSR (<LINK REF="REF-Dangas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dangas 2012</LINK>); however this meta-analysis also found EVAR to have an intermediate-term advantage with regard to AAA-related mortality compared with OSR, a finding not supported by the current meta-analysis; this finding may be attributed to differences in the definitions used to describe an intermediate follow up in these two studies (two years in the <LINK REF="REF-Dangas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dangas 2012</LINK> meta-analysis compared with four years in our review). In line with the results of a large Medicare study involving 45,652 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2011</LINK>), we also found reintervention rates to be significantly higher after EVAR than after OSR. Hence, the results of our meta-analysis are a reflection of clinical practice.</P>
<P>More recently, a meta-analysis comparing the perioperative and long-term mortality of OSR versus EVAR has been published and these results concur with those of this review in that EVAR has a short-term benefit over OSR, with no difference in outcomes in the longer term (<LINK REF="REF-Karthikesalingam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karthikesalingam 2013</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharath C V  Paravastu">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharath C V  Paravastu">
<P>In individuals considered fit for conventional surgery, EVAR was associated with lower short-term mortality than OSR. All-cause mortality with EVAR was significantly lower than that with OSR in the short term, with the benefit disappearing in the intermediate and long term. Operative complications, HRQoL and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between EVAR and OSR. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group compared with the EVAR group. EVAR was associated with a higher reintervention rate than OSR. Most reinterventions with EVAR, however, were catheter-based interventions associated with low mortality.</P>
<P>In individuals considered unfit for open surgery, the results of a single trial found no short- or long-term benefits of EVAR over no intervention with regard to all-cause mortality, but individual outcomes may differ and individual preferences should always be taken into account.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-16 10:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharath C V  Paravastu">
<P>Although EVAR showed an early survival benefit over OSR, stent-graft durability is an area of interest and studies presenting long-term results of newer devices would be useful in addressing this issue. Estimating the cost-effectiveness of EVAR is another key issue; hence, studies looking at the long-term outcomes of EVAR are essential. Although further randomised trials may not reveal more about the short-term benefit of EVAR over OSR, controlled trials evaluating the role of new-generation stent-grafts may prove useful.</P>
<P>Follow up of EVAR is an area of significant interest. Currently, different investigative modalities use varying follow-up strategies. Research into identifying the most reliable follow-up strategy and identifying the right investigative modality may help determine the benefit of EVAR in the long term. These findings will be of great value when calculating the cost-effectiveness of EVAR.</P>

<P>We investigated the risk of bias using the 'Risk of bias' tool developed by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and not by the methods described by Jadad and Schulz, as originally planned in the protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2002</LINK>). We have divided the types of outcomes measured into primary and secondary outcomes, in keeping with the most recent Cochrane recommendations. We have further defined and clarified outcomes to reflect current clinical relevance.</P>

<P>This study randomised participants in a 3:1 format, where 57 participants were randomised to EVAR and 19 to OSR. Further they present health-related quality of life outcomes estimated at 3 months post surgery. The numbers of participants considered for study, especially in the OSR group, were small and the outcomes were estimated at 3 months only. Therefore, the results may not be a true representative of the effects of the interventions and hence the study was excluded from analysis.</P>
