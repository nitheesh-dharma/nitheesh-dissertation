<P>
<B>What was the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether strategies to increase the number of health professionals working in rural and underserved areas are effective. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration searched for all new studies that could answer this question, given that the previous review done in 2009 did not identify any high certainty evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the review conclude?</B>
</P>
<P>We were only able to identify one new study with very low certainty of evidence. Therefore, we remain uncertain about the effects of these types of strategies. Well conducted interventional studies with appropriate control or comparison groups are needed to assess critically the impact of strategies to increase the number of health professionals working in underserved areas.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>All countries have areas that are relatively underserved by health professionals; mostly among rural communities and the urban poor. This problem is seen across the world, but is particularly serious in low- and middle-income countries.</P>
<P>While some health professionals choose to work in underserved areas, we need strategies to persuade more of them to do so. Different strategies have been used. For example, some medical schools try to recruit more students with a rural background or arrange for students to practice in rural settings in the hope that graduates will return to those areas to practice. Scholarships, grants, loan repayment schemes and higher salaries have been offered to attract health professionals to underserved areas, while countries also utilise mandatory redeployment strategies. Although some strategies have shown promise, there is a lack of well-designed studies to measure the short-term and long-term effectiveness of these strategies in a rigorous fashion.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>This review found one new study that evaluated the effect of a National Health Insurance scheme on the distribution of health professionals in Taiwan. Before the implementation of National Health Insurance, people living in rural areas were less able to afford medical costs than their urban counterparts. The implementation of a National Health Insurance scheme made medical care more affordable for all Taiwanese citizens in both urban and rural areas. This may have led to better geographical distribution of health professionals. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effects of National Health Insurance schemes on the distribution of health professionals.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to April 2014.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:04:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, including specialised register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group; March 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1988 to March 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March 2014), LILACS (February 2014), Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (up to April 2014), Global Health (March 2014) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (June 2013). We also searched reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:04:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating the effects of various interventions (e.g. educational, financial, regulatory or support strategies) on the recruitment or retention, or both, of health professionals in underserved areas.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:06:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full texts of potentially relevant studies for eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-18 10:52:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this first update of the original review, we screened 8945 records for eligibility. We retrieved and assessed the full text of 125 studies. Only one study met the inclusion criteria of the review. This interrupted time series study, conducted in Taiwan, found that the implementation of a National Health Insurance scheme in 1995 was associated with improved equity in the geographic distribution of physicians and dentists. We judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this one study very low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:06:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently limited reliable evidence regarding the effects of interventions aimed at addressing the inequitable distribution of health professionals. Well-designed studies are needed to confirm or refute findings of observational studies of educational, financial, regulatory and supportive interventions that might influence healthcare professionals' decisions to practice in underserved areas. Governments and medical schools should ensure that when interventions are implemented, their impacts are evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods to establish the true effects of these measures on healthcare professional recruitment and retention in rural and other underserved settings.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:42:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inequitable distribution of healthcare professionals within countries contributes to poorly functioning health services in many parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Globally, 50% of the population live in rural areas and are served by 23% of the global health workforce, 38% of the total nursing workforce and 24% of the total physician workforce (<LINK REF="REF-Scheil_x002d_Adlung-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheil-Adlung 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). In Canadian metropolitan areas there are approximately 2.6 physicians per 1000 people, whereas in Canadian rural areas there are 0.9 physicians per 1000 people (<LINK REF="REF-Viscomi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscomi 2013</LINK>). Similarly in Australia there are 4.0 doctors per 1000 people in the major cities and 2.4 doctors per 1000 people in the remote/very remote areas of the country (<LINK REF="REF-National-Rural-Health-Alliance-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Rural Health Alliance 2013</LINK>). Statistics from 2010 from China show a similar rural/urban disparity in the distribution of health-care professionals with 3.04 health technicians per 1000 people in rural areas and 7.62 health technicians per 1000 people in urban areas (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), inequities in healthcare service provision are even greater. For instance, in South Africa, 44% of the population live in rural areas and are served by only 12% of doctors and 19% of nurses (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SA-HRH-strategy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SA HRH strategy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Statistics-SA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Statistics SA 1996</LINK>). In Ghana, 87% of general physicians worked in urban areas serving only 44% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Dussault-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dussault 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, in Senegal, 60% of the country's physicians work in Dakar where only 23% of the population live (<LINK REF="STD-Zurn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zurn 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The inequitable distribution of healthcare professionals between countries resulting from a combination of under-production of healthcare professionals in poorer countries and net migration to the economically more developed parts of the world is also a cause for concern (<LINK REF="REF-Mullan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullan 2005</LINK>). Thirty-seven per cent of the world's health workers work in the World Health Organization (WHO) region of the Americas, which accounts for only 10% of the global burden of disease. By contrast, the WHO African region, with 24% of the global burden of disease, is served by only 3% of the world's health workers. Furthermore, the African continent, with the highest global disease burden, has the lowest density of healthcare professionals (2.3 healthcare professionals per 1000 population) and spends the lowest proportion (29.5%) of government health expenditure on health worker salaries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). The emigration of skilled professionals from LMICs to high-income countries (HICs), while alleviating the shortage of healthcare professionals in HICs, contributes to human resource shortages in the health systems of poorer countries. One Cochrane review examined the effect of interventions to reduce the emigration of healthcare professionals from LMICs to HICs (<LINK REF="REF-Penaloza-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penaloza 2011</LINK>), therefore we will not consider these interventions in our review.</P>
<P>The shortage of healthcare professionals compounds the problem of inequitable distribution. Based on a threshold of 41.1 health workers per 10,000 population, there is a global deficit of 10.3 million health workers, seven million of whom are needed in rural areas compared to the three million needed in urban areas (<LINK REF="REF-Scheil_x002d_Adlung-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheil-Adlung 2015</LINK>). In Africa, 77% of the rural population, compared to 50% of the urban population, lacks access to health care due to the shortage of skilled health workers (<LINK REF="REF-Scheil_x002d_Adlung-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheil-Adlung 2015</LINK>). It has been estimated that by 2015, the target date of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, there will be a shortage of 800,000 healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses and midwives) in 31 African countries (<LINK REF="REF-Scheffler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheffler 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Possible factors contributing to the reduced number of healthcare professionals in rural and urban underserved areas include demanding working conditions, substandard medical equipment and facilities, inadequate financial remuneration, inadequate opportunities for personal and professional development, safety concerns, and lack of job opportunities for spouse and educational opportunities for children (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 2008</LINK>). It has been suggested that a country's ability to recruit and retain healthcare professionals in underserved areas ultimately depends upon the provision of a stable, rewarding and fulfilling personal and professional environment (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2002</LINK>), yet the provision of such an environment continues to elude most countries, independent of their income status.</P>
<P>In resource-constrained countries, rural and other underserved areas are generally worst afflicted by problems such as unemployment, poverty, malnutrition, lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation (<LINK REF="REF-Boulle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulle 1997</LINK>). These factors often lie at the heart of the poor health experienced by people living in these areas (<LINK REF="REF-Strasser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasser 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The spatial maldistribution of health workers means that those who have the greatest need have the poorest services; thus fulfilling Hart's "inverse care law" (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1971</LINK>). Literature from sub-Saharan Africa shows that treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been severely hampered not merely by the lack of financial resources or medical supplies but by the shortage of healthcare personnel needed to deliver the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In Uganda, lack of skilled staff at the primary care level is one of the reasons why pregnant women do not utilise community maternity services, but resort to traditional birthing practices, which result in higher rates of maternal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kyomuhendo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyomuhendo 2003</LINK>). The current Ebola crisis in West Africa is a stark reminder of the importance of high-quality health systems, of which sufficient and appropriately trained staff are an integral part. Before the Ebola outbreak, the entire population of Liberia (4.3 million people) was served by 51 physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Boozary-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boozary 2014</LINK>). In Sierra Leone, there are two physicians for every 100,000 people, compared to 245 physicians per 100,000 people in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Rid-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rid 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Such excessively overburdened health systems cannot deal with the everyday healthcare needs of the population, let alone the outbreak of a deadly virus such as Ebola.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Regulatory strategies</HEADING>

Support strategies might include a functional work environment (i.e. hospital or clinic infrastructure and medical equipment in working order), effective management, supervision and mentoring, improved professional development (e.g. opportunities for both career development and continuing education), provision of locum relief, support from colleagues and networks of practitioners, and adequate housing and school facilities. One review summarised and appraised the effectiveness of such interventions on change in practitioner behaviour, service outcome or patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2014</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Targeted admission policies for medical schools</HEADING>
<P>Based on evidence from retrospective studies, it is believed that male students with a rural background who intend to practice rural medicine upon entry to medical school are more likely to be recruited to and retained in a rural practice (<LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabinowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabinowitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabinowitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabinowitz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabinowitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rabinowitz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Western-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Western 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woloschuk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woloschuk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woloschuk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woloschuk 2004</LINK>). The 2010 WHO technical report found evidence of moderate certainty that medical students from rural backgrounds were more likely to work in rural areas upon graduation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). This finding was based on the findings of a review (<LINK REF="REF-Laven-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laven 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laven-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laven 2003b</LINK>), and several other studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2003" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabinowitz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rabinowitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woloschuk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woloschuk 2004</LINK>). However, the issues of bias and confounding, common to all observational studies, may limit the validity of these findings.</P>
<P>Furthermore, special primary care and rural health programmes have been implemented at a number of medical schools. These programmes involve special admission for students from rural backgrounds who express an interest in practicing family medicine in a rural area, as well as special curricular components and financial aid. A number of observational studies have shown an association between these programmes and an increase in the number of physicians entering rural practice (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moores-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moores 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabinowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabinowitz 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Location of medical schools, medical school campuses and family medicine residency programmes</HEADING>
<P>A number of countries have established medical schools, specific medical school campuses family medicine programmes, or a combination of these in rural or underserved areas in an attempt to entice graduates of these programmes to work in these areas upon graduation (<LINK REF="REF-Curran-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curran 2004</LINK>). The Australian Rural Clinical School initiative established in 2000/2001 aims to increase recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals in rural areas through rurally based undergraduate clinical training experience (<LINK REF="STD-Eley-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2004</LINK>). One time series analysis evaluated the impact of clinical rotations through rural clinical schools during the third and fourth years of medical training at the University of Queensland. Following the establishment of the rural clinical schools, the number of medical students selecting rural regional hospitals as their preferred site for internship increased; whereas the number of students requesting rural intern employment at institutions without a rural clinical school remained the same during this time period (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2004</LINK>). It is not known to what extent choice of a rural internship predicts future practice in a rural location.</P>
<P>One study conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that 81% of the graduates from the rural medical school were employed in rural areas in the province where they trained, with only 26% of the graduates from the urban medical school employed in rural areas in the province in which they were trained (<LINK REF="STD-Longombe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Longombe 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Undergraduate and postgraduate training exposure and location</HEADING>
<P>Studies investigating the effect of rural clerkships/rotations and preceptorships in underserved areas often have "change in student attitudes towards rural practice" or "intention to practice rural" as their outcome measures. While these outcomes may be seen as proxies of recruitment to rural practice, such outcomes do not reflect actual practice location upon graduation. Such outcomes may also be subject to information bias in that the participants may tell the interviewer what the participant thinks the interviewer wants to hear.</P>
<P>A further proxy for practice in an underserved area used in some studies is choice of a primary care or family practice speciality. The impact of a third year family practice clerkship on medical students' choice of family practice as a speciality was investigated in a controlled, longitudinal study (<LINK REF="REF-Campos_x002d_Outcalt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos-Outcalt 1999</LINK>). Graduates' family practice speciality choice was noted for three years before and after the introduction of the clerkship. Family practice speciality choice of graduates from schools that did not have a third year family practice clerkship was used as the control data. There was a significant increase in the number of graduates who chose family practice as a speciality in the three years following the introduction of the clerkship (<LINK REF="REF-Campos_x002d_Outcalt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos-Outcalt 1999</LINK>). In four quasi-randomised trials, medical students who were exposed to an undergraduate primary care clerkship or curriculum track were more likely to choose family practice residencies (<LINK REF="STD-Erney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Erney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herold-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Herold 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1979</LINK>). These studies had the limitation that choice of a primary care or family practice speciality may not equate with practice in rural or underserved areas in all settings.</P>
<P>Between 1979 and 1993 the University of New Mexico School of Medicine offered two different curricular programmes - a conventional programme and a primary care curriculum (a community-oriented, problem-based programme) - during the first two years of medical school. A survey investigating the effect of the primary care curriculum on graduates practice patterns reported that primary care curriculum graduates were significantly more likely to work in medically underserved areas than the conventional program graduates (<LINK REF="STD-Mennin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mennin 1996</LINK>). As medical students in this study self selected their programmes it is not possible to disentangle the effect of the curricular exposure from that of students' prior characteristics.</P>
<P>Evidence from retrospective cohort studies suggests that faculty role models influenced physicians' choice to specialise in family medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Campos_x002d_Outcalt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos-Outcalt 1995</LINK>). However, two prospective controlled observational studies did not show an effect of instruction by family physician faculty on the students' decision to follow a family practice residency (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Financial incentives</HEADING>
<P>Government bodies attempt to encourage healthcare professionals to practice in underserved areas through various financial support-for-service programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Pathman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pathman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pathman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pathman 2004</LINK>). Evidence regarding the impact of these programmes on the recruitment and retention of health-care professionals in underserved areas is based on descriptive, cross-sectional surveys (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pathman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pathman 2004</LINK>) and retrospective cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Pathman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pathman 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-B_x00e4_rnighausen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bärnighausen 2009</LINK> systematically reviewed financial incentives for return of service in underserved areas. The systematic review presented findings from 43 studies (34 from the USA and the remaining studies from Canada, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa). All of the studies were observational studies and considered various types of loans and scholarship schemes. The authors reported promising results with regards to retention of healthcare professionals in underserved areas following the initial obligation period. An earlier systematic review of 10 studies investigating the effectiveness of financial incentives in exchange for rural and underserved area return-of-service commitments reported that financial return of service programmes appear to be effective in the short term; their long-term effectiveness was unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Sempowski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sempowski 2004</LINK>). One prospective cohort study included in this review found that physicians who voluntarily chose to practice in rural areas were more likely to stay in rural areas compared to physicians working in rural areas due to return-of-service commitments (<LINK REF="REF-Sempowski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sempowski 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some governments have introduced additional rural allowances in an effort to attract and retain healthcare professionals in these underserved areas. The effect of rural allowances on the distribution of healthcare professionals is being monitored and evaluated by questionnaire-based surveys (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Regulatory strategies</HEADING>
<P>Coercive strategies can address shortages in the short term, but forced redeployment of poorly prepared or motivated staff may defeat the purpose. A number of coercive strategies, such as compulsory community service and restricting recruited foreign doctors to rural practice, have been adopted by governments in an attempt to address the shortage of healthcare professionals in medically underserved areas (<LINK REF="REF-Cavender-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavender 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Frehywot-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frehywot 2010</LINK> reviewed the various compulsory service programmes instituted in countries around the globe. The paper describes the various programmes and attempts to provide some insight into the effectiveness of the programmes. Compulsory service programmes have been adopted by more than 70 countries including Russia, Mexico, Norway, Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Frehywot-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frehywot 2010</LINK>). While most of the countries have not measured the effectiveness of the compulsory service programmes, those that have found mixed results with respect to retention of healthcare professionals in underserved areas (<LINK REF="STD-Frehywot-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frehywot 2010</LINK>) and there are concerns that a negative experience may adversely affect future career decisions to work in an underserved area (<LINK REF="REF-Marais-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marais 2007</LINK>). Although widely practiced, the effect of recruiting foreign doctors to work in underserved areas on the distribution of healthcare professionals, and consequent provision of health services, has not been thoroughly assessed. Coercive strategies may provide short-term solutions; however, there is concern that these strategies will alienate people from the profession and underserved areas in particular and thus prove counterproductive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Professional and personal support</HEADING>
<P>Questionnaire-based surveys suggest that professional and personal support may also influence healthcare professionals' choice to work in underserved areas. Professional development, ongoing training and style of health service management were important factors influencing retention of healthcare professionals in underserved areas (<LINK REF="REF-Kotzee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotzee 2006</LINK>). Poor living conditions and inadequate health care and education facilities were unanimously declared to be barriers to working in rural and remote areas (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 2008</LINK>). The WHO technical report found very little information on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at professional development of healthcare professionals working in rural and underserved areas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Continued education and training and career development opportunities were reported to be important motivational issues with respect to retaining healthcare professionals in rural and remote areas (<LINK REF="REF-Willis_x002d_Shattuck-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis-Shattuck 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Evidence from cross-country ecological analyses show an increased probability of survival and better health outcomes with an increase in the number of healthcare workers per population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). There are also studies showing that lower nurse-to-patient ratios lead to more complications and poorer patient outcomes, at hospital level (<LINK REF="REF-Aiken-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiken 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aiken-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiken 2001</LINK>). It is important to note that staff shortages, in general, impact negatively on the motivation of the existing staff - as they have to deal with increased workload - and may contribute to staff attrition. Given the wide array of strategies that have been adopted to influence locality of practice, educationalists and policy makers need to know which of these strategies are supported by scientific evidence of effectiveness and impact.</P>

<P>We conducted data analysis using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). For RCT data, we planned to calculate outcome measures for dichotomous data (e.g. the proportion of decreasing consumption) as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data (e.g. mean age of initiation) we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and standard deviations (SDs) where means were reported. For cohort and other study design data, if the data had been analysed correctly, we preferentially reported on the adjusted analysis using the estimate of effect reported in the study. If the incorrect analyses had been used, we planned to re-analyse the data appropriately using the crude data. Where only crude data were presented, where appropriate, we calculated the crude RRs and 95% CIs for dichotomous data and MDs and SDs for continuous data where means were reported. If data were skewed, we planned to report medians.</P>
<P>We reported the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK> in narrative form as reported by the authors. However, <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK> analysed their data using spline regression, which is correct when there are independent outcomes. However, in this study one cannot assume that the observations are independent. The Gini coefficient in any one year will be dependent on the Gini coefficient from the previous year as neither the population nor the number of doctors fluctuates randomly. By using spline regression the authors do not take the auto-correlated structure of the data into account.

<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK> used interrupted trend analysis with time series observations to assess the impact of the implementation of National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan on the geographic distribution of three different health providers, Western medicine physicians, Chinese medicine physicians and dentists over 32 years (1971 to 2002). The equality of the geographic distribution of the health providers was measured using Gini coefficients (Gini coefficient of 0 = no inequality; Gini coefficient of 1 = complete inequality) for each of the 21 prefectures/cities in Taiwan. The investigators examined the distribution of health providers 24 years prior to NHI and eight years after the implementation of NHI (in 1995; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK>). Taiwan's NHI is administered by a government-run insurer. Enrolment in the NHI is mandatory for all citizens. It entails a single-payer system and provides comprehensive benefits including dental care and Chinese medicine. The authors reported that by 1995 the NHI had enrolled 96% of the Taiwanese population.</P>

<P>We excluded almost all the studies investigating recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals because their study design did not meet the inclusion criteria of the review. We excluded other studies because the outcomes measured were surrogate markers of recruitment and retention, for example, medical school student's intention to practice in a rural setting. Four quasi-randomised trials, one controlled trial and one ITS study were brought to our attention by experts in the field. The reasons for excluding these studies from the review are stipulated in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.

<P>We assessed the risk of bias of the eligible study using the EPOC suggested risk of bias criteria for ITS studies (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). We provide a full description of the risk of bias for the included study in the text below. The risk of bias of the study is summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Was the intervention independent of other changes?</HEADING>
<P>High risk of bias: we cannot be sure that the intervention was independent of other changes. However, in an attempt to account for other variables (socioeconomic, political) that may have influenced the geographic distribution of health providers, the study authors included a year-specific time trend variable (T<SUB>t</SUB>) in their analysis model. The authors limited the post NHI observations to 2002 in order to exclude the possible effect of other health insurance measures adopted by the Taiwanese Government after the introduction of the NHI (e.g. pay-for performance in 2001, global budgeting in 2002 and regressive payment to service volume for assuring quality of care in 2004) on health provider distribution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Was the shape of the intervention effect pre-specified?</HEADING>
<P>Unclear risk of bias: the authors did not specifically state how they felt the implementation of the NHI would affect the outcome of interest. However, the authors did state that any changes occurring as a result of the intervention would be gradual and this was accounted for in the analyses and the variables included in the analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Was the intervention unlikely to affect data collection?</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: sources and methods of data collection were similar before and after the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: even though the health providers would have been aware of the implementation of the NHI, the outcome was objective and was obtained at a national level from published government records.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: although the authors did not report the extent of missing data, the outcome was obtained from routine government records for the entire period of analysis, without any change in practice. Therefore, any potential flaws inherent to the data are likely to have been present throughout the time period</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Was the study free from selective outcome reporting?</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: while we do not have access to the study protocol, all relevant outcomes in the methods section are reported in the results section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Was the study free from other risks of bias?</HEADING>
<P>Unclear risk of bias: while the authors declared that they had no competing interests, the funding source of the study was not reported. In addition, the historical nature of the data reduces the risk of political expediency.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK> assessed the effect of NHI on the distribution of Western medicine physicians, Chinese medicine physicians and dentists over 32 years (1971 to 2002) in Taiwan. The authors presented data on the equality of the distribution of the health providers for 24 years prior to NHI and eight years after the implementation of NHI in 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK>). The equality of the geographic distribution of the health providers was measured by Gini coefficients. A Gini coefficient of 0 represented 'no inequality' and a Gini coefficient of 1 represented 'complete inequality'.</P>
<P>At one year post implementation of the NHI scheme, inequality of geographic distribution of Western medicine physicians (estimate, SE: -0.008, 0.004, P value = 0.071), Chinese medicine physicians (estimate, SE: -0.007, 0.013, P value = 0.589) and dentists (estimate, SE: -0.013, 0.017, P value = 0.444) improved when compared to the expected level based on the pre-intervention trend for each discipline.</P>
<P>At four years after the implementation of NHI scheme, the geographic distribution of Western medicine physicians (estimate, SE: -0.018, 0.003, P value = 0.00), Chinese medicine physicians (estimate, SE: -0.016, 0.011, P value = 0.172) and dentists (estimate, SE: -0.039, 0.03, P value = 0.196) was more equitable compared to the expected level based on the pre-intervention trend.</P>
<P>At eight years post implementation of NHI scheme, there was a similar trend. The inequality of geographic distribution of Western medicine physicians (estimate, SE: -0.032, 0.005, P value = 0.00), Chinese medicine physicians (estimate, SE: -0.025, 0.016, P value = 0.143) and dentists (estimate, SE: -0.073, 0.056, P value = 0.201) improved compared to the expected level based on the pre-intervention trend.</P>
<P>Prior to the implementation of the NHI, Western medicine physicians were more equally distributed across all Taiwanese prefectures compared to Chinese medicine physicians and dentists (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK>). This improved further after implementation of the NHI scheme compared to the expected level based on the pre-intervention trend. Although these results suggest a reduction in the inequitable distribution of these health professionals, the changes were small.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:17:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main finding of this review is that there is a dearth of well-designed studies in which bias and confounding have been minimised to guide the implementation of interventions to address the shortage of healthcare professionals practicing in underserved areas. Only one ITS study conducted in Taiwan met the stipulated inclusion criteria of the review. The study found that the implementation of a NHI scheme reduced inequalities in the distribution of Western medicine physicians, Chinese medicine physicians and dentists in Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2013</LINK>). Prior to the implementation of the NHI, people living in urban areas were more likely to be able to afford higher medical costs. Therefore, it was more financially rewarding for health providers to work in urban areas compared to the poorer rural areas. The study authors reasoned that universal NHI coverage made medical care more affordable for all Taiwanese citizens, irrespective of their financial means or geographic location. Health providers practicing in both urban and rural areas received the same payment for the provision of medical care, reducing previous financial disincentives to work in underserved areas where people were less able to afford medical care.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The main reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence was serious concerns regarding risk of bias and serious concerns regarding the indirectness of the data from one study conducted in one country. The study results may not be generalisable or transferable to other settings.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-18 10:48:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of reviews have investigated the effectiveness of interventions to improve recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals in rural and underserved areas. The main difference between these reviews and our review is that the other reviews have included research findings from studies with all types of study designs, including uncontrolled observational study designs. <LINK REF="STD-Dolea-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dolea 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2009</LINK> provided comprehensive overviews of the available evidence, but emphasised the urgent need for more rigorous assessment of study interventions. While the findings of these reviews are useful, one must bear in mind the certainty of the evidence upon which the conclusions of the reviews were based. All of the review authors agree that more robust, good-quality research needs to be conducted. <LINK REF="REF-Viscomi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscomi 2013</LINK> reviewed the findings of 86 studies investigating interventions to recruit and retain general practitioners in rural Canada and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Viscomi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscomi 2013</LINK>). Factors such as rural background (of medical student or partner, or both), male gender, interest in living in a rural area and meaningful rural elective exposure during medical training were some of the important indicators related to rural practice (<LINK REF="REF-Viscomi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscomi 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The latest technical report prepared by the WHO found evidence of moderate certainty that medical students from rural backgrounds were more likely to work in rural areas upon graduation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). The report found very little information on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at professional development of healthcare professionals working in rural and underserved areas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another relatively recent review focusing on effective retention incentives found that financial incentives and healthcare worker obligation were the most commonly utilised retention strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Buykx-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buykx 2010</LINK>). Both of these strategies appeared to be effective in the short-term but their effectiveness in retaining healthcare professionals in rural areas was not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Buykx-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buykx 2010</LINK>). Additional high-quality research investigating personal and work-related factors is needed (<LINK REF="STD-Buykx-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buykx 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2009</LINK> conducted a critical review of interventions to redress the inequitable distribution of healthcare professionals in rural and remote areas, irrespective of meeting pre-defined study criteria. This comprehensive overview utilised a simple grading system to rate the certainty of the evidence for specific interventions (selection criteria; pre- and post-vocational training; medical school location; coercive, incentives and support strategies). Strong evidence supported selection criteria such as rural background, intention to practice in a rural setting and male gender, as well as post-vocational training in generalist specialities such as rural health and family medicine (with major bias from self selection; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnighausen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barnighausen 2009</LINK> systematically reviewed financial incentives for return of service in underserved areas. The systematic review presented findings from 43 studies (34 from the USA and the remaining studies from Canada, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa). All studies included in the review were observational studies and considered various types of loans and scholarship schemes. The authors reported promising results with regards to retention of healthcare professionals in underserved areas following the initial obligation period (<LINK REF="STD-Barnighausen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barnighausen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>One review looking at incentives, motivation and subsequent retention of health workers in developing countries found that the importance of the various motivational factors varied between countries. However, financial incentives, career development opportunities and sound management were similarly important across the developing countries investigated in the reviewed studies (<LINK REF="REF-Willis_x002d_Shattuck-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis-Shattuck 2008</LINK>). Financial incentives alone were not enough to motivate and retain health workers. Health worker morale was affected by recognition, adequate medical resources and equipment, and appropriate infrastructure (<LINK REF="REF-Willis_x002d_Shattuck-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis-Shattuck 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 2008</LINK> provided a conceptual framework of the international, national, work, local (home and social) and individual environmental factors that impact on the attraction and retention of health workers in LMICs. The review authors recommended that the attraction and retention factors specific to country, area and healthcare facility be assessed first and then combinations of various strategies be implemented to address these factors (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 2008</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:18:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently limited reliable evidence regarding the effects of interventions aimed at addressing the inequitable distribution of health professionals. Evidence from one study suggested that providing universal coverage through a National Health Insurance policy and standardising the cost of health care on a national level is associated with a more equal distribution of health providers. Although these results suggest a reduction in the inequitable distribution of these health professionals, these changes were small. We judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this one study and the generalisability of the findings to be very low. Despite the dearth of reliable evidence, governments and medical schools have implemented numerous strategies aimed at addressing the shortage of healthcare professionals practicing in underserved areas. Rigorous evaluation of the benefits and risks of various strategies is required to determine the true impact of these interventions and to inform future policy better. The inequitable distribution of healthcare professionals in underserved areas reflects multiple factors with complex interactions that may vary across different settings. More rigorous evidence is required to guide tailored interventions and identify generalisable principles.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-17 21:18:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Observational studies suggest that a number of factors related to student selection criteria, undergraduate and postgraduate training, financial incentives, regulatory measures, and personal and professional support may influence healthcare professionals' choice to practice in underserved areas. Strategies that have shown promise include selection of students with a rural background, the establishment of university departments or teaching clinics (or both) in rural areas, rural and scarce skills allowances, and enhanced professional and personal support. However, these findings await confirmation or refutation by means of well-designed studies in which bias and confounding are minimised. Future studies should also take into account the different contexts and settings in which the inequitable distribution of healthcare professionals occur, for example, the type of healthcare professional, the presiding cultural expectations and social pressures, the type of intervention, the location of the underserved community (i.e. rural versus urban) and the income or development status of the country.</P>

<P>The review followed the protocol as it was published, with no differences in methodology. The authorship of the review protocol is not the same as the authorship of the published or the currently updated review. Helmuth Reuter and Philemon Marindi were both authors of the review protocol and the first published version of the review. However, neither of them were involved in the update of the current version of the review. Both of them requested that they not be included in the authorship of the updated review as they felt that they did not have the time required to remain involved that would warrant authorship.

<P>Interrupted trend analysis with time series observations over 32 years (24 years before intervention and 8 years post intervention). The equality of geographic distributions for each of the 3 types of health providers is measured by Gini coefficients derived from Lorenz curve based on 21 prefecture/city assigned by the Ministry of Interior. A Lorenz curve of cumulative wealth or income vs. population, for instance, plots cumulative population in ascending order on the X-axis against the cumulative wealth or income in those areas on the Y-axis. The Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz curve that provides an alternative numerical measure for the extent of equal distribution in wealth or income. Its value lies between 0 (no inequality) and 1 (complete inequality). The dependent variable Gini coefficient in this study was a summarised result of the accumulation the number of physicians against the accumulation of population of all the 21 geographic areas (in the order of physician concentration in a prefecture/city) compared to perfect distribution of physicians (i.e. for a certain percentage of population it has the same percentage of physicians. For example, 40% of population has 40% of physicians, 70% of population has 70% of physicians, accumulated from the lowest to the highest ratio of physicians to population in an area).</P>

The authors limited the post NHI observations to 2002 in order to exclude the possible effect of other health insurance measures adopted by the Taiwanese Government after the introduction of the NHI (e.g. pay-for performance in 2001, global budgeting in 2002 and regressive payment to service volume for assuring quality of care in 2004) on health provider distribution.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Data were analysed using spline regression, which is absolutely correct when you have independent outcomes but assumes that the regression is not linear across all the scales. In this instance, one cannot assume that the observations are independent. The Gini coefficient one year will be dependent on the Gini coefficient from the previous year (the population does not fluctuate randomly and neither does the number of doctors). By using spline regression, the authors do not take the auto correlated structure of the data into account. Based on this, a high risk of bias should be allocated to this domain. However, following re-analysis (based on figure 1) is performed that take autocorrelation into account the risk of bias assessment can remain as low. A spline-regression analysis was used to detect a structural change in the Gini coefficients due to external programme intervention over time, such as policy changes. Spline regression uses the polynomial term for capturing non-linear changes along with the introducing of the policy. Since NHI was implemented to cover the entire healthcare system in Taiwan, all the relevant parties within the healthcare system needed a substantial period of time to adjust into the NHI scheme. In the spline regression analysis in this study, they used 0 for the variable NHI<SUB>t</SUB> before 1995, and 1-8 after 1995 to capture potential non-linear structural change after the implementation of NHI. A year-specific time trend variable denoted by the term T<SUB>t</SUB> was included in the model to account for other confounding socioeconomic factors in the wider society over the 3-decade time period.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This refers to a priori hypotheses about the direction of the intercept (immediate level change) and slope (trend) effects at the time of the intervention/policy and the nature of slope parameter (e.g. linear, polynomial, etc.). That is, the investigators should state explicitly that the intervention was intended to produce (or not) an immediate change in the outcome of interest (positive or negative) or that the effect would increase/decrease over time, or both.</P>
<P>The authors did not specifically state how they felt the implementation of the NHI would affect the outcome of interest. However, the authors did state that any changes occurring as a result of the intervention would be gradual and this was accounted for in the analyses and the variables included in the analyses.</P>
<P>The criterion regarding the "point of analysis" is critical. Usually the inflection point ("interruption") is specified when the intervention begins; however, investigators often allow for a "ramp up" period where the observations around the intervention are censored in order to measure the effect of the intervention when it reaches "full strength". If a ramp up period is used in the analysis then this should be carefully explained and justified.</P>

<TD>
<P>That students with a rural origin are more likely to practice in a rural setting is a consistent finding in several observational studies. It appears to be the single factor most strongly associated with rural practice. Some studies found that the spouse's background is as important as that of the health professional as a predictor of practice location.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>Men are more likely to practice rural medicine than women is a consistent finding in several observational studies. This finding may change if more accommodating conditions are created for women in these areas. It is important to have female rural doctors in culturally sensitive settings.</P>

<TD>
<P>Students whose intent at study entry is to practice rural medicine are more likely to do so.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Students who expressed an intention at study entry to practice rural medicine found independently predict rural practice in the Physician Shortage Areas Program, but 60% of rural doctors in the US reported no such career intention initially.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Students who report involvement in volunteer activities are more likely to practice rural medicine.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In 1 study conducted at the University of North Carolina it was observed that the students who report involvement in volunteer activities were more likely to become generalists; however, this did not necessarily translate to them practicing in rural areas.</P>

<TD>
<P>Emphasising the importance of rural health issues influences medical students to consider rural practice.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Exposing undergraduate students to health care in underserved areas is important to their overall training and development; it would an added bonus if it is found to encourage them to work in an underserved area subsequently.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Clinical rotation in a rural setting influences medical students to consider rural practice.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Observational studies have shown that actual clinical exposure (immersion) may be important, although the perceived impact of rural rotations may be biased by self selection (i.e. those students who do rural rotations would have chosen to do so prior to the intervention).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>The availability of generalist fellowships encourages more doctors to enter rural practice.</P>
<P>Undergraduate students from medical schools that offer generalist fellowships are more likely to become rural doctors.</P>

<TD>
<P>Rural health specialists and family physicians may be more likely to enter rural practice, but there is no evidence that the creation/availability of these specialities actually reduces the rural urban maldistribution.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Students from medical schools located in rural areas are more likely to practice in a rural setting.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>There is limited but consistent evidence that rural medical schools produce more rural doctors. However, rural placement may be a surrogate of various other factors, such as rural origin or likelihood to marry someone of rural origin. The establishment of more rural medical schools or satellite campuses warrant further evaluation.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>This particular intervention has shown variable success in different countries. Furthermore, these strategies are dependent on the availability of funds to provide scholarships and rural allowances to health-care professionals working in underserved areas. The long-term benefit and cost effectiveness of these strategies requires further investigation.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Providing direct financial incentives encourages rural practice.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In Canada, allowing higher fees in rural areas is believed to have had a positive influence on general practitioner distribution.<BR/>Reports from low- and middle-income countries have also been positive. The sustainability of these strategies is dependent on the availability of funds to provide scholarships and rural allowances to health-care professionals working in underserved areas and the long-term benefit and cost effectiveness of these strategies requires further investigation.</P>

</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Requiring that recently qualified doctors perform 'community service' in underserved areas will reduce maldistribution.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Forced 'community service' addresses short-term recruitment, but there is concern that it may alienate people from long-term rural practice. This strategy should be adopted with great caution as newly graduated medical students are often ill equipped to deal with the lack of professional and personal support in underserved areas. Some may be able to cope but in the absence of adequate guidance and support many have negative experiences that alienate them from future rural practice.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Requiring that doctors spend a minimum number of years in an underserved area before allowing them to specialise will reduce maldistribution.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This intervention has been applied in a number of low- and middle-income countries. It has been criticised in Indonesia for attracting the "wrong type" of doctor to rural areas and for reducing the return on investment placed in specialised training.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Recruiting foreign doctors and limiting them to rural practice will address staff shortages in these areas.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Recruitment of foreign doctors is widely practiced. It does offer a short-term solution to importing countries, but may worsen global health professional distribution patterns. Long-term retention of foreign doctors in underserved areas remains poor. However, there is a need to respect the right of healthcare professionals to enter the global labour market like any other professional; failure to do so may have a negative impact on those considering health care as a profession.</P>

<P>Providing sufficient professional support encourages rural practice.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>There is some evidence from questionnaire-based surveys supporting this hypothesis. Healthcare professionals need continuous professional stimulation. Attendance at conferences and supporting local academic activities may assist them to keep up to date with new medical developments.</P>

<TD>
<P>Providing sufficient personal support encourages rural practice.</P>

<LI>Interrupted time series study</LI>
<LI>Apart from the risk of bias inherent in interrupted time series studies (high risk of selection bias and whether or not the effect is due to the intervention), it was a well-conducted study.</LI>
<LI>Data from one study conducted in one country. Results may not be generalizable or transferable to other settings.</LI>
<LI>Very low: This research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different (a large enough difference that it might affect a decision) is very high.</LI>
