<P>Diet is an important determinant of chronic disease risk, particularly heart disease. This review assessed the effects of providing dietary advice to healthy adults in order to produce sustained improvements in their diets. Whether dietary improvement would reduce the risk factors associated with heart disease was also examined. We found 44 trials in which healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive dietary advice or no dietary advice. The dietary improvements recommended to the people in the intervention groups centred largely on the reduction of salt and fat intake and an increase in the intake of fruit, vegetables and fibre. Advice was delivered in a variety of ways, including one-to-one contact, group sessions and written materials. There were variations in intensity of the intervention, ranging from one contact per study participant to 50 hours of counselling over four years. The duration of the trials ranged from three months to four years, with a median follow-up period of 12 months. There was some evidence of greater effectiveness in people told that they were at risk of heart disease or cancer. Modest improvements were shown in cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure and total and LDL-cholesterol levels. In the trials that separated effects by gender, women tended to make larger reductions in fat intake but there was insufficient evidence to show whether this translated to a larger reduction in total cholesterol levels. Two trials followed people up 10 to 15 years after the end of the trials and showed that the beneficial changes in cardiovascular risk factors may have resulted in a reduced incidence of heart disease, stroke or heart attack, although more evidence is needed to confirm this.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the HTA database on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 4, 2010). We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to week 2 October 2010) and EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 42 2010). Additional searches were done on CAB Health (1972 to December 1999), CVRCT registry (2000), CCT (2000) and SIGLE (1980 to 2000). Dissertation abstracts and reference lists of articles were checked and researchers were contacted.</P>

<P>Forty-four trials with 52 intervention arms (comparisons) comparing dietary advice with no advice were included in the review; 18,175 participants or clusters were randomised. Twenty-nine of the 44 included trials were conducted in the USA. Dietary advice reduced total serum cholesterol by 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.23) and LDL cholesterol by 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.08 to 0.24) after 3 to 24 months. Mean HDL cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels were unchanged. Dietary advice reduced blood pressure by 2.61 mm Hg systolic (95% CI 1.31 to 3.91) and 1.45 mm Hg diastolic (95% CI 0.68 to 2.22) and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion by 40.9 mmol (95% CI 25.3 to 56.5) after 3 to 36 months but there was heterogeneity between trials for the latter outcome. Three trials reported plasma antioxidants, where small increases were seen in lutein and &#946;-cryptoxanthin, but there was heterogeneity in the trial effects. Self-reported dietary intake may be subject to reporting bias, and there was significant heterogeneity in all the following analyses. Compared to no advice, dietary advice increased fruit and vegetable intake by 1.18 servings/day (95% CI 0.65 to 1.71). Dietary fibre intake increased with advice by 6.5 g/day (95% CI 2.2 to 10.82), while total dietary fat as a percentage of total energy intake fell by 4.48% (95% CI 2.47 to 6.48) with dietary advice, and saturated fat intake fell by 2.39% (95% CI 1.4 to 3.37).</P>
<P>Two trials analysed incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (TOHP I/II). Follow-up was 77% complete at 10 to 15 years after the end of the intervention period and estimates of event rates lacked precision but suggested that sodium restriction advice probably led to a reduction in cardiovascular events (combined fatal plus non-fatal events) plus revascularisation (TOHP I hazards ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.08; TOHP II HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12).<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-23 23:45:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dietary change is an important component of any strategy to achieve population level reductions in the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2007</LINK>) have considered the effectiveness of different aspects of dietary intake on the level of cardiovascular risk. However, an important question is how individuals and communities can be encouraged and supported to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease by making changes in their diet.</P>
<P>Public health policy in the UK and elsewhere advocates dietary change as a means to improve population health (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>). There remains some uncertainty about whether dietary advice given to healthy individuals is effective in achieving change (<LINK REF="REF-FHSG-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">FHSG 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1991</LINK>). In this review we aimed to quantify the impact of dietary advice given to healthy, free living adults and to identify factors that influence the effectiveness of dietary advice. We have excluded weight reduction trials because although obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a major public health problem, other systematic reviews which address obesity are registered with Cochrane Review groups (for example <LINK REF="REF-Curioni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curioni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flodgren-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flodgren 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Halloran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Halloran 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oude-Luttikhuis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oude Luttikhuis 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waters-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2011</LINK>) and other health technology research organisations (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2004</LINK>). We have also excluded trials involving supplementation, free foods or drinks or financial inducements because we are interested in the effects of advice rather than other interventions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dietary factors in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)</HEADING>
<P>Dietary pattern is an important determinant of chronic disease risk and overall mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Knoops-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knoops 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trichopoulou-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trichopoulou 2005</LINK>). Although drug treatment, such as lipid-lowering with statins, may be appropriate among individuals at high risk of CVD (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 2009</LINK>), adoption of a healthy diet is preferable to long-term medication in the general population in order to prevent or delay the onset of disease and to reduce the burden on health services.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dietary advice to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)</HEADING>
<P>Advice that encourages consumption of a diet that is relatively lower in any one or more of fat, saturated fatty acids, cholesterol or sodium; or relatively higher in any one of fruit, vegetables, polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, fish, fibre or potassium is likely to reduce the risk of CVD and certain cancers (<LINK REF="REF-COMA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HSS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In almost all developed countries, intake of salt and saturated fat are undesirably high and should be reduced, while increases in intake of poly- and mono-unsaturated fats and fruit and vegetables are needed (for example <LINK REF="REF-Dietary-Guidelines-for-Americans-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FSA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2006</LINK>). Dietary advice can take many forms, including verbal or written, single or multiple contacts with individuals or groups, and may be delivered by health professionals or other agencies such as fitness consultants, trade unions or commercial organisations. The present review was concerned with trials of the effect of such advice in healthy European, North American, Australasian and Japanese populations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">How dietary advice might work</HEADING>
<P>Dietary change has been shown to modify risk. For example, changes in the quantity and quality of dietary fat improve the lipid profile (<LINK REF="REF-Mensink-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mensink 1992</LINK>) and blood pressure is lowered by reducing sodium intake (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004a</LINK>) and increasing potassium intake (<LINK REF="REF-Cappuccio-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappuccio 1991</LINK>). These findings are based on trials involving well-motivated individuals, often in metabolic wards (<LINK REF="REF-Mensink-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mensink 1992</LINK>), living in institutions (<LINK REF="REF-Dayton-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayton 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frantz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frantz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turpeinen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turpeinen 1979</LINK>) or receiving treatment in a hospital clinic (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk versus population strategies</HEADING>
<P>Individuals found to be at high risk of CVD may have the motivation to make large changes in their dietary intake, although in practice such changes may be difficult for an individual to achieve, even in environments where healthy eating is the norm, and the changes may be difficult to maintain. More importantly, dietary changes in a minority of high risk individuals will have little effect on the overall population burden of cardiovascular disease. Rose has elegantly demonstrated how it is only changes in the overall population levels of total blood cholesterol level, for example, that can achieve a significant reduction in the population level burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1993</LINK>). More recently, Barton and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Barton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 2011</LINK>) have demonstrated, using a spread sheet model, that small population shifts in mean intake of salt or in mean level of total cholesterol concentration would result in considerable reductions in cardiovascular events and very large savings to the health service in the UK. There are a variety of fiscal and legislative interventions that might be employed to change a population&#8217;s diet (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>), but they are outside the scope of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Dietary change is an alternative to long-term statin and other medication for reducing cardiovascular risk among healthy people. There is plentiful evidence that risk factor reduction using statins and blood pressure lowering drugs cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke among two broad groups. Those who have existing vascular disease (for secondary prevention) and those who are healthy but at high risk (for primary prevention) are likely to experience benefit from drug treatment that far outweighs the harms (<LINK REF="REF-HPS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2011</LINK>). However, among healthy people at low risk there is less evidence that benefits exceed harms with long-term drug-based risk factor lowering. Recent systematic reviews differ in their interpretation of this evidence, suggesting on one hand that caution should be exercised in prescribing statins to individuals at low cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2011</LINK>) and on the other hand that most people if not everyone over age 50 years, regardless of their cholesterol and blood pressure levels, are likely to benefit from drug treatment (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2009</LINK>). Trials of statin therapy in the largest systematic review to date have a median duration of five years (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT 2012</LINK>), whereas advocates of long-term treatment suggest that many millions should take a statin daily for some 50 years. While It might turn out that the mass-medication strategy is effective with respect to cardiovascular disease prevention across the whole risk factor distribution, and has no downside, there may be many who will opt for behaviour change rather than daily medication for various reasons, if given a balanced and evidence-based choice.</P>
<P>This review addresses the important question of the effect of dietary advice among healthy people. Dietary advice is one of many strategies available to achieve health-promoting change in dietary patterns in the population (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Flaherty-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Flaherty 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorogood-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorogood 2007</LINK>). The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Brunner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 2007</LINK>) collated 38 trials with 17,871 participants or clusters and found that various modalities of dietary advice appeared to be effective in bringing about modest beneficial changes in diet and cardiovascular risk factors over approximately 10 months. The longer-term effects remained unclear. The present substantive update extends the literature search from November 2006 to October 2010 and adds six further studies plus longer follow-up in one trial. The overall conclusions remain unchanged. The review includes estimates of the effects of intervention-related reductions in serum cholesterol and blood pressure on the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke.</P>

<P>Dietary interventions involve verbal or written advice delivered in person or over the phone to individuals or small groups. The advice could include a combination of such approaches and be given by health professionals or other personnel. Trials could include additional interventions such as posters in a work canteen. We considered trials involving advice to decrease consumption of one or more of fat, saturated fatty acids, cholesterol or salt; or increase consumption of one or more of fruit, vegetables, polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, fish, fibre or potassium; or both. We have restricted this review to interventions involving only advice on diet to minimise confounding. Multiple interventions, such as those involving advice on physical activity, were excluded. Trials of weight reducing diets were excluded. The control group received no or minimal dietary advice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Handsearching and other sources</HEADING>
<P>In the original review and this latest update, bibliographies of systematic reviews addressing food-based dietary interventions relevant to CVD were checked as a source of RCTs. Cochrane Review Groups in areas related to this review include the Diabetes Group, Stroke Group, Renal Group, Hypertension Group and Peripheral Vascular Disease Group. In the original review these groups were contacted and asked to search their trials registers for relevant trials.</P>
<P>Experts in the field were contacted for references to studies not yet identified by the search process. Experts were defined as members of the Cochrane Heart Group, persons who served as an author (not necessarily the primary author) on more than one trial meeting the inclusion criteria for the review, the contact author for any relevant trial or the contact author for any relevant systematic review. No language restrictions were applied and evaluations of all relevant non-English articles were obtained.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>For the original search the titles and then the abstracts of potentially relevant references were read independently by two review authors. Articles were rejected only if both review authors determined from the title or abstract that the article was not a report of a randomised controlled trial; or the trial did not address food-based dietary advice relevant to CVD; or the trial was of less than three months duration; or the intervention was multi-factorial.</P>
<P>The results of the updated searches were checked by one review author to eliminate those studies that were definitely not relevant to the review. Remaining records were independently checked by two review authors. All papers that were thought to be of relevance were obtained and read by two review authors independently. Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in the review using the predetermined inclusion criteria. A proforma was used to determine study inclusion status. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with a third review author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data on participants, interventions, outcomes and trial quality were extracted independently by two review authors using a proforma. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Chief investigators were contacted to provide additional relevant information. Data on potential effect modifiers were abstracted, including the setting of the trial (work site, community, home or healthcare facility), duration of the intervention and the follow-up, intensity of advice giving (number of scheduled contacts) and proportion of participants who were women.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Quality assessment was based on reporting of the randomisation procedure, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment. Allocation concealment (concealing group assignment) was considered adequate if participants were randomised individually after recruitment was complete. Allocation concealment was considered inadequate in cluster randomised trials where all participants at a given location were assigned to the same intervention or control group. Trial personnel and participants in trials of dietary advice, as with other behavioural interventions, cannot be blinded to the nature of the intervention. Where the report of the trial method indicated that outcome measures were determined without knowledge of group assignment, blinding of outcome assessment was considered adequate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of intervention effect</HEADING>
<P>All outcomes were continuously distributed. We compared net differences between baseline and follow-up measurements and calculated the difference in means and 95% confidence interval for each outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). We combined net differences across studies using a random-effects model. Where standard deviation differences were not reported in the source papers, we made allowances for within participant correlation from baseline to follow-up measurements by using the correlation coefficient between the two (see <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK> for details and <LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). In the latest update, data 10 to 15 years after completion of the intervention were available for two trials already included in the review, which now report clinical events (<LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-II" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP II</LINK>). Adjusted hazard ratios were reported for these two trials and we presented the results in narrative form. </P>

If we detected substantial heterogeneity, we looked for possible explanations (for example participants and intervention). Regardless of the magnitude of heterogeneity, where six or more trials provided data for a given outcome the results were grouped according to five potential effect-modifying factors.</P>

<P>In earlier versions of this review, the searches up to the year 2006 generated 45,100 hits. Screening of titles and abstracts identified 299 papers for formal inclusion or exclusion. In the original review 23 trials met the inclusion criteria. When the review was updated in the year 2006, 15 more trials met the inclusion criteria so 38 trials were then included, a substantial increase on the 23 included in the original review. The latest update from the year 2006 to 2010 generated 23,300 further hits, and screening the titles and abstracts identified 306 papers for formal inclusion or exclusion.

<P>Blinding of participants to the intervention was not possible in trials of behavioural advice, however outcome assessment could be conducted by trial personnel without knowledge of group allocation. Primary outcomes in this review were CVD risk factors and biomarkers of dietary intake. With the exception of blood pressure, these outcomes were relatively free of the risk of information bias. There was some indication of blinding in the reports of 13 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-high-fibre" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson high fibre</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-low-fibre" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson low fibre</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beresford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Beresford 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloemberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bloemberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coates-WHT-MP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coates WHT MP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENCORE" TYPE="STUDY">ENCORE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellenius-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hellenius 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maskarinec-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maskarinec 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil-dietitian1995" TYPE="STUDY">Neil dietitian1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil-nurse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Neil nurse 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riddell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Riddell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacerdote-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sacerdote 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Warner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I</LINK>). The secondary outcomes were self-reported measures of dietary intake, commonly based on a food frequency questionnaire.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials were cluster randomised. In one community trial a cross-over design was used such that each site acted as its own control and the site was the unit of analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Havas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1998</LINK>). In a work place trial 41 pairs of employee cliques (informal social networks) were the unit of randomisation and analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Buller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buller 1999</LINK>). In two further work place trials, worksite was the unit of randomisation but data were analysed at the level of the individual. We used the worksite as the denominator for the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Tilley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tilley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I</LINK>). Another worksite trial analysed data at the level of the cluster (<LINK REF="STD-Beresford-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beresford 2006</LINK>). Three trials based in clinics used physician practice as the unit of randomisation but analysed the data at an individual level. Analysis allowed for random effects of clinic and physician practice, with the physician nested within the clinic. We used the physician as the denominator for the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Beresford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Beresford 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Veen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">van der Veen 2002</LINK>). One trial randomised health departments, where analysis was at the individual level, allowing for random effects of the health department (<LINK REF="STD-Ammerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ammerman 2003</LINK>). The denominator used in this review was the health department. Two trials were based in American churches where data were analysed at the individual level taking account of clustering (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuemmeler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fuemmeler 2006</LINK>).

One trial focused on increasing fruit and vegetable intake (<LINK REF="STD-John-2002" TYPE="STUDY">John 2002</LINK>) and the others more broadly on healthy eating advice (<LINK REF="STD-Anderssen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Anderssen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENCORE" TYPE="STUDY">ENCORE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellenius-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hellenius 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacerdote-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sacerdote 2006</LINK>).

The authors kindly provided hazard ratio (HR) for each trial adjusted for clinic, age, sex, race and differences in follow-up. Data from TOHP II were presented for sodium only versus the usual care arm thereby omitting the effects of weight loss. Results from these two trials were presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. There was a reduction in the combined CVD endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularisation or CVD death) with the intervention for both trials, although this did not reach statistical significance (TOHP I HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.08), TOHP II HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.59, 1.12). Estimates were also provided for non-fatal events and CVD mortality separately. There was a reduced risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction with the intervention in TOHP I but not TOHP II (TOHP I HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.95). It was important to note that these data were collected many years after the end of each intervention period for TOHP I and II, and it was unclear how participants may have changed their dietary patterns during this period.</P>

<P>The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence for the sustained effectiveness of dietary advice in adults free of disease.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of main results </HEADING>
<P>The review shows that dietary advice promotes modestly beneficial changes in reported dietary intake (lower salt and fat, higher fibre, and fruit and vegetables) and in some cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol). The trial participants were healthy adults studied for at least three months and up to four years (median duration 12 months). There was some evidence that dietary advice was more effective when individuals were recruited on the basis of increased risk of CVD or cancer, but beneficial changes were obtained when individuals were not screened at recruitment.</P>
<P>Advice to reduce fat intake (total and saturated fatty acids) and to increase dietary fibre, fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a reduction over three to 24 months of follow-up for blood total cholesterol of 0.15 mmol/L and for LDL cholesterol 0.16 mmol/L. Advice to reduce salt intake or reduce fat and increase fruit and vegetable and fibre consumption over three to 36 months of follow-up was associated with a reduction in blood pressure of 2.61 mm Hg systolic and 1.45 mm Hg diastolic. Advice to reduce salt intake was associated with a reduced 24-hour urinary sodium excretion of 40.9 mmol, but there was significant heterogeneity between trials. </P>
<P>Reported fruit and vegetable intake increased by 1.18 servings per day with dietary intervention over six to 48 months of follow-up. Dietary fibre intake increased with intervention over three to 48 months by 6.5 g per day. Reported total dietary fat intake expressed as a percentage of total calorie intake fell by 4.48% with the intervention over three to 48 months. The corresponding reduction in saturated fatty acid intake was 2.39%.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>More than 10,000 randomised individuals or clusters contributed data to most of the outcomes discussed in this review, including the 'objective' outcomes blood cholesterol, blood pressure and urinary sodium output. For total dietary fat and fruit and vegetable intake this number was approximately 14,800. There was a lack of evidence in relation to plasma triglycerides and folate. Since the search for the original review to the year 2000, three new trials measuring plasma antioxidants have been included, with over 700 participants randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Djuric-combination" TYPE="STUDY">Djuric combination</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djuric-high-F_x0026_V" TYPE="STUDY">Djuric high F&amp;V</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-John-2002" TYPE="STUDY">John 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 2001</LINK>). Small changes were seen with the intervention for lutein and &#946;-cryptoxanthin but there was heterogeneity in the trial effects. With the advent of new trials, evidence for changes in plasma antioxidants with dietary advice will be more complete.</P>
<P>Dietary changes are effective in modifying risk when adherence is high, but there has been uncertainty about the effects of giving advice to healthy adults. Trials involving well-motivated individuals being fed controlled diets in metabolic wards (<LINK REF="REF-Mensink-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mensink 1992</LINK>), institutions (<LINK REF="REF-Dayton-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayton 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frantz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frantz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turpeinen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turpeinen 1979</LINK>), or the community (<LINK REF="REF-Appel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 1997</LINK>) do not assess the real-world effect of dietary advice. This review assembles the evidence that dietary advice is effective in less selected participants drawn from communities and work places.</P>
<P>A number of gaps in the evidence of the effects of dietary advice are apparent in the studies identified to date. In the original review (searching to year 2000) it was noted that there was a lack of high quality trials of cholesterol lowering by diet among unscreened healthy adults. Since this time, several trials have been published and included in the review, one based in the UK showing no effect of the intervention on cholesterol levels (<LINK REF="STD-John-2002" TYPE="STUDY">John 2002</LINK>), three based in the US showing effects in the desirable direction in one trial but not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2003</LINK>), and no effect of the intervention in the remaining two (<LINK REF="STD-Ammerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ammerman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENCORE" TYPE="STUDY">ENCORE</LINK>). A further trial from Norway showed a reduction in total cholesterol with dietary advice but this did not reach statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-Anderssen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Anderssen 2007</LINK>). In addition, we found no evidence from countries other than the USA of the effect of cholesterol lowering dietary interventions provided outside healthcare settings. This is surprising, given the importance of population cholesterol levels for cardiovascular disease prevention, but in part reflects the narrow inclusion criteria used in this review. Speculatively, it may be more efficient to provide dietary advice together with other forms of healthy eating promotion in the community or work place (<LINK REF="REF-Thorogood-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorogood 2007</LINK>). We did not identify trials meeting the inclusion criteria that used quality of life outcomes or economic evaluation.</P>
<P>Five US trials (11,427 participants) provided evidence of the effect of dietary advice, limited to dietary fat and fruit and vegetable intake, among low income women (<LINK REF="STD-Coates-WHT-MP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coates WHT MP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1998</LINK>) and blue collar workers (<LINK REF="STD-Buller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tilley 1999</LINK>). One trial showed a large reduction in fat intake at six months among minority ethnic group and low socioeconomic class women (<LINK REF="STD-Coates-WHT-MP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coates WHT MP 1999</LINK>). The two trials involving American, predominantly male, blue collar workers were not effective in increasing fruit and vegetable intake at six months (<LINK REF="STD-Buller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buller 1999</LINK>) or two years (<LINK REF="STD-Tilley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tilley 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there are 12 trials of advice to increase fruit and vegetable intake among unscreened healthy adults, only two were based outside the USA (<LINK REF="STD-John-2002" TYPE="STUDY">John 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacerdote-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sacerdote 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall quality, strength and consistency of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The majority of trials were conducted in the USA (29 trials). Most trials involved individual randomisation (33). There were 11 cluster randomised trials, eight were based in the USA, three in work places, three in healthcare settings and two in community centres, and one was based in a healthcare setting in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Veen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">van der Veen 2002</LINK>). To limit selection bias we restricted loss to follow-up to 20% and as a consequence data from shorter follow-up periods often had to be utilised for the longer duration trials. Descriptions of the trials, including methods used in randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, were in general poor in comparison with the CONSORT recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Only four of the individually randomised trials and one of the cluster randomised trials showed evidence of adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes (blood pressure, lipids and other biomarkers) used in this review are broadly free of information bias. For urinary sodium output, short-term salt restriction, or over-compliance bias, before the follow-up urine sample may have been large enough to contribute to the large observed intervention effect. The four trials with both blood pressure and urinary sodium measures showed some evidence of inconsistency in that large reductions in sodium output in two trials of salt restriction (<LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-II" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP II</LINK>) were not associated with large reductions in blood pressure. A further trial of salt restriction (<LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1990</LINK>) was small and of short (three months) duration. Conversely, large reductions in blood pressure and small changes in urinary sodium were found in the remaining trial where the intervention was not solely salt restriction (<LINK REF="STD-ENCORE" TYPE="STUDY">ENCORE</LINK>). </P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were based on self-reported dietary intakes. Some of the intervention effects assessed by self-report were substantial and may in part reflect information (reporting) bias, either on the part of participants or the trial personnel responsible for coding and analysing diet questionnaires. A particular weakness of the trial reports in this review is the absent or poor description of blinding of assessors to group allocation. Information bias may explain in part the discrepant findings for vitamin C, the only outcome measured both by self-report and biomarker. Intake assessed by self-report was found to increase substantially in response to the intervention, whereas the corresponding effect assessed by a plasma ascorbate assay was not significant. Self-reported outcomes (and associated problems of recall bias) are more likely to show increases than biomarkers but, given the heterogeneity in all outcomes, it is difficult to make further comment.</P>
<P>Weight loss during the trials may potentially confound changes in dietary composition indexed by blood pressure and blood cholesterol. We excluded studies that had weight loss as a main aim; however weight loss as a consequence of the recommended dietary alteration could add to the apparent effect of dietary change by causing temporary reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol. Twenty-four of the 33 individually randomised trial reports provided information on initial weight and weight loss and this was reassuring. Net mean weight loss in these intervention groups during the trials was in the range of 0 to 1.8 kg for 22 trials, but was more substantial in the remaining two at 2.7 kg (<LINK REF="STD-Beckman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Beckman 1995</LINK>) and 5.2 kg (<LINK REF="STD-Anderssen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Anderssen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions varied considerably in terms of the nature of the dietary advice. Three main groups are evident, those giving broad healthy eating advice that followed consensus guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-COMA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HSS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSS 2005</LINK>) on fat, fibre, fruit and vegetables (<LINK REF="STD-Ammerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ammerman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderssen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Anderssen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-high-fibre" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson high fibre</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-low-fibre" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson low fibre</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baron-men-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Baron men 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baron-women-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Baron women 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beresford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Beresford 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloemberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bloemberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brekke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brekke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djuric-combination" TYPE="STUDY">Djuric combination</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djuric-high-F_x0026_V" TYPE="STUDY">Djuric high F&amp;V</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-promotora" TYPE="STUDY">Elder promotora</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elder-tailored" TYPE="STUDY">Elder tailored</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENCORE" TYPE="STUDY">ENCORE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuemmeler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fuemmeler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellenius-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hellenius 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-WHTV-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson WHTV 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little--2004" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil-dietitian1995" TYPE="STUDY">Neil dietitian1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil-nurse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Neil nurse 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacerdote-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sacerdote 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schatzkin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schatzkin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takahashi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Takahashi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tilley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Veen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">van der Veen 2002</LINK>); those focused on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption along the lines of '5-a-day' campaigns (<LINK REF="STD-Beresford-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beresford 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-John-2002" TYPE="STUDY">John 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lutz--non_x002d_tailored" TYPE="STUDY">Lutz non-tailored</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lutz-tailored-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lutz tailored 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lutz--tailored_x0026_goals" TYPE="STUDY">Lutz tailored&amp;goals</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maskarinec-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maskarinec 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Warner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-work_x002b_family" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen work+family</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-worksite" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen worksite</LINK>); and those that emphasised salt restriction (<LINK REF="STD-Beckman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Beckman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koopman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Silman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-II" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP II</LINK>). Another trial aimed to reduce fat consumption to 20% of energy or less among low income women (<LINK REF="STD-Coates-WHT-MP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coates WHT MP 1999</LINK>) and another aimed to increase folate rich food consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Riddell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Riddell 2000</LINK>). The trials involving broad healthy eating advice were consistent in their modest effects on blood total cholesterol reduction. The two Women's Health Trials (<LINK REF="STD-Coates-WHT-MP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Coates WHT MP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-WHTV-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson WHTV 1990</LINK>) achieved very large reductions in dietary fat intake, but blood cholesterol was not measured. Trial interventions that advised an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption obtained similar increases in intake, with the exception of two that obtained much larger reported effects among participants presumably motivated by awareness of their increased risk of colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Schatzkin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schatzkin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Warner 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intervention varied considerably among the included trials in terms of the mode of delivery of the dietary advice. Our subgroup analysis of the effect of intensity, based on the frequency of scheduled contacts, provide some evidence that higher intensity intervention is associated with larger dietary changes, particularly for dietary fat intake and total cholesterol. Lower intensity interventions are more likely to be adopted in routine health care. There was heterogeneity in the effects within the subgroup of high intensity trials largely due to those with participants at increased cancer risk (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-WHTV-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson WHTV 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schatzkin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schatzkin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith_x002d_Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Smith-Warner 2000</LINK>). We expected to find that the effect of the intervention would decline with duration of the trial. There was no evidence that this was the case when comparing longer duration trials with follow-up at 12 months or more with those of shorter duration.</P>
<P>Of the 44 trials with 52 intervention arms meeting the inclusion criteria, 22 (24 intervention arms, 8835 participants or clusters randomised) recruited participants without some form of screening to identify people at elevated risk of disease compared to the general population. By design, participants were predominantly free of diagnosed chronic disease and not taking lipid-lowering or hypotensive medication, but there was evidence of a greater effect of advice in the trials with increased cancer risk participants. This may be a sign of greater motivation among these participants compared with those in healthy population trials, and it may be that some of the effects reported here would be smaller for dietary advice offered to a healthy population.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>Two aspects of selection bias are relevant to this review. First, our decision was to restrict the review to trials of dietary intervention alone to avoid the potential confounding effects due to other behavioural interventions, such as exercise advice, on our primary outcomes. The effect of this restriction may also be to overestimate the effectiveness of dietary advice if in practice it is given simultaneously with other health-promotion interventions. Second, we decided to limit dropout to 20% or less to avoid selection bias in effect estimation rather than to perform sensitivity analysis to examine the consequences of varying dropout rates. The effect of this restriction has been to exclude a number of well-known trials with a relatively high dropout rate (for example <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HPTR-1990" TYPE="STUDY">HPTR 1990</LINK>). In addition, we may be biasing our findings by limiting our evidence to trials with conscientious participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews </HEADING>
<P>Two Cochrane reviews have examined interventions to reduce blood pressure in normotensive people. One studied the efficacy of reduced sodium intake rather than the effectiveness of advice to reduce sodium intake, and hence selected only trials that showed a reduction in sodium excretion of at least 40 mmol/24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-He-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2004</LINK>). The authors found a median reduction in normotensive people of 74 mmol/24 hours that was associated with a fall of 2.03 mm Hg (95% CI -2.56 to 1.50) in systolic and 0.99 mm Hg (95% CI -1.40 to 0.57) in diastolic pressure. Another Cochrane review included trials of interventions aimed at sodium reduction, of at least six months duration (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004a</LINK>). Three trials in normotensives were identified giving a mean reduction in sodium excretion of 35 mmol/24 hours (95% CI -47.2 to 23.9) and a mean reduction of systolic pressure of 1.1mm Hg (95% CI -1.8 to 0.4) and of diastolic pressure of 0.6 mm Hg (95% CI -1.5 to 0.3). The fall in sodium excretion is compatible with our findings of a fall in sodium excretion of 40.9 mmol/24 hours (95% CI 25.3 to 56.5). However, we have found a slightly larger effect on blood pressure with a fall in systolic pressure of 2.61 mm Hg (95% CI 1.31 to 3.91) and diastolic pressure of 1.45 mm Hg (95% CI 0.68 to 2.22). Hooper et al concluded that "resulting falls of 1.1 mm Hg systolic and 0.6 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure may be useful at a population level; however the intensity of intervention applied to individuals required to achieve this is not realistic for community control of high blood pressure". In our review, two large studies targeting salt reduction (<LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-II" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP II</LINK>) and a smaller trial of healthy eating advice (<LINK REF="STD-ENCORE" TYPE="STUDY">ENCORE</LINK>) involved intensive interventions whereas the remaining eight studies involved low intensity interventions. In subgroup analysis there was no evidence of an effect of intervention intensity on outcome although there was heterogeneity in the trial effects possibly reflecting the different intervention types. Given that the evidence of effectiveness of low intensity interventions is limited, and given the importance of processed food as a source of sodium, we agree with Hooper et al that "changes in food production and catering practices" are needed (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004a</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2012</LINK>) examined the effectiveness of interventions to reduce dietary fat but has focused on mortality and cardiovascular events and not changes in lipid levels, although these were included as tertiary outcomes. Within healthcare, a Cochrane review has assessed the effects of dietary advice given by a dietitian compared with other health professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2003</LINK>), concluding that dietitians were better than doctors at lowering blood cholesterol but not other diet-related outcomes, in the short to medium term.</P>

<P>We made estimates of the effects of reductions in serum cholesterol and blood pressure on the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke. Based on a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of statins in primary prevention with a mean duration of five years, a reduction of 1.0 mmol/L in serum LDL cholesterol will reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or coronary death (major CHD) by approximately 23% and fatal or non-fatal stroke by 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). The corresponding effects of a blood pressure reduction of 10 mm Hg systolic and 5 mm Hg diastolic, in trials of mean duration 4.5 years, are a 21% reduction in major CHD and a 46% reduction in stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2009</LINK>). Applying these estimates to our summary effects, dietary intervention may reduce major CHD incidence by 11% (4% due to cholesterol lowering) and stroke by 19% (3% due to cholesterol lowering). The estimates assume that the observed changes in dietary habits are sustained for five years and that the reductions in risk attributable to the changes in cholesterol and blood pressure can be combined additively.</P>
<P>Our review suggests that people without the motivation stimulated by a clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease are likely to make modest changes in their intake of individual nutrients and related risk factors in response to dietary advice. When aggregated across the entire dietary pattern, however, several small changes in food habits may lead to greater health gains than the above estimates would suggest. In support of this view, the Lyon Diet Heart trial of a Mediterranean-type diet obtained a reduction of more than 50%, compared to the control group, in the recurrence of fatal and non-fatal CVD over four years of study (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lorgeril-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lorgeril 1999</LINK>). Further, adopting a healthy dietary pattern early in life is likely to maximise the benefits of reduced exposure to adverse vascular risk factors. In the Bogalusa study (USA) of 10-year olds, fat intake was correlated with blood cholesterol levels and sodium intake with systolic blood pressure<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>The public health significance of national dietary patterns is substantial. Here we have assembled the evidence on the effectiveness of dietary advice given to individuals and small groups in a variety of settings. The review shows that brief interventions are modestly effective in reducing blood lipid levels, blood pressure and dietary fat intake, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Variation in the nature and combination of the messages given across the included studies meant that it was not possible to identify 'best advice'. The extent of dietary change is influenced by the intensity and duration of intervention, and by perceived disease risk. There appears to be little if any gain in effectiveness by locating health promotion in primary care in contrast to work places and other non-healthcare settings. Brief dietary interventions aimed at the whole population are likely to produce health gain; however, the workload and cost to the UK National Health Service and other healthcare systems requires careful assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Brunner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-24 05:54:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Questions remain about the most effective way to promote dietary change among healthy adults. Systematic research is needed on the effectiveness of non-individualised modes of dietary health promotion at the population and community level (<LINK REF="REF-Thorogood-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorogood 2007</LINK>). There is a shortage of evidence on the effectiveness of minimal interventions, and their specific components, to promote dietary change in UK healthcare and other settings. High quality trials with follow-up for one year or more are notably sparse. Trials utilising quality of life outcomes or cost-effectiveness evaluation are lacking. If health promotion is targeted in deprived areas (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>) with a high proportion of minority ethnic groups, it may be that dietary change will depend as much on wider determinants, particularly access and availability of healthy foods (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2004</LINK>), as it will on information and motivation.</P>

<P>Cluster RCT in rural North Carolina, USA. County health department was the unit of randomisation. Randomisation was stratified by region (East/West) because of known demographic differences. All comparisons between study groups controlled for randomisation by health department by using mixed-effects linear models. This approach adjusts for any lack of independence among observations from patients within each health department. Analysis was at individual level, allowing for random effects of the health department. The denominator used in this review is the health department.</P>

<P>Participants with untreated hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt;180mg/dL if checked in the last year), aged 20-70 years, resident in the community and contactable by phone. Excluded participants on treatment for hypercholesterolemia (defined as taking lipid lowering medication or more than 2 diet counselling sessions by a health professional in the last 6 months), severe medical conditions, inability to speak or comprehend English. Participants were recruited from county health departments, there were 8 clusters (216 participants) in the intervention group, 9 clusters (252 participants) in the comparison group.

<P>Food for Heart Programme. All participants had a dietary risk assessment using a validated FFQ, the primary goals were to reduce the consumption of saturated fat and increase consumption of fruit and vegetables and complex carbohydrates. The programme comprised 3 counselling visits from public health nurses using the Food for Heart Programme - a theory based dietary assessment and tailored counselling programme for lower income patients with high cholesterol. The intervention used the dietary risk assessments, illustrated goal sheets, educational pamphlets and a southern style cookbook. Visits took place at 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 months. Due to &gt;20% loss to follow-up at 6 and 12 months data is only used in this review for 3 months follow-up. After 3 months if cholesterol was still high participants were referred to a nutritionalist and at 6 months there was further re-inforcement with phone calls and newsletters. The comparison group received a minimal intervention which comprised a dietary risk assessment by public health nurses and the nurses were instructed to provide counselling for high cholesterol as they usually do. The cluster design ensured the groups were not contaminated. </P>

The spacing out of individual components was determined by the advisory boards for each RO appropriate for each RO climate. The intervention was targeted at the primary food preparer in each household, but all intervention components were made available to the entire RO membership. The intervention period was 9 months with follow-up at 12 months. The control ROs received the intervention after 12 months. </P>

Dietician performed group counselling (3-11 participants/group with members of household who prepare food), sessions lasted 1-2 hours. There were 2 dietary education sessions 1-2 weeks apart at the beginning of the study. During the 16 week intervention period there was intensive follow-up with unannounced phone calls every 10 days (8 calls per person). Control group participants received a letter informing them to continue with their usual lifestyle. Follow-up was at 2 years.

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>2x2x2 factorial design: no booklet or booklet, no advice to use low salt or advice to use low salt, no use of prompts or use of healthy lifestyle prompts. We excluded the booklet intervention as it was multifactorial (advice to reduce smoking, alcohol and weight as appropriate and exercise regularly). We also excluded the healthy lifestle prompts alone as loss to follow-up was &gt;20% for this intervention. Our analysis focused on the prompts plus low salt intervention with no intervention as the comparison group. Participants were given a pot of low sodium salt and asked to use it in cooking and on food in place of normal salt. The healthy lifestyle prompts included a fatty food swap sheet where participants were asked to swap foods listed in one column with lower fat foods from the other column. Participants were asked to take the sheet with them when shopping and place it in a prominent postion at home such as the fridge door. Fruit, vegetable and fibre daily prompt sheets gave options to increase consumption of these. The intervention(s) were administered by research nurses in GP surgeries. Interventions were reinforced at 4 weeks and 6 months. Control participants received no intervention. Follow-up was at 6 months.</P>

Participants were given a "fat allowance" based on intake at baseline, current lifestyle and willingness to change. Participants were taught how to read food labels and use a fat counter to monitor and record total daily fat intake and negotiated their fat intake up or down with the nurse in counselling sessions. Physicians of siblings in the intervention group were asked explicitly not to manage dietary interventions. Participants in the usual care group were referred to physicians for dietary management.

The second counselling session (45 mins) 2-3 weeks later focused on the goal participants had not chosen at the first session. Telephone support was given 2-3 weeks after the second session and again 2-3 weeks later (5-10 mins each). Participants randomised to the control arm received an intervention focused on breast self examination where individuals received one counselling session and 2 follow-up phone calls but no dietary recommendations. Follow-up was at 12 months.</P>

<P>Stage matched nutrition counselling performed by GPs with selective referral to dieticians if patients reached the action stage (stages of change model). In precontemplation counselling is aimed at raising consiousness about dietary behaviour and on motivation to change dietary behaviour in the contemplation stage. Individuals met with the GP on 3 occasions 2 weeks apart for approximately 10 minutes. If participants reached the action stage and were referred to the dietician there were 3 appointments - the first was 30-40 minutes, the other 2 were 10-15 minutes, appointments were 2-8 weeks apart. Counselling focused on decreasing saturated fat intake and was tailored to the individual. Participants in the control group received usual care. Follow-up was at 12 months.</P>
