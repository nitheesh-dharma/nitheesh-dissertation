<P>Long-term effects of muscle paralysing drugs on newborns needing mechanical ventilation are as yet unclear. </P>
<P>When newborn infants develop breathing difficulties, they need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. Sometimes they do not breathe in rhythm with the ventilator but 'fight' the ventilator, causing bleeding in the brain or serious lung injuries. Treating distress or pain caused by the ventilator and adjusting the ventilator to the infant's own breathing pattern can help. Paralysing newborn infants with muscle relaxing drugs such as pancuronium also stops them fighting the ventilator. However, the review of trials found that, although there seems to be some advantage regarding bleeding in the brain, long term effects of this method are not clear. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:33:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ventilated newborn infants breathing in asynchrony with the ventilator are potentially exposed to more severe barotrauma and are at risk for complications such as pneumothorax or intraventricular haemorrhage. Neuromuscular paralysis, which eliminates the spontaneous breathing efforts of the infant, creates complete synchronization with the ventilator and may minimize these risks. However, complications have been reported with prolonged neuromuscular paralysis in newborn infants.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-28 10:39:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten possibly eligible trials were identified, of which six were included in the review. All the included trials studied preterm infants ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome and used pancuronium as the neuromuscular blocking agent. In the analysis of the results of all trials, no significant difference was found in mortality, air leak or chronic lung disease. There was a significant reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage and a trend towards less severe intraventricular haemorrhages. In the subgroup analysis of trials studying a selected population of ventilated infants with evidence of asynchronous respiratory effort, a significant reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade and severe IVH) was found, and a trend towards less air leak. In the subgroup analysis of trials studying an unselected population of ventilated infants, no significant differences were found for any of the outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-28 10:39:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For ventilated preterm infants with evidence of asynchronous respiratory effort, neuromuscular paralysis with pancuronium seems to have a favourable effect on intraventricular haemorrhage and possibly on pneumothorax. However, uncertainty remains regarding the long-term pulmonary and neurologic effects and the safety of prolonged use of pancuronium in ventilated newborn infants. There is no evidence from randomised trials on the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents other than pancuronium. The routine use of pancuronium or any other neuromuscular blocking agent in ventilated newborn infants cannot be recommended based on current evidence.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-28 10:41:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asynchronous respiratory efforts in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation is a common problem. These infants, "fighting" the ventilator, are at risk for complications during mechanical ventilation which, as a consequence, could impair their clinical outcome. In 1983 Greenough showed that asynchronous spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation was associated with a high risk for pneumothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1983</LINK>). In a prospective study of preterm infants, Perlman showed that fluctuating cerebral blood-flow velocity during the first day of life was associated with an increased risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>); this pattern of cerebral blood-flow is likely to be present in struggling infants. Spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is also associated with higher peak transpulmonary pressures (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1979</LINK>), which may put the infant at higher risk for chronic lung disease due to barotrauma.<BR/>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-28 10:42:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents block neuromuscular transmission at the neuromuscular junction causing paralysis of the affected skeletal muscles. Specifically, non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents block the binding of acetylcholine to its receptors. Commonly used non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents include Vecuronium (Norcuron), Rocuronium (Zemuron), and Pancuronium (Pavulon).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-01 15:04:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neuromuscular blocking agents eliminate the spontaneous breathing efforts of the infant during mechanical ventilation. Potentially, this could reduce the risk for acute complications such as pneumothorax (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>), thereby improving short-term outcome and mortality, and could lead to a more efficient ventilation and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, thereby reducing the risk for lung injury (<LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, a number of complications have been reported with neuromuscular paralysis in infants such as hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1985</LINK>), hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Philips-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philips 1979</LINK>), prolonged muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Torres-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torres 1985</LINK>), joint contractures (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanconi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanconi 1995</LINK>) and, recently, sensorineural hearing loss (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1999</LINK>). Some clinical studies show benefit, whereas other studies show no difference or marked adverse effects of paralysis.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-07-27 17:05:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether routinely paralysing newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared with not routinely paralysing such infants (i.e. either no paralysis at all, or selective paralysis if the infant fails to improve on standard treatment) results in a clinically important reduction in acute pulmonary and neurologic complications during mechanical ventilation and in improvement in long term pulmonary and neurologic outcome. Further, we planned to determine whether routine neuromuscular paralysis in ventilated newborn infants has circulatory or pulmonary adverse effects.</P>
<P>We planned to do the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<P>1. In order to test the hypothesis that neuromuscular paralysis is more effective in the subgroup of newborn infants who are fighting the ventilator, we planned to analyse the subgroup of trials where the study patients were selected at study entry on some evidence of asynchrony with the ventilator, in contrast to the subgroup of trials including all mechanically ventilated newborn infants.</P>
<P>2. To investigate whether routine neuromuscular blockade is more effective in premature infants, who are at risk for chronic lung disease or intracranial haemorrhage or, on the contrary, is more effective in term infants, who are often ventilated for severe diseases such as meconium aspiration or persistent pulmonary hypertension, we planned to analyse the subgroup of trials with study infants with a gestational age of 34 weeks or less, and the subgroup of trials with study infants of more than 34 weeks gestation.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:36:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten possibly eligible trials on the use of neuromuscular blockade in newborn infants were identified. One trial was excluded because no randomisation was used (<LINK REF="STD-Miall_x002d_Allen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Miall-Allen 1987</LINK>). A second trial was excluded because the randomised intervention was the administration of fentanyl versus morphine, whereas neuromuscular blockade was not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Ionides-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ionides 1994</LINK>). In a third excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 1981</LINK>) the investigators studied the infants during two periods of 12 hours, one with and one without muscle relaxation, randomising the order of the two periods in each patient; no clinically relevant or long term outcome measures were studied. Two trials were only published in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bonta 1992</LINK>). The trial by Bancalari including 139 infants was never published in full, but the author provided an unpublished manuscript of the results. The trial used a two by three factorial design testing the effect of both neuromuscular paralysis (paralysis or no paralysis) and mechanical ventilation strategy (three levels of peak inspiratory pressure and inspiratory time). For the purpose of this review, data were extracted pertaining to the main effect of neuromuscular paralysis. Eligibility was assessed and the trial was included in the review. In the study by Bonta 25 infants &lt; 1500 g ventilated for RDS were randomised to either early paralysis or standard paralysis. Until present we have been unable to find more information on this small trial, so it is categorized in this review as "awaiting assessment".</P>
<P>Six randomised, controlled trials, including a total of 486 infants, reported on the effectiveness of neuromuscular paralysis in ventilated newborn infants, and were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>). Except for the trial by Shaw with 193 infants, the trials have a rather small sample size.</P>
<P>There were two possible objectives in those trials: either to compare routine paralysis in the intervention group with no paralysis in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK>), or to compare routine paralysis in the intervention group with selective paralysis in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>). In the second design control infants were allowed to receive neuromuscular blockade only if they met certain criteria. Those criteria reflected a failure to respond to an alternative intervention in the control group. In the study by Quinn the alternative intervention was analgesia with a continuous infusion of morphine. In the study by Shaw mechanical ventilation in the control group was adjusted according to the infant's spontaneous respiration rate by using a higher ventilation rate. In both studies control infants only received pancuronium if they continued to be asynchronous with the ventilator despite the alternative intervention.</P>
<P>Both objectives could be studied either in an unselected population of ventilated newborn infants (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>), or in a selected population of ventilated newborn infants with some evidence of asynchrony with the ventilator (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>). In the first group of trials all mechanically ventilated infants fulfilling the entry criteria were eligible. In the second group of trials ventilated infants were only eligible if they met certain criteria reflecting asynchrony with the ventilator. The method used to assess asynchrony differed from trial to trial. Greenough considered an infant to be actively expiring against artificial ventilation by combining measurements of oesophageal pressure with gas flow measurements into the infant's chest. Perlman assessed cerebral blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery by Doppler flow, considering the infant asynchronous if the pattern of blood flow velocity was fluctuating (coefficient of variation of more than 10%). In the study by Quinn, finally, asynchrony was assessed by clinical evaluation. Ventilated infants who gave the impression of "fighting the ventilator" were considered to be eligible.</P>
<P>Pancuronium was the only drug used as the neuromuscular blocking agent in a dose ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg, repeated in order to maintain paralysis. Neuromuscular blockade was usually continued until mechanical ventilation could be weaned sufficiently (peak pressure &lt; 20 cmH2O or fractional inspired oxygen concentration &lt; 0.40 - 0.45). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>) infants were paralyzed until they were 72 hours old.</P>
<P>The number of control infants receiving pancuronium varied between studies. In the trials comparing routine paralysis with no paralysis the rate of neuromuscular blockade in the control group ranged from 0% (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK>) to 54% (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>). In the study by Greenough all the control infants (11) developed a pneumothorax, whereafter six of them were paralyzed. In the trials comparing routine paralysis with selective paralysis 24% and 26% of the control infants received pancuronium in the studies by Quinn and Shaw respectively.</P>
<P>None of the trials evaluated long-term outcome measures such as neurodevelopment or pulmonary function.</P>

<P>Except for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>), the quality of the trials was generally good.</P>
<P>All trials used randomisation to assign treatment. In four trials allocation was considered to be adequately concealed with the use of sealed envelopes. In one trial the method of randomisation was not described (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>), and in another trial a list of random numbers was used (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>). In the Bancalari trial, the number of infants initially randomised to the paralysis and no paralysis group was unequal (61 for the paralysis group versus 78 for the no paralysis group). The reason for this is not explained in the report, but it might be related to the factorial design of the trial.</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of the caregiver was not possible. In this case, blinding of the outcome assessment, such as interpreting a chest X-ray for interstitial emphysema or ultrasound images for intraventricular haemorrhage, is even more important. In most trials this was unclear. Only in one study it was explicitly stated that interpretation of brain ultrasound was done without knowledge of the patient's treatment status (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>), and in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>) chest X-ray was interpreted by a pediatric radiologist who was unaware of the patient's group assignment.</P>
<P>Completeness of follow-up for the primary outcomes was excellent in all but one trial, ranging from 96% to 100%. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK> study patients could be excluded within the first 24 hours after randomisation according to two criteria (weaning of mechanical ventilation or sepsis/pneumonia). As a result, 20% of the study patients (28 out of the 139 randomised infants) were excluded. Since no information is available on the outcome of those infants, analysis based on an intent-to-treat principle is not possible. As a result, there is a substantially higher risk for bias in the results of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>.</P>

</P>
<P>
<B>MORTALITY (Outcomes 1.1 and 1.2):</B>
<BR/>Five studies reported on mortality before discharge. None of the studies found a significant difference. Meta-analysis of these five trials (264 infants) showed no significant effect of paralysis on mortality before discharge (typical relative risk (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.88, 1.74; typical risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% CI -0.04, 0.17).<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>) reported on mortality before 28 days of life. No significant difference was found (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.45, 1.57; RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.14, 0.08).</P>
<P>
<B>PNEUMOTHORAX and AIR LEAK (Outcomes 1.3 and 1.4):</B>
<BR/>All the studies reported on the incidence of pneumothorax with or without pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>) found a significant decrease in risk of pneumothorax (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03, 0.59; RD -0.91, 95% CI -1.13, -0.69). In the other studies, the incidence of pneumothorax was similar in both groups. Meta-analysis of five trials (400 infants) showed no significant difference in risk for pneumothorax (with or without PIE) (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58, 1.21; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.11, 0.04) (Outcome 1.3). When the infant that was excluded from the analysis in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK> was included in the meta-analysis for this outcome, the result did not change significantly (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59, 1.22). In the meta-analysis of all trials, there is substantial heterogeneity for pneumothorax (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 94%, p &lt; 0.00001 for RD), that appears to be attributable to the study by <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>. In the subgroup analysis of trials not selecting for asynchrony at study entry where the Greenough study is not included, no heterogeneity is noted.</P>
<P>Only one study reported on the combined "any air leak", defined as pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Quinn noted no difference in the risk of any air leak (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.71, 4.88; RD 0.15, 95% CI -0.07, 0.37) (Outcome 1.4)(<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>).</P>

<B>INTRAVENTRICULAR </B>haemorrhage<B> (IVH) (Outcomes 1.5 and 1.6):</B>
<BR/>Three studies reported on the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage, and one additional study reported only on severe IVH. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>) found a significant decrease in risk for IVH (any grade) (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20, 0.76; RD -0.64, 95% CI -0.92, -0.37). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>) found a trend towards less IVH (any grade) in paralysed infants, but it was not statistically significant. In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>) no difference was noted. Meta-analysis of these three trials shows a significant decrease in risk of any grade IVH in paralysed infants, with a relative risk reduction of 46% (typical RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34, 0.89), and an absolute risk reduction of 24% (typical RD -0.24, 95% CI -0.41, -0.07).</P>
<P>Two studies reported on the risk for severe IVH. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>) a marked decrease was found (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00, 0.77; RD -0.70, 95% CI -0.99, -0.41). In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>) no difference was noted. Meta-analysis of these two trials showed a reduction of severe IVH in paralysed infants, of borderline statistical significance: typical RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25, 1.06; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.17, -0.00. Statistical heterogeneity is noted for the effect of paralysis on severe IVH (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 95% for RD).</P>

<B>CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE (CLD) IN SURVIVORS (Outcome 1.7 and 1.8):</B>
<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>) reported on chronic lung disease. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK> a trend towards less chronic lung disease at 28 days postnatal age, defined as the need for supplemental oxygen with the presence of opacifications on chest radiograph, was found in the group of paralysed infants (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19, 1.09; RD -0.24, 95% CI -0.46, -0.01). However, in the meta-analysis of both trials (224 infants) no significant difference was found for this outcome (typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61, 1.12; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.21, 0.04).</P>
<P>Only Shaw reported on the risk for chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. No significant difference was found (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.80, 1.88; RD 0.07, 95% CI -0.08, 0.22).</P>

<B>CYSTIC PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA (PVL) (Outcome 1.9):</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK> reported on the incidence of PVL. No difference was noted (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.35, 4.56; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05, 0.07).</P>
<P>
<B>DURATION OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION</B>
<BR/>This outcome measure was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>). In the study by Bancalari the duration of ventilation is reported for the 64 infants who survived after 28 days. No significant difference was found between the paralysed and non-paralysed infants: median 3.2 days (range 1.0 - 111.2) versus 5.1 days (range 1.0 - 82.3). In the studies by Pollitzer and Quinn it was unclear whether the outcome was reported for all randomised infants or just for the surviving infants. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK> infants in the paralysis group were ventilated for a mean duration of 114 hours (range 32 - 264) compared to 105 hours (range 36 - 240) for the infants in the control group, which was not significantly different. Also, no difference was found in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK> in the median number of days of mechanical ventilation: 5.0 days (range 1 - 63) for the paralysed infants (group P) versus 5.0 days (range 1 - 32) for the selectively paralysed infants (group M). Because the outcome was expressed differently in the two studies (mean versus median) and the standard deviations were not available, we did not pool the results for meta-analysis. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK> a retrospective comparison was made for this outcome. Paralysed infants from the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>), who had little or no pneumothorax, were compared with a historical group of matched ventilated infants, from the six months preceding the randomised study, who had pneumothorax but who had not been paralysed after the pneumothorax developed. The paralysed infants did require more prolonged mechanical ventilation [median 129 hours (range 55 - 2302) versus 55 hours (range 13 - 181), p &lt; 0.01].</P>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK> reported on the duration of oxygen dependency. In both studies no statistically significant difference was found. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK> (data reported for the 64 infants surviving after 28 days) the paralysed infants were weaned from the oxygen more quickly, but there was a wide individual variation in oxygen requirement: median of 9.4 days (range 3.8 - 162.7) for the paralysed infants versus a median of 17.2 days (range 2.1 - 154.5) for the non-paralysed infants. <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK> retrospectively compared the paralysed infants with the matched control infants. No significant difference was found in the median hours of oxygen use: 196 hours (range 88 - 4300) for the paralysed versus 221 hours (range 84 - 2208) for the nonparalysed infants.</P>

<B>CARDIOCIRCULATORY INSTABILITY</B>
<BR/>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK> blood pressure, which was not further defined, increased by a median of 2 mm Hg (range -12 to +17) in the paralysed infants, compared with a median increase of 3 mm Hg (range -7 to +18) in the control infants, which was not significantly different. <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK> reported three out of 22 study infants having hypotension, defined as a diastolic blood pressure of less than 20 mm Hg, of which two were from the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Pollitzer-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pollitzer 1981</LINK> just stated that no differences were found in blood pressure between paralysed and nonparalysed infants, if data were pooled.

<B>SENSITIVITY ANALYSES</B>
<BR/>Because of the higher risk for bias in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK> sensitivity analyses were performed in order to evaluate the importance of the results of the trial in the calculation of the pooled estimates of effect on mortality, pneumothorax and CLD.

<B>ROUTINE PARALYSIS VERSUS NO OR SELECTIVE PARALYSIS (TRIALS SELECTING FOR ASYNCHRONY AT ENTRY) (COMPARISON 2)</B>
</P>
<P>In three trials, ventilated infants were selected before entering the trial on some evidence of asynchrony with the ventilator indicating a higher risk of complications. Two trials based their selection on the respiratory pattern of the infant (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>). In a third study, selection was based on cerebral blood flow velocity pattern (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>). Meta-analysis of these three trials showed no significant difference in mortality before discharge (typical RR 0.95 95% CI 0.49, 1.84; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.18, 0.15) (Outcome 2.1). There was a significant decrease in risk of pneumothorax (typical RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11, 0.77; typical RD -0.43, 95% CI -0.64, -0.23) (Outcome 2.2) and a significant reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage (typical RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34, 0.89; typical RD -0.24, 95% CI -0.41, -0.07) (Outcome 2.4). Severe IVH was reported in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>), showing a reduction (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00, 0.77; RD -0.70, 95% CI -0.99, -0.41) (Outcome 2.5). If the excluded infant from the study by <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK> was included in the meta-analysis for the outcome of pneumothorax, no significant change for this outcome was seen.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:32:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodologic quality of the included trials was generally good as regards control of selection bias and attrition bias. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>), however, a substantial proportion of randomised infants were excluded during the first 24 hours of the trial and lost for further analyses. Sensitivity analysis, however, showed that the pooled estimates of effect did not change substantially by adding or subtracting the Bancalari trial in the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, results of meta-analysis for the outcomes where the Bancalari trial adds data should be interpreted with more caution. Because of the nature of the intervention, blinding of care givers was not possible. Knowledge of the intervention (paralysis or no paralysis) could have led to biased use of co-interventions (additional therapeutic, diagnostic or screening interventions), although we have no direct evidence that this was the case. In all but one trial, it was unclear if outcome assessment was blinded, and thus it is unclear whether there was biased ascertainment of outcomes including grade of IVH.</P>
<P>The relatively small sample size of most of the eligible trials for this review, leaving 224 infants in the treatment arm and 234 infants in the control arm for the meta-analyses, results in imprecision in estimating the effect sizes. This is evident from the wide confidence intervals around the point estimate for some of the outcomes. Thus, the power of the meta-analyses may be insufficient to detect an existing effect from neuromuscular paralysis for some of the outcomes.</P>
<P>All the included trials studied preterm infants ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome; thus, the conclusions are only applicable to this specific population of newborn infants. Since no randomised trial of neuromuscular paralysis of term ventilated infants was found, no conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of neuromuscular paralysis in term newborn infants.</P>
<P>All trials used pancuronium as the neuromuscular blocking agent, with a dosage varying between 0.03 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg per dose. Pancuronium was the first steroidal nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. It has vagolytic effects, is long acting and is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1998</LINK>). Other and newer nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, such as cis-atracurium, could have advantages over pancuronium because of their shorter elimination half-life and a non-enzymatic degradation pathway, making them independent of either hepatic or renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Atherton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atherton 1999</LINK>). There is no evidence on the benefits and adverse effects of these newer neuromuscular blocking agents in newborn infants.</P>
<P>From the results of the individual trials and the meta-analysis, there seems to be some benefit of routine neuromuscular paralysis with pancuronium on acute pulmonary and neurologic complications, if restricted to ventilated infants showing evidence of asynchrony with the ventilator, but not if routinely administered to all ventilated infants. In the subgroup analysis of trials selecting the ventilated infants before they enter the study on the basis of a higher risk of pneumothorax or intraventricular haemorrhage, neuromuscular paralysis reduces the incidence of IVH and possibly air leak syndrome. In the subgroup of trials where no selection of the ventilated infants was done, no benefit is seen for any of the outcomes. Whether muscle relaxation also improves long term pulmonary and neurologic outcome is not clear from this review. The two trials reporting on chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>), in which ventilated infants were not selected on the basis of asynchrony with the ventilator, found no benefit of neuromuscular paralysis. For the effect of paralysis on the duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen dependency, no conclusions can be drawn from the analyses of the included randomised trials because of lack of suitable data. None of the studies measured neurologic development as an outcome measure. Thus, although there seems to be some benefit of neuromuscular paralysis with pancuronium on the risk of air leak and intraventricular haemorrhage in ventilated infants "fighting" the ventilator, uncertainty remains regarding the long term pulmonary and neurologic effects.</P>
<P>Adverse effects from neuromuscular paralysis are mainly reported in case reports, case control studies and other observational studies. In 1979 Philips already warned about hypoxaemia after pancuronium paralysis (<LINK REF="REF-Philips-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philips 1979</LINK>). In a prospective study of 49 infants Runkle observed a decrease of PaO2 in infants with hyaline membrane disease following muscle relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Runkle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runkle 1984</LINK>). Miller demonstrated that functional residual capacity of the lungs and oxygenation decreased after muscle relaxation in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1994</LINK>). Other adverse effects reported are tachycardia and increased blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Cabal-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabal 1985</LINK>), and an increased risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Bancalari-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bancalari 1980</LINK>). Following prolonged paralysis, muscle weakness and atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Torres-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torres 1985</LINK>) and joint contractures (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanconi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanconi 1995</LINK>) have been described. Recently, sensorineural hearing loss has been mentioned to be associated with prolonged use of neuromuscular blocking agents (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1999</LINK>). Data concerning those adverse events from the randomised trials included in this review are insufficient to allow for a conclusion about the safety of neuromuscular paralysis. Thus, uncertainty remains regarding the short term and longer term risks of the routine use of muscle relaxation in ventilated newborn infants.</P>
<P>The question remains how to select in daily practice those infants who are in asynchrony with the ventilator and, thus, are at risk for pulmonary or neurologic complications during or following mechanical ventilation. The methods used by <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Perlman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Perlman 1985</LINK>, as previously described, are very detailed and reproducible, but not practical in a busy neonatal unit. A selection based on a clinical impression of the infant "fighting" the ventilator, as is used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK>, is easy to apply, but may be more subjective and, thus, less reproducible. Levene and Quinn (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1992</LINK>) suggest combining clinical assessment of asynchrony with the ventilator with variability of the arterial blood pressure trace, which should be less than 10%. According to Alexander and Todres (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1998</LINK>) assessment of ventilator wave form could help determine whether an infant is breathing in synchrony or not. Finally, they suggest that a short therapeutic trial is an easy way to determine whether an infant would benefit from neuromuscular paralysis. At present, it is unknown which is the best method. In daily practice neonatologists most often rely on their clinical impression of the infant "fighting" the ventilator.</P>
<P>An important issue in the discussion of neuromuscular paralysis is the question whether paralysis is the best and safest strategy to obtain a more efficient mechanical ventilation in the newborn infant who is "fighting" the ventilator. The clinician should be aware that this phenomenon could be a sign of pain or stress caused by mechanical ventilation and, thus, should provide for adequate analgesia and sedation, given an adequate ventilation with normoxia and normocapnia and an adequate circulation. Another approach to synchronize the infant with the ventilator and improve mechanical ventilation could be to tune the mechanical ventilation in to the infant's own respiratory pattern. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1998</LINK> showed that high frequency positive pressure ventilation, mimicking the preterm infant's respiratory rate, reduces the risk for air leak compared with conventional ventilation. Furthermore, patient triggered ventilation or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation were associated with a shorter duration of ventilation compared with conventional ventilation. Thus, it is reasonable to consider neuromuscular paralysis as a treatment only if the infant is still "fighting" the ventilator, despite adequate analgesia and/or sedation and optimised synchronized mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>A limitation of this review concerns the external validity of the included trials. In only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1993</LINK>) was exogenous surfactant used for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. It is known that the use of surfactant changed neonatal outcome dramatically, including a significant reduction in the incidence of pneumothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1998</LINK>). Moreover, in current practice preterm infants often exhibit less severe respiratory distress syndrome because of antenatal lung maturation, and they are treated with new ventilation techniques such as high-frequency ventilation, which may cause less lung injury. Moreover, the increasing use of analgesics and sedatives certainly has had an effect on the behaviour of the newborn infant during mechanical ventilation. Only in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1992</LINK> were control infants systematically treated with morphine. Thus, it is uncertain whether the conclusions of this review are applicable to the present population of preterm infants.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:32:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The routine use neuromuscular blockade with pancuronium in a selected population of ventilated preterm infants breathing in asynchrony with the ventilator results in a reduction of intraventricular haemorrhage and possibly of pneumothorax. No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect on long term pulmonary and neurologic outcome or regarding the safety of prolonged use of pancuronium in ventilated preterm infants. Because of the lack of data from randomised trials and because of limited external validity of the trials, the routine use of pancuronium in ventilated preterm infants cannot be recommended based on current evidence. No data are available from randomised controlled trials about the efficacy or adverse effects of neuromuscular paralysis in term ventilated newborn infants, or about the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents other than pancuronium.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:32:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since there is no evidence of effect regarding some major outcome measures and because of the limited external validity of the existing trials, new trials are needed. Future research should address the effects of routine neuromuscular paralysis on long term pulmonary and neurologic outcome, and on long term adverse effects, such as joint contractures and hearing loss. This could initially be achieved by assessing the infants from the cohorts of the included randomised trials. New studies are needed to identify which ventilated newborn infants might possibly benefit from neuromuscular paralysis. Therefore, methods should be developed and tested to identify in an easy and practical way the ventilated infants who are still asynchronous with the ventilator, after optimisation of ventilation technique and adequate analgesia and sedation. Also, trials are needed to study the short and long term effects of newer neuromuscular blocking agents in ventilated newborn infants.</P>

<P>28 of the 139 randomised infants (17 in the control group and 11 in treatment group) were excluded after randomisation: 18 because of weaning from the ventilator or weaning of inspired fraction of oxygen below 40% in the first 24 hours of the study, and another 10 because of sepsis or pneumonia. No information is available on the outcome of those infants.<BR/>Chronic lung disease was defined as the need for supplemental oxygen for more than 28 days with the presence of persistent diffuse opacities on chest radiograph.<BR/>Intracranial haemorrhage was diagnosed in 52 out of 111 infants. In 33 infants it was confirmed with CT-scan or postmortem examination. In the remaining 19 infants the diagnosis was made clinically (sudden deterioration, tense fontanel, seizures, blood in CSF). No ultrasound was used to diagnose intracranial haemorrhage. Therefore this outcome could not be used for the meta-analysis.</P>
