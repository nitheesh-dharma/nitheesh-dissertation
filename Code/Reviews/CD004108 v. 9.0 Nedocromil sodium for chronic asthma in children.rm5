Thanks for dealing with all the issued raised by the two peer reviewers.&lt;br&gt;I have made some (final?) adjustments in red. I think this is now a balanced report of the variation in results between the different study types, and does not presume to know why this discrepancy has arisen. I have removed the global statement in the abstract results as it is not fair to imply that Szefler is negative on all counts.&lt;br&gt;If all the authors are happy with this it can go for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;March 9 2006&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 6 Jan 06 ** PLease make sure you use this version of the review**&lt;br&gt;1.*** Please add date of last search in Abstract and search sections.****&lt;br&gt;TJL: Done &lt;br&gt;2. Synopsis modified&lt;br&gt;TJL: Agreed&lt;br&gt;3. RevMan 4.2 is the correct description of the software according to the style guide&lt;br&gt;TJL: Agreed&lt;br&gt;4. Sentence order in conclusion changed a bit&lt;br&gt;TJL: OK&lt;br&gt;5. Changes in the main text left in red. I have run spell check again as the previous corrections that I made have been lost.&lt;br&gt;6. **Please add mean and CI of symptom free days from the long term study****&lt;br&gt;TJL: Done&lt;br&gt;7. I have amended the reporting in subgroups in the results section (especially lung function). The key issue is not whether an individual subgroup achieves significance but whether there is a between subgroup difference. This is hard to unpick with so many subgroups there is a differene in the resuits from Szefler as stated. By subtracting the individual Chi-square subgroup totals from the overall Chi total the p value for between group differences can be calculated. I have done this and amended the results which erroneously reported no difference between subgroups in various places.&lt;br&gt;TJL: Agreed&lt;br&gt;8. ***Reddel 1999 in the discussion and CONSORT 2001 have no reference to link to.*** Please add.&lt;br&gt;TJL: Done&lt;br&gt;9.&amp;quot;But this problem could be overcome by changing the flavour of nedocromil aerosol.&amp;quot; If this were possible the manufacturers would have done it I think? I have removed the comment. Also minor changes in red. Otherwise the discussion reads much better now.&lt;br&gt;TJL: Agreed. &lt;br&gt;10. Thanks for all the hard work on this review. Could the asterisked items above be attended to and then this is ready for peer review. Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=================================&lt;br&gt;Response from Sridhar (03/01/2005): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please find the attached nedocromil review. I agree with all the changes you have suggested. Definitely it looks in a better shape. I have converted the changes in red to black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks once again for all your help &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wishing you both A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sridhar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Response from Mike McKean (14/12/2005): &lt;br&gt;Dear Toby, &lt;br&gt;Thanks for this &amp;#8211; I agree that this review is now in much better shape with a more exacting analysis of the effects of publication bias.&lt;br&gt;Specifically:&lt;br&gt; 1. synopsis &amp;#8211; great&lt;br&gt; 2. refs &amp;#8211; thanks&lt;br&gt; 3. abstract results- agreed&lt;br&gt; 4. I like the paragraph in the discussion &amp;#8211; it nicely points out the weakness of the analyses of the small studies.&lt;br&gt; 5. thanks&lt;br&gt; 6. thanks&lt;br&gt; 7. thanks&lt;br&gt; 8. must learn how to do this one day!&lt;br&gt; 9. agreed&lt;br&gt;So &amp;#8211; if Sridhar is happy with these changes I suggest he changes red to black and he submits it again! Let me know what you think Sridhar.&lt;br&gt;Mike&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Changes made by TJL (061205)&lt;br&gt;i) Added synopsis (please do not delete - we cannot publish the review without one)&lt;br&gt;ii) Checked references and linked these to IDs&lt;br&gt;iii) Re-written abstract (Results)&lt;br&gt;iii) Visual inspection of change in FEV1, FVC, am PEF, beta-agonist usage by funnel plot. This suggests publication bias. Added figures 01, 02, 03 &amp;amp; 04 to demonstrate this (see discussion). &lt;br&gt;iv) Entered data from Sekerel study (see excel attachment) and re-written results in red.&lt;br&gt;v) Beta-agonist usage data for Szefler 2000 are not correct - outcome in RevMan is doses per day, but the data for medication usage entered as doses per week (as reported in the study). I have converted this to per by dividing mean and SD by 7. &lt;br&gt;vi) Incomplete subgroup analyses - I have moved data down to fill gaps.&lt;br&gt;vii) Re-entered crossover data as GIV rather than WMD. &lt;br&gt;viii) van Bever should be considered included - it does meet the entry criteria of the review based upon the abstract, but it will not contribute any data. Given the justified concerns regarding publication bias it should not be forgotten about. Methodlogical limitations enhanced on the basis of the concerns described (See red). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:05:47 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="INCS-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.22" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Nedocromil (or Tilade) is a 'preventer' therapy used to treat chronic asthma in children. It is thought to be safer than inhaled steroids and can be used for the management of mild to moderate asthma. The review of studies including 15 trials and 1422 children found that there were some encouraging results in short term studies when nedocromil was compared on its own with placebo, particularly with regard to lung function tests. However, these results were not confirmed in one large, longer term study of four to six years duration, which did not show significant difference in the primary outcome of symptom free days. This study was conducted in children who had mild asthma. There may be a role for nedocromil in the management of moderate asthma, but it should be assessed in relation to inhaled steroids, whose efficacy is well-established. This particularly important in symptomatic asthma. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 10:07:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airway Group trials register, review articles, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the drug manufacturer and primary authors for additional citations. We also searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings. The last search was carried out in November 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised placebo controlled trials comparing nedocromil sodium to placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma in children (0 to 18 years). </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifteen trials (twelve parallel group studies; three crossover trials recruiting 1422 children (837 males and 585 females)) were included. The studies were generally of good methodological quality. Two large long term studies used nedocromil for six months and four to six years and showed conflicting results in symptom free days. Short term studies (duration between 4 weeks to 12 weeks) showed that nedocromil sodium produced some improvement in a number of efficacy measures compared to placebo including FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> % predicted, PC20 FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, evening PEF and symptom scores. The parent's assessment of efficacy was in favour of nedocromil (odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). Nedocromil sodium has a good safety profile. The only significant side effect observed was unpleasant taste. There was little evidence for a clinically dose response effect and only a few studies recruited participants with severe asthma.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A limited number of small studies have shown that nedocromil is of benefit in improving lung function and some measures of symptoms, but the evidence with regard to the primary outcome of the review was conflicting. Two long-term trials did not show consistent effects on lung function outcomes, whereas several small short-term trials have shown benefit in these outcomes. Differing severities at baseline may explain this difference with milder participants experiencing less benefit, although the discrepancy between study findings may also reflect publication bias. Nedocromil sodium is associated with a very good safety profile with no significant short term or long- term adverse side effects. Although nedocromil may have advantages over inhaled corticosteroids in terms of side effects, there is a need for head to head trials of nedocromil and inhaled corticosteroids to establish whether asthma control is similar, especially in mild asthma. It is not yet clear where nedocromil should sit in relation to other therapies in the treatment of asthma in children. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 10:07:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is a disease of chronic airway inflammation characterised by reversible airway obstruction and increased airway responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1998</LINK>). It is also defined as "reversible airways obstruction associated with bronchial hyperreactivity, allergic inflammation of the airways and a response to treatment with bronchodilators with regular prophylactic inhaled anti-inflammatory agents" (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Nedocromil sodium is a chromone. It is the disodium salt of a pyranoquinoline dicarboxylic acid developed as an anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Rainey--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rainey 1992</LINK>). A number of clinical trials in adults have shown the efficacy of nedocromil sodium in the management of chronic asthma in adults and a meta-analysis of all the placebo controlled trials has shown that the drug is an effective treatment for adult asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1993</LINK>). However there have been only a few trials looking at the safety and efficacy of this drug in children with asthma.</P>
<P>At present, inhaled nedocromil sodium is one of the controller medications recommended for the treatment of mild persistent asthma along with sodium cromoglycate and inhaled corticosteroids. These recommendations are based on the international guidelines on asthma management, the Global Initiative for Asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>) and also the international guidelines on diagnosis and management of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1997</LINK>). The British asthma guidelines coordinating committee (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>) recommends nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate as alternatives to corticosteroids at step 2 of the management of chronic asthma in children. A recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that nedocromil sodium used before exercise reduces the severity and duration of exercise induced bronchoconstriction in both children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Spooner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spooner 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although inhaled corticosteroids play a crucial role in the management of childhood asthma, the long- term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids used in the management of chronic asthma in children are not clearly known. Pooled effect estimates of fluticasone in children indicate an improvement in Fixed expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) and am Peak expiratory flow (PEF) of around 110 ml and 25.7 L/min respectively when given at a dose 100 mcg/d (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). However, there is concern that the adverse effects of long- term inhaled corticosteroids in treating children with mild asthma may outweigh the beneficial effects. A recent Cochrane review has shown an effect of inhaled beclomethasone on linear growth in children (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 1999</LINK>). Nedocromil sodium is associated with very good safety profile with no significant adverse side effects. The common side effect reported with the use of nedocromil is unpleasant taste sensation, which might pose problems with compliance in children (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently inhaled corticosteroids are the main stay in the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children. Perhaps the more important question to answer is whether nedocromil sodium can be regarded as an alternative first line anti-inflammatory treatment to sodium cromoglycate or inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children. With this in mind we set out to review the safety and efficacy of nedocromil sodium in the treatment of chronic asthma in children.</P>

<P>Both authors independently extracted data using specially designed data extraction forms. The characteristics of the trial participants, interventions and outcomes for the included trials is presented in study tables. We contacted authors or clarification or further information.</P>
<P>One author (AVS) extracted data for each outcome from the published results of included trials. In the case of continuous outcomes such as spirometry:</P>
<P>1. Where outcomes were evaluated at a number of time points, only data from the last time point that could be evaluated was used.<BR/>2.

If an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) was not used by the investigators, and it was not explicit in the presentation of results how many participants (N) were in each group at the time of last evaluation of that outcome, the appropriate N value for each intervention group was calculated by subtracting the number of participants who withdrew in each intervention group from those randomised to each intervention group.</P>
<P>Authors were written to (by mail, fax and/or electronic mail) on at least two occasions to clarify details of request missing outcome data. An attempt was made to send requests to correct current addresses by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE and hospital World Wide Web (WWW) sites for up-to-date contact details.

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-11 17:54:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Visual inspection of funnel plots was undertaken in order to assess whether the pooled effect estimates potentially overestimate the effect of nedocromil. In order to reduce possible publication bias, we have attempted to include results from trials where only a limited number of estimates are available. If the lack of SDs limited the availability of effect estimates which could contribute to a meta-analysis, we have imputed SDs as an average of those available. This has only been undertaken if there were three or more studies which contributed data.</P>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1993</LINK>) did not report of clinical symptom scores as outcome measures. One study reported in abstract form did not contribute data to any outcomes analysed as these were not made available for our review (<LINK REF="STD-van-Bever-1996" TYPE="STUDY">van Bever 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not consider the following outcome measures:<BR/>1. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002b</LINK>) included outcomes related directly to the biological basis of inflammation in asthma. These included eosinophilic blood count, serum eosinophilic cationic protein (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002a</LINK>), sIL-2R, IL-4, sICAM and IgE (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002a</LINK>) and serum IgE and IL-4 levels (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002b</LINK>). These outcomes involve invasive blood sampling and are not generally regarded as outcome measures to assess the clinical efficacy of nedocromil sodium in children. These outcome measures could not be merged because they were different inflammatory markers with often different units. They are potentially interesting data and are discussed in the results.<BR/>2. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Murray-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1993</LINK>), nebulised nedocromil sodium was used on two occasions to assess the FEV<SUB>1</SUB> response to fog challenge.<BR/>3.

<P>A structured approach was used in reporting the result (Study design: parallel group or crossover studies; Sub-groups: all doses, all devices, all durations and all severities; Outcome measurement: FEV1, FVC, PEF etc; Unit of measurement: i.e. absolute, % predicted or change compared to baseline). Within each component sub-group analysis by dose, length of intervention, device and severity are reported, where the data permit. This was structured in the following way.</P>
<P>A) Comparison 01 considers each outcome according to daily dose of nedocromil used (8 mg/day, 12 mg/day or 16 mg/day or more).<BR/>B) Comparisons 02 considers each outcome according to the severity of asthma (mild, moderate, severe asthma).<BR/>C) Comparison 03 considers each outcome according to the type of device used to deliver nedocromil sodium (MDI, MDI plus spacer, nebuliser).<BR/>D) Comparison 04 considers search outcome according to the duration of intervention (less than one month, one to six months, more than six months).<BR/>E) Comparison 05 considers long term studies( six months or longer ) versus short term (less than six months) studies.<BR/>F) In cross over studies (06, 07), the comparison considers each outcome according to the dose of nedocromil used and the delivery device.</P>

Three studies with 852 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Businco-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Businco 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_nig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">König 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>) assessed nedocromil 16 mg/day versus placebo over a period of four weeks, 24 weeks and 4.3 years respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (Chi-squared 6.07, df 1, P = 0.01). When all the studies were pooled, there was no significant difference between nedocromil and placebo with fixed-effect (WMD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.1) and random-effects modelling (WMD 0.1 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.2). Further sub-group analyses based on delivery device and severities showed no significant difference between subgroups. Subgroup analysis based on the duration of treatment did show a significant difference between trials of different durations, (Chi-squared 10.99, df 2, P = 0.004).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 09:52:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review has assessed the efficacy and side-effect profile of inhaled nedocromil sodium in the treatment of chronic childhood asthma. Only randomised, placebo controlled trials were included and the overall methodological quality of the studies was good. This review includes fifteen studies of 1422 children (837 males and 585 females). The studies were conducted across eight countries over a 12 year period (1990 to 2002). Three of the studies were multi-centre trials. Most of the studies were conducted in the secondary care (recruiting participants from outpatient clinics). Only one study was conducted in the primary care setting.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure of this review was asthma symptom free days. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>) reported symptom free days as change from baseline in episode free days per month. There was no significant difference demonstrated between nedocromil and the placebo in that study. <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_nig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">König 1995</LINK> reported a significant effect in the proportion of symptom free days, although it reported no effect on daily asthma symptom score. Similarly studies assessing the change from baseline in daytime asthma, night-time asthma and episode free days showed no effect in favour of nedocromil (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>). However three small short term studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002b</LINK>) using 16 mg/day of nedocromil sodium, reported an improvement in daily asthma symptom score in favour of nedocromil.</P>
<P>Change in FEV1, change in FVC and change in am PEF outcomes are dominated by the effect estimate derived from the large long term study (<LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>). This study reported consistently non-significant effects in a sample of children mild to moderate asthma. It is of note that the children recruited to the inhaled steroid arm did not appear to derive the same sort of benefit from budesonide as that observed in other studies of children with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2003</LINK>). The disposition of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK> may explain the lack of a response to treatment in terms of lung function outcomes, particularly when the positive response to nedocromil as absolute FEV1% predicted is considered. The asymmetrical funnel plots for these outcomes may well be a function of clinical heterogeneity and the statistical power of <LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>, rather than publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR), to various pharmacological stimuli was assessed in a few studies. In the large long term study (<LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>), there was no difference between the groups in the methacholine PC20 FEV1. However pooling the three short term studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002b</LINK>) showed an improvement of 0.44 mg/ml (95% CI 0.14 to 0.73) in histamine PC20 FEV1 in favour of nedocromil sodium.</P>
<P>Overall there were conflicting findings in terms of episode free days, rescue beta-2 agonist use, in terms of hospitalisations, emergency department attendances and prednisolone courses. It is possible that nedocromil tends to improve day to day persistent asthma symptoms, but is not efficacious enough to prevent an acute attack. There may be underlying reasons for this. It has been shown that peak expiratory flow (PEF) variation is strikingly different during exacerbations compared with day to day poor asthma control (<LINK REF="REF-Reddel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddel 1999</LINK>). This could suggest that a large stimulus to the airways producing a profound drop in PEF is not blocked by a mast-cell stabilising drug perhaps because other mechanisms are activated.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the withdrawal rate due to asthma exacerbations between the two groups. Important outcome measures such as days missed from school due to asthma exacerbations and GP attendance rates were not reported. Withdrawal rates in the context of a clinical trial cannot be considered equivalent to hospital admission rates or GP attendance rates due to exacerbation of asthma, but may be a surrogate marker for these.</P>
<P>Clinician assessment of efficacy and non-efficacy was not significant, although it was not reported whether the clinician's assessment of efficacy and non-efficacy was subjective or based on objective criteria. However, nedocromil was significantly more likely to be perceived as effective by parents than placebo. Parental assessment of efficacy and non-efficacy of treatment although subjective, has major implications for adherence with preventative therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nedocromil sodium has a good safety profile. No other appreciable short term and long-term side effects were demonstrated. The common side effects reported with the use of nedocromil include sore throat, unpleasant taste, headache and other systemic side effects like angio-neurotic oedema, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough on aerosol inhalation. The only significant side effect observed due to nedocromil was unpleasant taste. There was no difference between the nedocromil and the placebo groups in the incidence of other side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Businco-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Businco 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_nig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">König 1995</LINK>). The increased incidence of unpleasant taste could pose a major problem with compliance of nedocromil therapy in children, which is very crucial in effective asthma control.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>) reported long term health outcomes in children following nedocromil therapy. Changes in height (cm), changes in bone density (g/cm2) and change in total score on child depression inventory were assessed as long- term outcome measures. There was no difference between the nedocromil and the placebo groups. A recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 1999</LINK>) has shown a detrimental effect of inhaled beclomethasone on short term linear growth in children. However in the large long term study (<LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>), although there was a initial reduction in growth velocity with inhaled budesonide group compared to the placebo, there was no change in final stature between the two groups.</P>
<P>Health related quality of life (HRQOL), which was one of the secondary outcome measure was not reported in any of the trials.</P>
<P>There are limited data on the effect of nedocromil sodium on various inflammatory markers in the serum of asthmatic children. Serum eosinophilic blood counts, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), sIL -2R, IL-4, sICAM and total IgE are used as serum markers of airway inflammation in asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2001</LINK>). The three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2002b</LINK>) which, reported inflammatory mediators of asthma showed a significant decrease in the percentage of blood eosinophil count, serum s IL-2R and serum IL-4 levels in favour of nedocromil. There was no difference in the serum eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), serum IgE and serum sICAM levels between the two groups. These inflammatory markers could not be meta-analysed because of different inflammatory markers and different units in which they are reported. These outcomes involve invasive blood sampling and are not generally regarded as outcome measures to assess the clinical efficacy of nedocromil sodium in children. The anti-inflammatory properties of nedocromil, opens the possibility of it having a disease modifying effect in the long term, although the results are clearly not consistent between the studies.</P>
<P>In conclusion, this review has shown the large long term studies (<LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_nig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">König 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>) using nedocromil for six months and 4.3 years respectively showed no benefit in favour of nedocromil in asthma symptom free days, lung function tests, BHR to methacholine, broncho-dilator use, hospitalisations, emergency department attendances, and prednisolone courses. However a number of small short term studies(using nedocromil for four weeks to 12 week period) have shown some improvement in daily asthma symptom scores, lung function tests and BHR to histamine in favour of nedocromil. The reasons for the apparent discrepancy in findings between small short-term studies and the large long-term study may be accounted for by severity. This review also has shown that nedocromil sodium is associated with very good safety profile with no significant short term or long- term adverse side effects. The only significant side effect observed due to nedocromil was unpleasant taste.</P>
<P>Although nedocromil clearly has advantages over inhaled corticosteroids in regards to side effects, there is a lack of head to head trials of nedocromil versus inhaled corticosteroids to establish if nedocromil has advantages in symptoms, lung function and other outcomes over inhaled steroids especially in mild asthma. It is not yet clear where nedocromil should sit in relation to other therapies in the treatment of asthma in children. Whilst the studies conducted in children with mild asthma do not provide consistent evidence that nedocromil improves symptoms and lung function, the short term studies in more severe participants suggest improvement in these variables. Additional confirmatory studies in more moderately severe children (FEV1 or peak flow % predicted lower than 80% (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>)) are required. Assessment of any potential clinically relevant effect of nedocromil sodium in the treatment of asthma will be best achieved by a further systematic review assessing trials in which participants have been randomised to nedocromil and inhaled corticosteroids within the same trial such as <LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>. This study showed that continuous daily treatment with inhaled budesonide 400 micrograms/day leads to better control of asthma than nedocromil sodium, and its side effects are limited to a small, transient reduction in growth velocity with no change in final stature between the two groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Methodological limitations</HEADING>
<P>1) The possibility of publication bias related to missed published trials occurs in all systematic reviews. A number of strategies have been undertaken in order to minimise the impact of 'missed' negative data sets such as a comprehensive electronic search, imputation, and the inclusion wherever possible of studies not indexed on medical literature databases (<LINK REF="STD-van-Bever-1996" TYPE="STUDY">van Bever 1996</LINK>). It is impossible to estimate the impact of missed studies on our findings, but should data become available in the future, substantive amendment will allow us to assess the extent to which additional data affect our findings.</P>
<P>2) A large number of efficacy outcomes were reported, using a range of different scales. This factor, combined with a significant proportion of studies in which numerical data were either not presented with standard deviations around mean scores or in which authors were unable or unwilling to provide such data, reduced the power of the analysis. A wide variety of scales were used to assess the symptoms, and the quality of reporting was poor with several trials failing to provide standard deviation values for mean treatment effects.</P>
<P>3) The majority of studies were conducted in a secondary care setting, with patients attending hospital outpatient clinics for review. In most instances it was not clear how patients were identified as potential recruits (e.g. patients already attending hospital asthma clinics, primary care referrals, advertisement etc. Only one study was carried out in a primary care. Study setting may therefore have biased recruitment towards patients with more symptoms, since they have been largely conducted in secondary care.</P>
<P>4) In some studies data were not given in the form suitable for meta-analysis. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1993</LINK>), several of the outcomes were estimated based on the mean difference reported and the P values. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Businco-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Businco 1990</LINK>), the data has been estimated from the graphs and the P values. Imputing missing standard deviations is a compromise for missing data.</P>
<P>5) A significant proportion of outcome data from individual trials could not be included in the meta-analysis because either standard deviation values for mean effect sizes were not presented in the original citation or no numerical data were presented at all. These missing data will diminish the power of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>6) The studies included in this review included children with a spectrum of asthma severity being treated with a range of drug doses delivered by various means (nebuliser, MDI, MDI plus spacer) over a range of treatment periods. These factors should be taken into account when considering the findings of this review.</P>
<P>7) The identification of three ranges for daily nedocromil sodium dose is arbitrary. However the range boundaries were felt to generally reflect dose distinctions made in clinical practice.</P>
<P>8) In three crossover studies the effect of a single dose of nedocromil sodium on bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) to various respiratory stimuli has been assessed. The treatment difference between nedocromil and placebo may be of clinical significance, although the level of significant change is difficult to translate into a clinically meaningful measure.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 09:52:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>A number of small studies have shown that nedocromil sodium improves the airflow limitation, reduces symptoms and reduces bronchial hyper-responsiveness to various respiratory stimuli. This has not been confirmed in a larger long term study of children with milder asthma. Although nedocromil was shown to be effective, we did not address the relative effects of this drug in relation to inhaled steroids, where the effects of treatment have been well established. Nedocromil sodium has a good safety profile, although there is a lack of head to head trials comparing nedocromil with inhaled corticosteroids to establish relative effects of the drugs on symptoms, lung function, especially in mild asthma where the requirement for inhaled steroids may not be as profound as it is with more severe asthma. The only significant side effect observed was unpleasant taste. Although there were no appreciable short term and long-term side effects, it is difficult to conclude the long-term safety of nedocromil sodium in childhood asthma based on only one study. It is not yet clear where nedocromil should sit in relation to other therapies in the treatment of asthma in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-10 09:52:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>1) Consistent methods of reporting symptoms aided by the development of a validated questionnaire (with established thresholds of clinical importance) would greatly assist in the interpretation of symptom changes in response to therapy.</P>
<P>2) More placebo controlled trails are required to assess the true efficacy of nedocromil. These trials should be large enough and of sufficient duration to allow the assessment of economically important outcomes such as hospital admission rates, primary care attendance and days missed from work/school due to asthma exacerbations. Studies should include mild and moderate asthma over longer periods. </P>
<P>3) Improved reporting of primary study methods, particularly details of how patients are allocated to treatment groups in line with <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK> recommendations would improve the accuracy of systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>4) Assessment of any potential clinically relevant effect of nedocromil sodium in the treatment of asthma will be best achieved by a further systematic review assessing trials in which patients have been randomised to nedocromil and inhaled corticosteroids within the same trial such as the CAMP study (<LINK REF="STD-CAMP" TYPE="STUDY">CAMP</LINK>). </P>

<P>Funnel plot to show that the distribution of effect estimates from the studies shows that there is a propensity of large, imprecise, positive effect estimates in the smaller studies. The non-significant effect is reported in the large study, suggesting that the fixed-effect may over-estimate the true effect for this population.</P>
