<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-05 14:16:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Individuals with coronary heart disease often suffer from severe distress, putting them at greater risk for complications, including sudden cardiac death. It is therefore important that the care of people with coronary heart disease focuses on psychological as well as physiological needs. Music interventions have been used for many years to reduce anxiety and distress and improve physiological responses such as heart rate and respiratory rate in medical patients. </P>
<P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2009 which suggested that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety and physiological responses in people with coronary heart disease but the quality of the evidence was not strong and the clinical significance unclear. </P>
<P>For this review, we searched for additional trials on the effect of music interventions on stress and anxiety in people with coronary heart disease. We searched for studies published up until November 2012 as well as ongoing studies until November 2012. We considered all studies in which any form of participation in music (e.g. listening to music, singing, playing music) was compared with any form of standard treatment and included persons with confirmed coronary heart disease. We identified four new trials for this update.</P>
<P>This review includes 26 trials with a total of 1369 participants. The trials were small in size. The findings suggest that listening to music may have a beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure and heart rate in people with coronary heart disease. Listening to music also appears to be effective in reducing anxiety in people with myocardial infarction, especially when they are given a choice of which music to listen to. Listening to music may also reduce pain and respiratory rate. However the size of the effects on pain and respiratory rate is small. Therefore, its clinical importance is unclear. Finally, listening to music appears to improve patients' quality of sleep following a cardiac procedure or surgery. We found no evidence of effect for depression or heart rate variability, and inconsistent results for mood. No adverse effects of music interventions were reported. The majority of the studies examined the effects of listening to pre-recorded music. More research is needed on the effects of music interventions offered by a trained music therapist. Overall, the quality of the evidence is not strong thus the results should be interpreted with caution. </P>
<P>We did not identify any conflicts of interests in the included studies.</P>

<P>Individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) often suffer from severe distress due to diagnosis, hospitalization, surgical procedures, uncertainty of outcome, fear of dying, doubts about progress in recovery, helplessness and loss of control. Such adverse effects put the cardiac patient at greater risk for complications, including sudden cardiac death. It is therefore of crucial importance that the care of people with CHD focuses on psychological as well as physiological needs.</P>
<P>Music interventions have been used to reduce anxiety and distress and improve physiological functioning in medical patients; however its efficacy for people with CHD needs to be evaluated.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality, seeking additional information from the trial researchers when necessary.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-27 13:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>We identified four new trials for this update. In total, the evidence for this review rests on 26 trials (1369 participants). Listening to music was the main intervention used, and 23 of the studies did not include a trained music therapist.</P>
<P>Results indicate that music interventions have a small beneficial effect on psychological distress in people with CHD and this effect is consistent across studies (MD = -1.26, 95% CI -2.30 to -0.22, P = 0.02, I² = 0%). Listening to music has a moderate effect on anxiety in people with CHD; however results were inconsistent across studies (SMD = -0.70, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.22, P = 0.004, I² = 77%). Studies that used music interventions in people with myocardial infarction found more consistent anxiety-reducing effects of music, with an average anxiety reduction of 5.87 units on a 20 to 80 point score range (95% CI -7.99 to -3.75, P &lt; 0.00001, I² = 53%). Furthermore, studies that used patient-selected music resulted in greater anxiety-reducing effects that were consistent across studies (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.36, P = 0.001, I² = 48%). Findings indicate that listening to music reduces heart rate (MD = -3.40, 95% CI -6.12 to -0.69, P = 0.01), respiratory rate (MD = -2.50, 95% CI -3.61 to -1.39, P &lt; 0.00001) and systolic blood pressure (MD = -5.52 mmHg, 95% CI - 7.43 to -3.60, P &lt; 0.00001). Studies that included two or more music sessions led to a small and consistent pain-reducing effect (SMD = -0.27, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.00, P = 0.05). The results also suggest that listening to music may improve patients' quality of sleep following a cardiac procedure or surgery (SMD = 0.91, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.79, P = 0.04).</P>
<P>We found no strong evidence for heart rate variability and depression. Only one study considered hormone levels and quality of life as an outcome variable. A small number of studies pointed to a possible beneficial effect of music on opioid intake after cardiac procedures or surgery, but more research is needed to strengthen this evidence.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-05 14:16:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joke Bradt">
<P>This systematic review indicates that listening to music may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in persons with CHD, especially those with a myocardial infarction. Anxiety-reducing effects appear to be greatest when people are given a choice of which music to listen to. </P>
<P>Furthermore, listening to music may have a beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, quality of sleep and pain in persons with CHD.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-05 14:16:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-28 09:21:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joke Bradt">
<P>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 17.3 million people worldwide die of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) each year. By 2030, the WHO predicts 25 million CVD deaths globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Heart disease has no geographical, gender, or socioeconomic boundaries (<LINK REF="REF-Chockalingam-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chockalingam 1999</LINK>). People with CHD often suffer from severe distress due to diagnosis, hospitalization, surgical procedures, uncertainty of outcome, fear of dying, doubts about progress in recovery, helplessness and loss of control (<LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolwerk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bolwerk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guzzetta-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guzzetta 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malan 1992</LINK>). This stress is likely to stimulate the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in increased heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure, myocardial oxygen demand and anxiety levels. Such adverse effects put the cardiac patient at greater risk for complications, including sudden cardiac death (<LINK REF="STD-White-1999" TYPE="STUDY">White 1999</LINK>). It is therefore of crucial importance that the care of people with CHD focuses on psychological as well as physiological needs.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-21 21:16:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>There is a great deal of literature, both quantitative and qualitative, regarding the use of music to reduce stress and anxiety in non-medical patients, and this provides the context and rationale for its hypothesized effects in people with CHD. Moreover, with non-medical patients, music is used both alone and as an adjunct to traditional stress-reduction approaches in therapy and for self-help procedures. Effects of music for stress reduction have been documented in physiological (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, hormonal levels), neurological (e.g. electroencephalographic (EEG) readings) and psychological domains (e.g. self report, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2007</LINK>). In addition, the effects of both music and music therapy interventions have been documented in a range of other medical patients, for example, pre-surgical, oncology, pediatric, and pre-procedural patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>). Moreover, anxiety and stress reduction is one of the primary outcomes investigated in music medicine and music therapy research with medical patients. Effects similar to those reported in the current review have been observed, and meta-analyses of these effects have been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Standley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standley 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Standley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standley 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2007</LINK> makes a clear distinction between music interventions administered by medical or healthcare professionals (music medicine) and those implemented by trained music therapists (music therapy). Interventions are categorized as 'music medicine' when passive listening to pre-recorded music is offered by medical personnel. In contrast, music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process, and the use of 'live' music experiences. These music experiences include: (1) listening to live, improvised or pre-recorded music; (2) performing music on an instrument; (3) improvising music spontaneously using voice or instruments or both; (4) composing music; and (5) music combined with other modalities (e.g. movement, imagery and art).</P>
<P>Several investigators have examined the effects of music on a variety of outcomes in people with CHD, including heart rate (<LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis_x002d_Rollans-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Davis-Rollans 1987</LINK>), respiratory rate, blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>), myocardial oxygen demand (<LINK REF="STD-White-1999" TYPE="STUDY">White 1999</LINK>), hormone levels (<LINK REF="REF-Vollert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vollert 2002</LINK>), anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolwerk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bolwerk 1990</LINK>), and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-31 15:00:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As discussed in a recently published Cochrane systematic review on the effects of music interventions on pre-operative anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013</LINK>), a common theory regarding the anxiety-reducing effects of music is that music can help people focus their attention away from stressful events to something pleasant and soothing (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 2008</LINK>). Even though this is an important mechanism in anxiety reduction, it is important to emphasize that music does more than refocusing people's attention. It provides an aesthetic experience that can offer comfort and peace while awaiting a cardiac procedure or surgery or the outcome of a myocardial infarction. In music interventions provided by a trained music therapist, the music therapist furthermore adapts the live music interactions to the in-the-moment needs of the participants. This often provides a deeply humanizing and validating experience for the patient. The act of making music together can provide a strong sense of support. Moreover, the active and creative engagement in music making (e.g. singing songs, improvising music) stands in stark contrast with passively submitting oneself to cardiac procedures or surgery. This may result in an increased sense of control and empowerment.</P>
<P>It has been postulated that music induces relaxation through its impact on automated and central nervous responses (<LINK REF="REF-Gillen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillen 2008</LINK>). More specifically, it is believed that the anxiolytic effect of music is achieved through its suppressive action on the sympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased adrenergic activity and decreased neuromuscular arousal (<LINK REF="REF-Chlan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillen 2008</LINK>). Music furthermore triggers the limbic system in the brain to release endorphins; these neurotransmitters play an important role in enhancing a sense of well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Arslan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arslan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="REF-Gillen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillen 2008</LINK> has suggested that more research is needed to examine the physiological mechanisms that explain the anxiolytic effects of music. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-05 14:16:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Although there are no hypothesized responses to music unique to this population, the effects of music on heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and anxiety have been widely studied both in people with or without medical conditions. These outcomes have heightened significance when it comes to cardiac patients, and a systematic review of the existing data is therefore much needed.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The previous version of this review found that music listening may have a beneficial effect for people with CHD and may reduce blood pressure and heart rate. Listening to music also appeared to be effective in reducing anxiety in people with myocardial infarction (MI) upon hospitalization. It has therefore been recommended that music listening be offered as a stress management intervention to people with MI upon hospitalization.</P>

<P>Since participants cannot be blinded in a music intervention trial, we did not downgrade studies for not blinding the participants. As for personnel, in music therapy studies music therapists cannot be blinded because they are actively making music with the participants. In contrast, in music medicine studies, blinding of personnel is possible by providing control group participants with headphones but no music (e.g. a blank CD). Downgrading for not blinding personnel was therefore only applied in studies that used listening to pre-recorded music.</P>

<P>We entered all trials included in the systematic review into Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Revman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revman 2012</LINK>). The main outcomes in this review were physiological responses and psychological responses (anxiety, pain, mood) presented as continuous variables. We used post-intervention scores for the meta-analysis. In the case of multiple music sessions, we used post-intervention data from the last session. In the case of statistically significant baseline differences, we computed change scores (i.e. changes from baseline) according to the guidelines provided by the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) for outcome measures using results from different scales, and weighted mean differences for results using the same scales. Studies for which change scores were used were not included in standardized mean difference analyses. For cross-over trials, we used only data from the first phase of the trials. We calculated pooled estimates using the fixed-effect model unless there was significant heterogeneity (I² &gt; 50%), in which case we used the random-effects model to obtain a more conservative estimate. We calculated the 95% confidence interval for each effect size estimate.</P>

<P>We had planned the following subgroup analyses a priori, but not all could be carried out because of an insufficient number of studies:<BR/>
<BR/>1. Music medicine versus music therapy (as defined by the authors): could not be conducted because only three music therapy studies were included in this review.<BR/>2. Different levels of engagement in music experiences (listening, singing, playing instruments): could not be conducted because the majority of the studies used music listening as the intervention.<BR/>3. Patient-selected music versus researcher-selected music: was conducted for those outcome variables for which the pooled estimate was heterogeneous.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Patient-type:<BR/>The included studies presented three distinct population groups: (a) myocardial infarction patients, (b) surgical or procedural patients, and (c) rehabilitation patients. Although we did not determine this subgroup analysis a priori, the review authors decided it was important to conduct a subgroup analysis comparing the effect on these three groups of studies for those outcome variables for which we found significant heterogeneity.</P>

<P>The database searches and handsearching of conference proceedings and journals of the original review (2009) resulted in 702 citations. One review author (JB) examined the titles and abstracts, and retrieved 77 references for possible inclusion. Two review authors then independently screened them, resulting in 29 references to 22 studies that met all the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one references to 20 studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but were excluded upon further examination (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). A further twenty-seven references turned out not to be relevant to this review as they were program descriptions, review articles, and case studies, or used a combination of treatments (e.g. music and aroma therapy).</P>
<P>The 2012 update of the search resulted in 216 extra citations. One review author (NP) examined the titles and abstracts and retrieved full-text articles where necessary.

<P>We included 24 (92%) trials that used appropriate methods of randomization (e.g. computer-generated table of random numbers, drawing of lots, flip of coins), one trial that used alternate group assignment as the allocation method, and one trial that reported using randomization but failed to state the randomization method.</P>
<P>Eighteen trials (69%) used allocation concealment whereas three trials did not. For the remainder of the trials, allocation concealment was not mentioned.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2013-12-02 19:26:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In music intervention studies, participants cannot be blinded (unless in studies that compare different types of music interventions). Two studies that used music listening reported blinding personnel. This was achieved by having both music group and control group participants wear headsets and listen to a compact disk (CD). The control group listened to a blank CD. In music therapy trials, the music therapist cannot be blinded, given the interactive nature of the music-making in the session.</P>
<P>Ten trials reported blinding of the outcome assessors for objective measures. For seven trials, the use of blinding was unclear. The other trials did not use blinding. However, it is important to point out that in case of assessment of subjective outcomes through self-report measures, blinding is often not possible since participants know whether they received the music intervention or a no-music control condition. Only in comparative studies (e.g. studies that compare active music-making with passive listening to music) can participants be blinded to the intervention and can their self report be considered blinded as well (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2012</LINK>). We would like to point out that the 'Risk of bias' figure (Figure 4) lists one study as having used blinding for subjective outcomes. However, this study did not include subjective outcomes. A rating of low risk was assigned if studies did not include subjective outcomes.</P>
<P>The lack of blinding of outcome assessors for objective outcomes as well as the inability to blind participants to their self report of subjective outcomes inevitably introduces the potential for biased assessment. As blinding of intervention allocation is not possible in music interventions, this added another layer of possible bias.</P>

The funnel plots for anxiety and heart rate indicate that there may be publication bias. However, it is also possible that the two smaller studies that appear in the lower part of the funnel plots were of lesser quality and, consequently, resulted in exaggerated effect sizes.

<P>The study reports did not suggest other potential sources of bias.</P>
<P>As a result of the risk of bias assessment, we concluded that two trials were at moderate risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Jafari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jafari 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leist-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leist 2011</LINK>). All other trials were at high risk of bias. The main reason for assigning a high risk of bias rating was the lack of blinding. As mentioned before, blinding is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless in studies where the music intervention is compared to another treatment intervention (e.g. progressive muscle relaxation or different type of music intervention). It therefore appears impossible for these types of studies to be rated at a low or even moderate risk of bias, even if all other risk factors (e.g. randomization, allocation concealment, etc.) have been adequately addressed.</P>
<P>Risk of bias is detailed for each trial in the risk of bias tables included with the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and in the 'Risk of bias' Summary (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

<P>As all but two trials were rated at the same level (high risk), we did not carry out sensitivity analysis on the basis of overall quality rating.

<P>Five studies examined the effects of music listening on psychological distress by use of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) (<LINK REF="STD-Cadigan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cadigan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hermele-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hermele 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leist-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leist 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2010</LINK>) and one study by means of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) (<LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2007a</LINK>). The pooled estimate of those studies that used the POMS (N = 228) indicated a small beneficial effect of music interventions on distress, and this result was consistent across studies (mean difference (MD) = -1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.30 to -0.22, P = 0.02, I² = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2007a</LINK> (N = 68) did not find statistically significant differences for psychological distress between the music therapy group and the standard care control group at posttest but did find an effect size of 0.54 at four-month follow-up.</P>
<P>Sixteen studies examined the effects of music on anxiety, seven of which reported mean state anxiety as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Nine studies reported mean anxiety measured by other scales such as numeric rating scale and visual analogue scale.</P>
<P>We first conducted an overall analysis of studies that used the STAI to measure anxiety as well as those that used other scales. In order to pool the effect sizes of studies that use different scales, we only included studies that reported post-intervention scores in the analysis.The standardized mean difference (SMD) of those studies (10 studies, N = 353) that reported post-intervention anxiety scores, regardless of the scale used, revealed a moderate (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>) effect favoring music interventions (SMD = -0.70, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.22, P = 0.004), but results were inconsistent across studies (I² = 77%). Grouping the studies by participant type (myocardial infarction (MI) patients, surgical/procedural patients, rehabilitation patients) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) did not resolve heterogeneity. However, grouping the studies by music preference led to homogeneous results for the four studies (N = 144) that used participant-selected music (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.36, P = 0.001, I² = 48%) but not for the five that used researcher-selected music (N = 179) (SMD = -0.74, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.08, P = 0.08, I² = 85%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>When pooling studies that only used STAI State Anxiety form (STAI-S) to measure state anxiety (seven studies, N = 310), significantly lower state anxiety was found in participants who received standard care combined with music interventions than those who received standard care alone (MD = -4.58, 95% CI -7.78 to -1.39; P = 0.005). However, considerable statistical heterogeneity remained (I² = 88%). Six out of these seven studies included participants with MI and one study included surgical patients. Pooling the results of only the MI studies (N = 243) resulted in a larger effect size that was more homogeneous (MD = -5.87, 95% CI -7.99 to -.3.75, P &lt; 0.00001, I² = 53%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.1).</P>
<P>We then explored whether music preference affected the outcome of state anxiety as measured by STAI-S. Grouping the studies by whether participant-preferred music (three studies, N = 167) or researcher-selected music (four studies, N = 143) was used did not reduce heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). However, as noted above, all studies in this subgroup analysis were MI studies except for one (<LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>). A subsequent analysis from which we excluded this surgical study suggested a greater anxiety-reducing effect and homogeneity for studies that used participant-preferred music. Studies of people with MI (two studies, N = 100) that used participant-preferred music resulted in an average anxiety reduction of 7.36 units on the STAI (95% CI -9.45 to -5.27, P &lt; 0.00001, I² = 0%) compared to a reduction of 4.68 units for those studies that used researcher-selected music (four studies, N = 143) (95% CI -8.27 to -1.10, P = 0.01, I² = 66%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pooled estimate for studies that measured anxiety by scales other than the STAI-S (seven studies, N = 248) suggested no strong evidence of an effect (SMD = -0.43, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.06, P = 0.09). Here too, results were statistically heterogeneous (I² = 70%). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cutshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cutshall 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2010</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis because change scores were used. <LINK REF="STD-Cutshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cutshall 2011</LINK> reported a small effect size of -0.12 (95% CI -0.51 to 0.27) in 100 participants, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2010</LINK> (N = 36) resulted in an effect size of -0.35 (95% CI -1.01 to 0.31). Neither effect size was statistically significant. Grouping the studies by type of participant resulted in a larger pooled estimate for surgical/procedural patients (four studies, N = 171) but heterogeneity remained (SMD = -0.63, 95% CI -1.25 to -.0.01, P = 0.05, I² = 73%). Three studies with MI and rehabilitation patients (N = 77) did obtain a homogeneous effect but this effect was very small and did not reach statistical significance (SMD = -0.03, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.56, P = 0.93; I² = 31%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). A subgroup analysis on the impact of music preference suggested that the use of participant-preferred music (four studies, N = 144) resulted in a large anxiety reduction that was statistically significant and consistent across studies (MD = -0.89, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.36, P = 0.001, I² = 48%). In contrast,researcher-selected music (in this case, classical music was used) appeared to slightly increase anxiety although this was not statistically significant (three studies, N = 104) (SMD = 0.11, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.49, P = 0.58, I² = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies (N = 217) included depression as an outcome. Their pooled estimate indicated that participants who listened to music did not significantly differ in their reported levels of depression from those participants who received standard care (SMD =  -0.11, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.16, P = 0.42, I² = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies (N = 97) used a numeric rating scale to measure the effects of music on mood. Their pooled estimate indicated that participants who listened to music reported greater mood enhancement than those receiving standard care (SMD = 1.08, 95% CI -0.02 to 2.17, P = 0.05); however, there was disagreement between the two studies about the size of the effect (I² = 80%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). The results are therefore inconclusive.</P>

Grouping the studies by type of participant (MI, surgical/procedural, rehabilitation) reduced heterogeneity for surgical/procedural patient studies (seven studies, N = 604) somewhat (I² = 54%) but the effect was no longer statistically significant (MD = -2.61, 95% CI -5.62 to 0.34, P = 0.09). For studies with MI patients (5 studies, N = 194), the effect remained statistically significant but the results were highly inconsistent across studies (MD =-4.75, 95% CI -9.26 to -0.25, P = 0.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). </P>
<P>A subgroup analysis by participant-selected versus researcher-selected music produced interesting results. The pooling of studies that used researcher-selected music (six studies, N = 398) resulted in a smaller but homogeneous effect size (MD = -2.67, 95% CI -4.27 to -1.07, P = 0.001; I² = 0%). The use of participant-selected music (seven studies, N = 430) resulted in a larger effect size (MD = -4.69, 95% CI -9.40 to 0.02, P = 0.05); however, the results were highly inconsistent between studies (I² = 84%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>

<P>Pooling the studies that used researcher-selected music (four studies, N = 256) had a similar effect on heterogeneity as for the heart rate outcome: the use of researcher-selected music led to a smaller but homogeneous effect size (MD = -1.66, 95% CI -2.20 to -1.12, P &lt; 0.00001, I² = 0%). The use of participant-selected music (three studies, N = 186) resulted in a larger but heterogeneous pooled estimate (three studies, MD = -4.42, 95% CI -7.37 to -1.46, P = 0.003, I² = 89%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The results of 10 studies (N = 353) suggest that listening to music has a moderate anxiety-reducing effect in people with coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the results were inconsistent between studies, which were generally small and at high risk of bias, and therefore, need to be treated with caution.</P>
<P>Studies using the same scale (STAI) to measure anxiety obtained consistent anxiety-reducing effects of music (5.87 units on a 20- to 80-point score range) in people with myocardial infarction (MI). A reduction of 5.87 units may be considered small; however, mean baseline STAI scores were relatively low to begin with (ranging from 35.3 to 48.2). In all MI studies, anxiety was reduced after the music intervention to STAI levels that are considered to represent low anxiety. Greater anxiety-reducing effects were found for studies that used participant-preferred music than for those that used researcher-selected music.</P>
<P>The pooled estimate of five studies (N = 228) suggests that music has a small beneficial effect on psychological distress and this difference was consistent across studies.</P>
<P>We found no evidence of an effect of music on depression (six studies; N = 217). This finding is consistent with those of other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions with cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>) and with patients at end-of-life (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010a</LINK>). This result suggests that short-term interventions (one or two music sessions) focused on acute symptom reduction (e.g. state anxiety, pain, distress) are inadequate to relieve depression. The treatment of depression may need a more long-term regimen of music therapy sessions that actively uses the relational aspects of music-making to address the psychotherapeutic needs of the participants rather than focusing on symptom relief.</P>
<P>The pooled estimate of two studies (N = 97) suggests that music listening may enhance mood. However, this finding was not statistically significant. More studies are needed to further evaluate the effect of music on mood as evidenced by the inconsistencies of results across these two studies.</P>
<P>One music therapy study (N = 88) included quality of life as an outcome in a population of cardiac rehabilitation patients. Because of significant rates of attrition in this study, we could draw no conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physiological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Results of this review suggest that listening to music reduces heart rate. However, there was variation among the 13 studies (N = 828) on the size of this effect. In examining the source of the heterogeneity, we discovered that listening to participant-selected music resulted in a heart rate reduction of 4.69 beats per minute (bpm) compared to 2.67 bpm when listening to researcher-selected music. However, in contrast to participant-selected music, the results were consistent across studies when researcher-selected music was used, i.e. no statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>In two small studies (N = 90) there was no evidence for an effect of music on heart rate variability.</P>
<P>For respiratory rate, the use of researcher-selected music also led to smaller (reduction of 1.66 breaths per minute) but consistent results (four studies, N = 256), whereas the use of patient-selected music led to larger (4.42 breaths per minute) but inconsistent results (three studies, N = 186).</P>
<P>Pooled estimates indicate that music reduces systolic blood pressure by 5.5 mm Hg consistently across studies (11 studies, N = 775). No evidence of an effect was found for diastolic blood pressure (nine studies, N = 685).</P>
<P>Only one study (N = 60) examined the effects of music listening on myocardial oxygen demand and found a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand in contrast to the standard care group. No evidence of benefit was apparent for music on blood oxygen saturation (three studies, N = 184).</P>
<P>One study (N = 58) reported on the effect of music on cortisol levels but found no evidence for an effect. It is surprising that no other studies examined the effects of music on hormone levels that are of particular relevance to people with CHD, including adrenaline and noradrenaline concentration and other stress hormones that can be deleterious to cardiac functioning.</P>
<P>A small effect was found for music listening on self-reported pain; however the results were inconsistent across studies (eight studies, N = 630). Excluding those studies that only used one music session led to a small effect that was consistent across studies (three studies, N = 210).</P>
<P>The pooled estimate of two studies (N = 90) points to a small but non-significant effect of music on reduced need for opioid pain relief.</P>
<P>Finally, music listening appears to improve patients' quality of sleep following a cardiac surgery or procedure (two studies, N = 122).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-13 13:05:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes 26 randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials.</P>
<P>All but two trials used music listening as the clinical intervention. Twenty-three trials were categorized as music medicine trials, meaning that the music was administered by non-music therapist medical personnel. This clinical uniformity adds to the strength of this review but also limits the applicability of the evidence. The evidence, as presented in this review, speaks only to the effect of listening to music provided by the researcher or selected by the participant from music choices presented by the researcher. This review does not include enough music therapy studies to present evidence on the effects of music therapy interventions, wherein the person is actively involved in a therapeutic process in which a variety of musical experiences (e.g. music improvisation, singing) are used. The data from the three music therapy studies were not analyzed separately because of this small number of studies and because of clinical diversity.</P>
<P>No data can currently be provided regarding costs or cost effectiveness of music medicine applications in cardiac care, as these data were not included in the studies reviewed. Furthermore, no data were provided regarding costs for music therapy interventions, so that no comparisons between these two types of treatments can be conducted. It is recommended that future research include cost effectiveness measures of these two interventions, as well as cost comparisons between them.</P>
<P>The trials in general included very limited information about the music selections used, except for mentioning general music styles (e.g. classical, easy listening, jazz, country). Needless to say, music within each of these styles can vary widely, and more detailed information would help clinicians make well-informed music selections. In several trials, only classical music choices were offered without a good rationale for the music selection. In several trials, participants were allowed to select the music from that which was offered. This decision was based on the assumption that music preference plays an important part in the effectiveness of music relaxation. Certainly, allowing participants to select music that they like may enhance their sense of control; the power of this should not be underestimated as hospitalized people often feel helpless and disempowered. The results of this review indeed suggest that the use of participant-selected music resulted in greater anxiety reduction and more consistent results across studies than the use of researcher-selected music. However, it needs to be noted that participants could only select from a limited number of music styles presented by the researcher. It is likely that the preferred music of some of the participants was not included in the music selection offered and, even if it was, that they may not have liked the specific composition or song being played. One study explicitly stated that three participants withdrew from the study because they disliked the music (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>). Another researcher reported that some participants indicated that they would have preferred different music or that they did not care for the music (<LINK REF="STD-Bolwerk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bolwerk 1990</LINK>). We suspect that using music that is truly preferred by the participant may lead to even greater anxiety reduction.</P>
<P>In addition, musical parameters of the music choices offered to participants varied more widely than those of researcher-selected music. This could explain why trials that used participant-selected music had more heterogeneous results for physiological outcomes than trials using researcher-selected music. The results suggest that different music styles (e.g. jazz, country and western, classical, new age, etc.) affect the heart rate and respiratory rate differently. This is not surprising, given the knowledge that music is able to entrain or exert influence on the rate of physiological responses in patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2009b</LINK>). More research is needed to evaluate the effect of music that is truly patient-preferred as well as the effect of music with different characteristics (tempo, timbre, harmony, emotional intensity, etc.).</P>
<P>The majority of the studies only provided one music session to the participants. Because not all studies in this review addressed all main outcome variables, it was not possible to conduct a subgroup analysis to examine frequency and duration of sessions as moderator variables. <LINK REF="STD-Winters-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 2005</LINK> compared the effects of multiple music sessions during the course of a day and found that offering two or three music sessions had greater effects than one or no music sessions on various physiological and psychological responses in individuals after a MI. Offering multiple music listening sessions allows for the participant to give feedback about the music, select different music if needed, and become more skilled in using music for relaxation purposes. In the case of music therapy interventions, multiple sessions allow for the development of a therapeutic relationship and deepening of the therapeutic process through the music. This may lead to greater health benefits. At this time, however, the relationship between the frequency/duration of treatment and treatment effect remains unclear. Further investigation is needed into the optimal frequency and duration of music interventions for people with CHD. </P>
<P>Since the vast majority of participants in these trials were white (90%), generalizability to other ethnic groups is limited. Cultural sensitivity in music selection should always be considered.</P>
<P>Because only a small number of trials investigated the effect of music listening on mood, quality of life, myocardial oxygen demand, stress hormone levels, opioid intake, length of hospital stay, and quality of sleep, this evidence is not clinically applicable at this time. More research is needed.</P>

<P>The quality of reporting in general was poor with only a few authors detailing the method of randomization, allocation concealment, and level of blinding. We needed to contact the chief investigators of most studies to provide additional methodological and statistical information. For many outcomes in this review, there were inconsistencies in effects among studies. In addition, the trials included were generally small (Mean trial size = 64; median = 58) resulting in a lack of precision of treatment effects as evidenced by the rather large confidence intervals. This, combined with the high risk of bias, requires that the results of this review be interpreted with caution. In summary, the quality of evidence was low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>The strength of our review is that we searched all available databases and a large number of music therapy journals (English, German, and French language), checked reference lists of all relevant trials, contacted relevant experts for identification of unpublished trials, and included publications without language restrictions. In spite of such a comprehensive search, it is still possible that we have missed some published and unpublished trials. We requested additional data where necessary for all trials we considered for inclusion. This allowed us to get accurate information on the trial quality and data for most trials and helped us make well-informed trial selection decisions.</P>
<P>We were able to identify several unpublished studies through communication with experts in the field. It is possible that we did not identify some grey literature, but it is doubtful that this would have a significant impact on our results.

<P>We found no other systematic reviews on music interventions with cardiac patients.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to update the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2009a</LINK>) with the results of trials completed during the four years since its publication. Overall, the results of this review are similar to those of the previous version. The review was expanded with some additional outcomes that are of importance to healthcare costs associated with the treatment of CHD, namely length of hospital stay and opioid intake. However, at this time, there were not enough studies with these outcomes to provide strong evidence for an effect of music interventions on these outcomes.</P>
<P>The anxiety-reducing effects of music interventions found in this review are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music with mechanically-ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010b</LINK>), cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>), and pre-surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-05 14:17:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>This systematic review indicates that listening to music may have a beneficial effect for people with coronary heart disease (CHD). The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that listening to music may reduce systolic blood pressure and heart rate and also appears to be effective in reducing anxiety in people with myocardial infarction (MI) upon hospitalization. These results are consistent with the anxiety-reducing benefits of music interventions reported in three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music with mechanically-ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010b</LINK>), cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>), and pre-surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013</LINK>). </P>
<P>All music medicine studies in this review used sedative music or music that is calming. However, there are many styles of sedative music (e.g. new age, classical, country and western, easy listening, etc.) and, at this time, it is unclear which type of music is most effective. The results of this review furthermore suggest a differential impact of researcher-selected versus participant-selected music on anxiety as well as physiological responses. The results suggest that more consistent yet smaller effects sizes are found in physiological responses when researcher-selected music is used. However, for psychological outcomes such as anxiety, the findings suggest that patient-preferred music leads to greater benefits. </P>
<P>Listening to music may also reduce pain and respiratory rate; however the magnitude of these effects is small. It may also improve patients' quality of sleep after a cardiac procedure or surgery. We found no evidence of effect for depression, heart rate variability, and length of hospitalization. Some studies suggested beneficial effects of music listening on opioid intake but this effect was not statistically significant. Inconsistent results were found for mood. However, only a small number of trials investigated the effects of music on these outcomes.</P>
<P>It is important to note that only three studies in this review used a trained music therapist. Music therapists in medical settings do not limit their interventions to offering music listening for relaxation purposes. Music therapists are specially trained clinically and academically to carefully select music interventions to offer emotional and spiritual support, enhance a sense of control, and improve physical well-being in medical patients. Because of the lack of randomized controlled trials examining the effect of music interventions offered by a trained music therapist for people with coronary heart disease, it is impossible to establish at this time whether these interventions are more effective than listening to pre-recorded music.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-05 14:17:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>This systematic review provides evidence that listening to pre-recorded music may have health benefits for individuals with CHD. The use of other music therapy interventions, such as music improvisation, singing, listening to live music, songwriting, amongst others, with this population needs more research.</P>
<P>The effects of researcher-selected versus participant-selected music need to be further examined. In particular, studies are needed that use music that truly reflects participant preference. In addition, future trials should investigate the differential effects of researcher-selected versus participant-selected music. Future research needs to discuss in greater detail specific characteristics of the music selections. We recommend that researchers consult the reporting guidelines for music-based interventions developed by Robb, Burns, and Carpenter (<LINK REF="REF-Robb-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The music therapy literature recommends that when music is used for sedative purposes, patients select music that is characterized by a slow tempo and lack of abrupt changes and sharp timbres. In addition, music that evokes strong emotional reactions, which may be caused by intense memories associated to the music, should be avoided when used for stress and anxiety reduction purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2007</LINK>). These recommendations stem from the clinical experience and knowledge of music therapists as well as experimental research in the field of music psychology. More controlled trials are needed with medical patients to further examine which musical characteristics enhance the psychological and physiological benefits from music listening.</P>
<P>Besides music characteristics, more information is needed about dosages as well as timing of music interventions. Future studies need to examine the relationship between the frequency/duration of music interventions and treatment effects.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Are there optimal lengths of music interventions?</LI>
<LI>Do multiple sessions lead to better results?</LI>
<LI>For people with MI, are there preferred times during the day?</LI>
<LI>For procedural patients, what is the most effective time to start the music intervention?</LI>
<LI>Should the music intervention continue after completion of the procedure, and if so, for how long?</LI>
<LI>Does listening to music several days or weeks prior to it being used during the procedure impact outcomes differently than listening to the music for the first time just prior to or during the procedure?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Comparative studies are needed to answer many of these questions. Only one study in this review compared the effects of different dosages (once, twice, and three times per day) and timing (morning, afternoon, and evening) of music listening interventions in people with MI. In addition, future studies should examine the impact of patients' preferred coping strategies on the effectiveness of anxiety-reduction interventions such as music listening. Some people may prefer distraction through music listening during a procedure, whereas others may prefer to closely monitor the procedure. None of the included studies considered preferred coping style as a possible confounding variable. The use of culturally relevant music needs to be considered when designing protocols for further research.</P>
<P>In addition, as recommended by <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1994</LINK>, patient personality traits (especially trait anxiety) and pre-procedural state anxiety need to be considered as impact factors in future studies. People with high levels of trait and state anxiety may report differential benefits from music interventions than those with low levels of anxiety.</P>
<P>Furthermore, several authors recommend that future studies exert better control over the confounding effects of beta-blockers, and other cardiac medication, as well as opioids (<LINK REF="STD-Cadigan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cadigan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sendelbach-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sendelbach 2006</LINK>) on physiological and physical responses.</P>
<P>In summary, more studies are needed to examine the effects of music interventions on quality of life, mood, and depression in people with CHD, as these are factors relevant to the disease itself. In addition, future studies need to examine the effects of music on physiological responses beyond heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate variability, myocardial oxygen demand, blood oxygen saturation levels, and stress hormone levels may provide more sensitive measures of effect and may, moreover, provide insight into the underlying physiology of anxiety and stress reduction. We also recommend that future studies consider duration of cardiac procedures as well as long-term outcomes such as length of hospitalization and survival and death.</P>
<P>Few studies in this review included a power calculation. Future studies need to include power calculations so that sufficiently large samples are used.</P>
<P>Formal evaluation of the costs and benefits of music medicine and music therapy is needed.</P>

<P>The following subgroup analysis was not included in the protocol:</P>
<P>A comparison of (a) MI patients, (b) surgical or procedural patients, and (c) rehabilitation patients. Although this subanalysis was not determined a priori, the reviewers decided it was important to conduct a subanalysis comparing the effect of these three groups of studies for those outcome variables for which significant heterogeneity was found.</P>
<P>The original review only included randomized controlled trials. For the update of this review, we decided to also include quasi-randomized controlled trials and conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of such trials on the effect size.</P>
<P>Finally, an explicit statement was added to the method section regarding the exclusion of studies with participants who did not all have a confirmed CHD.</P>
