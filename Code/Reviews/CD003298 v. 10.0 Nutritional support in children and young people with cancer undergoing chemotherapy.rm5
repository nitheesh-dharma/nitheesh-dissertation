<TITLE>Nutritional support in children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-03 10:05:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The provision of safe, appropriate and effective nutritional support for children and young people undergoing treatment for cancer is now well recognised as an important part of their care. It may help to reverse malnutrition seen at diagnosis, prevent malnutrition associated with the cancer, promote weight gain and growth and improve quality of life. Nutritional support may be provided by one of two methods: intravenous nutritional liquids delivered through a central or peripheral vein which bypass the gut (parenteral nutrition); or nutritional liquids or solids that pass through any part of the gut, regardless of method of delivery (e.g. orally or via a tube; enteral nutrition).</P>
<P>We found evidence from one small trial to suggest that parenteral nutrition may result in an increase in weight, serum albumin levels and calorie and protein intake when compared to enteral nutrition (usual food intake). However, the effect of other methods of delivery of nutritional support remains unclear. Results from another small study suggested that the use of energy dense enteral feeds resulted in greater average daily energy intake and subsequently improved weight gain. Three studies looked at glutamine supplementation and did not show a benefit from its use. One study looked at the effect of using olive oil based parenteral feeds rather than those containing standard fats and found that it lead to less weight gain. One study considered the effect of adding fructooligosaccharide to enteral feeds and found that it did not effect the amount of weight gained or how often participants felt nauseated. No studies were identified that compared the nutritional content in either the PN or EN groups of studies. The trials were all of low quality and very different in terms of outcome measures used. In the future, much larger, rigorously conducted trials are needed in order to address this important question.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:41:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is well documented that malnutrition is a common complication of paediatric malignancy and its treatment. Malnutrition can often be a consequence of cancer itself or a result of chemotherapy. Nutritional support aims to reverse malnutrition seen at diagnosis, prevent malnutrition associated with treatment and promote weight gain and growth. The most effective and safe forms of nutritional support in children and young people with cancer are not known.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:41:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of any form of parenteral (PN) or enteral (EN) nutritional support, excluding vitamin supplementation and micronutrient supplementation, in children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and to determine the effect of the nutritional content of PN and EN. This is an update of a previous Cochrane review.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:41:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases for the initial review: CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CINAHL (1982 to 2006), the National Research Register (2007) and Dissertations &amp; Theses (2007). Experts in the field were also contacted for information on relevant trials. For this update, we searched the same electronic databases from 2006 to September 2013. We also scrutinised the reference lists of included articles to identify additional trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-03 10:05:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current review included the eight trials from the initial review and six new trials which randomised 595 participants (&lt; 21 years of age) with leukaemias or solid tumours undergoing chemotherapy. The trials were all of low quality with the exception of two of the trials looking at glutamine supplementation. One small trial found that compared to EN, PN significantly increased weight (mean difference (MD) 4.12, 95% CI 1.91 to 6.33), serum albumin levels (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.26), calorie intake (MD 22.00, 95% CI 5.12 to 38.88) and protein intake (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.15). One trial comparing peripheral PN and EN with central PN found that mean daily weight gain (MD -27.00, 95% CI -43.32 to -10.68) and energy intake (MD -15.00, 95% CI -26.81 to -3.19) were significantly less for the peripheral PN and EN group, whereas mean change in serum albumin was significantly greater for that group (MD 0.47, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81, P = 0.008). Another trial with few participants found an increase in mean energy intake (% recommended daily amount) in children fed an energy dense feed compared to a standard calorie feed (MD +28%, 95% CI 17% to 39%). Three studies looked at glutamine supplementation. The evidence suggesting that glutamine reduces severity of mucositis was not statistically significant in two studies (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.2 and RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.1) and differences in reduction of infection rates were also not significant in two studies (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.4 and RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51). Only one study compared olive oil based PN to standard lipid containing PN. Despite similar calorie contents in both feeds, the standard lipid formula lead to greater weight gain (MD -0.34 z-scores, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.00). A single study compared standard EN with fructooligosaccharide containing EN. There was no difference in weight gain between groups (mean difference -0.12, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.33), with adverse effects (nausea) occurring equally between the groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.74).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:42:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence from individual trials to suggest that PN is more effective than EN in well-nourished children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The evidence for other methods of nutritional support remains unclear. Limited evidence suggests an energy dense feed increases mean daily energy intake and has a positive effect on weight gain. Evidence suggesting glutamine supplementation reduces incidence and severity of mucositis, infection rates and length of hospital stay is not statistically significant. Further research, incorporating larger sample sizes and rigorous methodology utilising valid and reliable outcome measures, is essential.<BR/>

<P>Childhood cancers differ from those seen in adults in both type and outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Task-Force-on-Cancer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Task Force on Cancer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boklan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boklan 2006</LINK>). Children have tumours that respond better to chemotherapy, and children tolerate chemotherapy better than adults do (<LINK REF="REF-Marsoni-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsoni 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balis 1997</LINK>). Children also differ metabolically from adults and continued growth and development are desired throughout therapy that often spans several years.</P>
<P>Progressive nutritional depletion is frequently seen in cancer patients, manifested by anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, muscle wasting, fat mass loss and impaired immune function. The initial nutritional problems resulting from the tumour are soon compounded by iatrogenic nutritional abnormalities, the consequence of the treatment and its complications. Anorexia, mucositis, vomiting, diarrhoea and alterations in taste are important contributory factors to weight loss seen in children and young people undergoing treatment for cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Barr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barr 2002</LINK>); metabolic and psychological factors also have a role (<LINK REF="REF-Mauer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mauer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Cutsem-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Cutsem 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Meyenfeldt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Meyenfeldt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Antoun-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoun 2006</LINK>). The consequences of malnutrition are serious, with children who are underweight at diagnosis having a poorer outcome compared to those who are adequately nourished at diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Argiles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Argiles 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lange-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange 2005</LINK>). Malnutrition contributes to a reduced tolerance to therapy, and protein calorie intake may affect sensitivity to chemotherapy agents (<LINK REF="REF-Andressy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andressy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sala-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sala 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ladas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladas 2005</LINK>). Malnutrition may also contribute to problems of drug toxicity due to altered pharmacokinetics secondary to changes in body composition, and the relationship between body surface area and lean body mass (<LINK REF="REF-Ladas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tambori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tambori 2005</LINK>). In addition, the relationship between malnutrition and increased infection rates is well documented in the child with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Taj-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taj 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sala-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sala 2004</LINK>). However, the evidence regarding the effect of malnutrition at diagnosis or during treatment on overall survival is unclear and may depend on the disease and its extent (<LINK REF="REF-Weir-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaris 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sala-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sala 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:43:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nutritional support involves the administration of nutrients in place of, or in addition to, that provided by normal eating and incorporates interventions relating to the methods of delivery (e.g. via parenteral or enteral route) and/or nutritional content (e.g. glutamine supplementation, high energy density). Enteral nutrition (EN) is defined as any method of supplying nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract. It includes the intake of oral food and fluids, but usually indicates the use of nasogastric, nasojejunal, gastrostomy or jejunostomy feeding, which are generally referred to as enteral tube feeding. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the administration of intravenous nutrition that bypasses the gastrointestinal tract. PN can be administered via a peripheral or central line. Central lines allow infusion of  more concentrated solutions and therefore can maximise nutritional intake in fluid restricted patients or those with higher nutrient requirements, and are suitable for long term parenteral nutritional support. The nutritional constituents of the parenteral or enteral feed usually include as a minimum amino acids, glucose, fat, electrolytes, vitamins and trace elements.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:44:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main aims of nutritional support are to reverse any malnutrition seen at diagnosis, prevent any future malnutrition associated with treatment and to promote normal weight gain and growth. Nutritional support should improve immune competence, tolerance to treatment and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ladas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladas 2005</LINK>). Successful nutritional support must take the form of the most safe, appropriate and effective method for children and young people with cancer.</P>
<P>Children and young people undergoing treatment for cancer are at risk of depleted nutrient stores due to a decreased oral intake or increased losses due to vomiting, diarrhoea or renal losses. They are often unable to meet their nutritional requirements by oral food intake alone due to problems such as mucositis, taste changes, nausea or a poor appetite, and enteral or parenteral nutritional support is frequently instigated. In general, EN tends to be the method of choice in children and young people undergoing treatment for cancer as it is practical and has advantages over PN including a lower risk of infection and other catheter related complications. It helps to preserve the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, reduces the risk of bacterial translocation and is more economical (<LINK REF="REF-Han_x002d_Markey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han-Markey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deswarte_x002d_Wallace-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deswarte-Wallace 2001</LINK>). PN tends to be reserved for when the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning or cannot be accessed or for patients whose enteral feed regimen cannot provide enough nutrients. PN is commonly indicated for children and young people treated for cancer who develop severe mucositis and enteritis. Other indications include typhlitis, neutropenic enterocolitis, ileus, chylous ascites post surgery or severe graft verus host of the gut following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Metabolic and infection related complications of PN are well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Beghetto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beghetto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koletzko-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koletzko 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yilmaz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yilmaz 2007</LINK>). It has been proposed that careful consideration is recommended before commencement of PN due to its limited nutritional benefit if given for less than one week; fluid replacement therapy may be given instead (<LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the last decade, novel substrates such as glutamine are increasingly being added to feeds to enhance nutritional support. It is thought that glutamine support may improve nutritional and immunological parameters in children and reduce the risk of mucositis whilst receiving chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okur-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Okur 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK>). Choosing the most effective and safe form of nutritional support is essential, yet current knowledge relating to evidence for nutrition support is poor (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-03 10:08:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prior to the last version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>), two non-Cochrane reviews were conducted, which were in need of updating (<LINK REF="REF-McGeer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGeer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>). One indicated that PN, when compared with control (not defined), had a detrimental effect: decreased survival, poorer tumour response and a significant increase in infectious complications. This review included studies of children, but the literature search was restricted to MEDLINE (<LINK REF="REF-McGeer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGeer 1990</LINK>). The other narrative review of randomised controlled trials aimed to evaluate separately the clinical efficacy of PN and EN in children and adults with cancer undergoing a variety of treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and BMT (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>). The review concluded that PN made no difference to survival or haematological or gastrointestinal toxicity, worsened tumour response rates and increased infection rates. No obvious therapeutic benefit was seen with respect to survival, tumour response or chemotherapy toxicity in the EN studies. This review was assessed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), York. The CRD concluded that they were unable to determine the completeness of the review in terms of the resources searched and the methods used for quality assessment. The review was limited to inclusion of English language studies.</P>
<P>The aim of the current review was to update the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>), examine any new evidence in terms of the effectiveness of any form of nutritional support (PN or EN) and/or nutritional content of enteral/parenteral nutrition, focusing on children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.</P>

<P>One form of nutritional support compared with another or with no nutritional support (i.e. usual food intake, fluid therapy).</P>
<P>Nutritional support is defined here as the administration of nutrients in place of or in addition to normal eating and incorporates interventions relating to method of delivery (e.g. via parenteral or enteral route) and/or nutritional content (e.g. glutamine supplementation, high energy density feeds, high fibre feeds). It excludes specific vitamin or micronutrient supplementation, as these strategies differ from those of general nutritional support in their prescription and their aims, for example bone health and vitamin D.</P>
<P>No nutritional support comprises:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Usual food intake - defined here as oral feeding from a selection of foods that are eaten by the patient as part of their normal diet.</LI>
<LI>Fluid therapy (FT) - the administration of a solution of glucose, saline and electrolytes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>PN is the intravenous administration of nutrients containing, as a minimum, glucose and amino acids. It is administered through the central or peripheral venous system and therefore bypasses the gastrointestinal tract. PN normally consists of a standardised PN solution containing proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and electrolytes that may have additions of vitamins, trace elements or glutamine.</P>
<P>EN is the delivery of any substance of nutritional value in solid or liquid form that passes any part of the digestive tract, regardless of the method of delivery (orally or via a tube, e.g. nasogastric, nasojejunal, gastrostomy, jejunostomy). Since EN also includes usual food intake, for the purposes of this review it can be considered to be a form of no nutritional support or control, e.g. selection of favourite foods and/or beverages, as well as a form of nutritional support, e.g. oral calorie supplements added to usual food intake, calorie dense or hydrolysed or elemental formulas delivered via a tube.</P>
<P>Examples of interventions that could have been compared include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>PN versus EN, e.g. PN versus usual food intake, PN versus enteral tube feeding.</LI>
<LI>EN versus EN, e.g. nasogastric versus usual food intake, nasogastric versus gastrostomy, usual food intake and oral calorie supplements versus usual food intake alone.</LI>
<LI>PN versus PN, e.g. peripheral PN versus central PN, PN and glutamine versus PN alone.</LI>
<LI>PN and EN versus PN alone.</LI>
<LI>PN and EN versus EN alone.</LI>
<LI>PN versus FT.</LI>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-08-03 10:12:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original review three authors (LJ, RW, SW) independently extracted data (using a customised data extraction form designed by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group). Where information was lacking, those reviewers contacted primary authors for clarification.</P>
<P>They analysed the different nutritional support interventions identified within the following comparative groups: PN versus EN (usual food intake); EN (nasogastric) versus EN (usual food intake); PN and EN versus PN; and PN versus FT. Statistical analysis of data from nine out of a total of 16 outcomes was possible. Varying numbers of trials were included in each analysis. They reported the remaining outcomes narratively because the clinical endpoints and measurements differed widely across trials.</P>
<P>To avoid duplicate reporting of outcome data from 14 of the patients enrolled in a single-centre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ghavimi-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ghavimi 1982</LINK>) that were also enrolled into a multi-institutional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1982</LINK>) on PN versus EN, where both trials reported on the same outcome measure, the authors of the original review only entered the data from one of the trials into the statistical analysis. They took the following approach when looking at the effects of interventions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>When both studies provided outcome data in a format amenable to analysis, they reported both sets of results narratively and only incorporated the data from the multi-institutional study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1982</LINK> into an analysis (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, number of deaths).</LI>
<LI>When both studies provided outcome data, but only one study provided it in a format amenable to analysis (e.g. mean, standard deviation), they reported both sets of results narratively and only incorporated the data from the study which provided the data in an appropriate format into an analysis (arm anthropometry).</LI>
<LI>For some outcomes both studies presented data either only narratively or in a format not amenable to analysis; in these instances they reported both sets of outcome data narratively (arm muscle circumference, serum albumin).</LI>
<LI>For all other outcomes, only one of the studies reported on a particular outcome and so duplicate reporting of data was not an issue (arm circumference, infection rate).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For the review update, two authors (EW, LH) independently extracted the data and checked the data from each included study using a customised data extraction form based on that used for the original review.</P>
<P>The new studies included in the updated review addressed different questions regarding the benefit of nutritional support compared to the original review. The additional areas were: the benefit of energy dense or fibre supplemented nasogastric feeds, the value of glutamine supplementation and the comparative value of different lipid formulations for PN.</P>
<P>Varying numbers of trials were included in each analysis, either statistical or narrative. There were no issues with duplicate reporting in the trials added to this review.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-30 15:47:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original review, three authors (LJ, RW, SW) independently assessed the methodological quality of the selected trials. The evaluation of methodological quality was based on the method described by Jüni as outlined below (Jüni 2001).</P>
<P>For this update, two review authors (EW, LH) assessed the risk of bias of each study independently. The following aspects that may cause bias were examined: selection bias (including sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (including blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (including blinding of outcome assessors), attrition bias (including incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (including selective outcome reporting) as described in the latest module of the Childhood Cancer Group (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/CHILDCA/frame.html">CCG 2012</A>), which is based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). Where a mixture of subjective and objective outcomes were present, and outcome assessment was undertaken without blinding, we chose to take the 'worst case' approach and describe all outcomes as having high risk of bias. We assessed each trial to see if the study was free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting by comparing the outcomes described in the methods section to the reported in the results section as a proxy, as original trial protocols were not available. If other biases particular to the study type or intervention were thought possible, these were recorded as 'Other bias' (for example, the use of an unverified and unreported symptom questionnaire may have introduced bias). Each item was scored as having a low, high, or unclear risk of bias. In case of disagreement between the two review authors, a third review author (RSP) assessed the risk of bias. The assessments in the original review were also updated.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-07-30 16:23:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials were eligible for inclusion in the previous review, which encompassed four comparisons: four trials of PN compared to EN (usual food intake) in well-nourished patients (n = 80); one trial of EN (nasogastric) compared to EN (usual food intake) in malnourished patients (n = 12); two trials of PN (peripheral) and EN (usual food intake) compared to central PN alone in malnourished patients (n = 37); and one trial of PN compared to FT in patients with mucositis (n = 30). The majority of trials were published more than 17 years ago.</P>
<P>In the studies comparing PN to EN there was limited evidence from one small trial that suggested PN was beneficial in terms of increasing body weight, serum albumin levels, and calorie and protein intake when compared to EN. The evidence for other methods of delivery of nutritional support was also limited to single studies and remains unclear. One trial comparing peripheral PN and EN (usual food intake) with central PN found that mean daily weight gain and energy intakes were significantly lower for the peripheral PN and EN group (<LINK REF="STD-Rickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 1989</LINK>), whereas another trial found that mean change in serum albumin was significantly greater for the peripheral PN and EN group (<LINK REF="STD-Rickard-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 1985</LINK>). In the one study comparing EN (nasogastric) versus EN (usual food intake), the only significant finding was that mid-upper arm circumference was significantly greater in the nasogastric group at six weeks follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). In the one most recent study comparing PN to FT, all the data for change in nutritional indices were reported as medians and so it was not possible to analyse the data in forest plots (<LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2006</LINK>). The study does report narratively that weight gain significantly increased in the PN group compared to the FT group where weight remained stable, whereas fat-free mass and total body water decreased in the PN group compared to the FT group (<LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2006</LINK>). However, P values were not reported and so it is not possible to ascertain whether these results are statistically significant. It is worth noting that there was no significant difference between the PN and FT group in terms of number of culture-positive infections.</P>
<P>A further six trials were eligible for inclusion in the current review, which encompassed a further four comparisons: one trial of energy-dense EN compared to standard calorie content EN (n = 27); one trial of FOS supplemented EN compared to a non-FOS EN (n= 67); three trials comparing glutamine-supplemented EN (oral or nasogastric) or PN compared to standard non-glutamine-supplemented EN (oral or nasogastric) or PN (n = 288); and one trial of an olive oil-derived lipid PN compared to standard lipid PN (n = 28). All six trials were published between 2000 and 2011.</P>
<P>The current study therefore did not highlight any new significant evidence in terms of method of nutritional support as the newly included trials investigated nutrient content (energy density, FOS, glutamine and oliveoil-derived PN lipid) rather than method of delivery. Therefore the questions addressed by the initial review regarding the most effective method of nutritional support in children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy remains unanswered, with the initial review reporting limited evidence from one small trial that compared to EN, PN significantly increased weight gain, serum albumin levels, calorie intake and protein intake (<LINK REF="STD-Hays-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hays 1983</LINK>). There have been no subsequent studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria which focused on the method of nutrient delivery by comparing EN with PN or oral food intake/oral nutritional supplements with EN or PN.</P>
<P>One study in the current review comparing an energy dense enteral feed (1.5 Kcal/ml) to a standard calorie feed (1.0 Kcal/ml) reported, as expected, a significantly greater mean energy intake in the energy dense feed group which resulted in a significantly higher increase in z-score of weight for height in the energy dense enteral feed group compared to the standard formula group after 10 weeks of feeding (<LINK REF="STD-den-Broeder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">den Broeder 2000</LINK>). However the evidence is limited due to the small sample size and unclear risk of bias. The study comparing an FOS supplemented feed compared to a non fibre containing feed showed no difference in terms of nutritional indices (weight, albumin and pre albumin). Although less abdominal pain and diarrhoea were reported in the FOS supplemented feed group, this was not significant and the risk of bias in the study was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the three studies comparing glutamine supplementation, two as EN in standard chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK>) and after HSCT (<LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK>) and the third added to PN after HSCT (<LINK REF="STD-Uderzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uderzo 2011</LINK>), no significance was found in change in nutritional indices. Infection rates were reported in both <LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uderzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uderzo 2011</LINK> but no significant difference was reported in either study. Nausea and vomiting was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK> with no significance in terms of severity or duration between courses of chemotherapy with or without glutamine supplementation. The glutamine supplementation showed no significant improvement in severity of mucositis in any of the three studies. Slightly higher treatment related mortality rates were reported in the glutamine supplemented groups in <LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uderzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uderzo 2011</LINK> compared to the non glutamine controls (11% versus 9%, non-significant). <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK> did not report length of stay but both <LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uderzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uderzo 2011</LINK> found no difference in length of hospital stay between the two groups. Previously there have been several studies looking at the role of glutamine supplementation in adult oncology patients (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2009</LINK>), however there are very few published studies looking at glutamine in children with cancer. The current review highlights the fact that evidence for the use of glutamine supplementation either enterally or parenterally in children treated for cancer is weak, particularly following HSCT. <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2009</LINK> had a high risk of bias, but both <LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uderzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uderzo 2011</LINK> had a low risk of bias yet found no significant benefit to glutamine supplementation.</P>
<P>The final study in the current review looked at an olive oil based parenteral lipid compared to a standard parenteral lipid in a small number of BMT patients (Hartman 2009). After 14 days the plasma lipid profile of those tested in the study remained favourable. Despite no difference in calorie intake between the two lipid groups, a greater increase in weight gain average z-score in the standard lipid group was observed. The study period was only 14 days so it remains unclear if there are any potential adverse effects or abnormal lipid profiles if an olive oil based lipid was to be given for a longer period of time.</P>
<P>The question addressed by this review was broad in scope, and consequently a number of comparisons of nutritional interventions were included. The advantages of the broad scope are that the review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence to date. The studies in the previous review focused mainly on the method of delivery of the nutritional intervention. As more studies have become available, this review has been able to address the nutrient content within the parenteral or enteral feed (e.g. high energy dense EN, FOS containing feeds, glutamine supplementation and olive oil based PN). The included studies consisted of children and young people with cancer who were described as being either malnourished or well-nourished at the beginning of the nutritional therapy. In the trials that examined the usage of PN versus EN (usual food intake), the interventions were clinically heterogenous. In some trials, both the PN and EN groups (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 1982</LINK>), or the EN group alone (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Eys-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Van Eys 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghavimi-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ghavimi 1982</LINK>), received additional dietary advice or counselling, and in one trial both groups were allowed oral nutrition as tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Hays-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hays 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>A diverse range of clinical endpoints for each of our specified primary and secondary outcomes were reported in the trials. Due to this, and the inconsistencies in expression of results and statistical reporting across trials (for example, measures of change in weight were reported in a variety of ways), it was not possible to include many of the outcome measures in the statistical analyses. Meta-analysis was therefore only possible for two outcome measures: infection rate and mortality. Furthermore, most of the outcome measures included in the statistical analysis consisted of data from only one or two trials. The use of a diverse range of clinical outcome measures is a common theme amongst Cochrane reviews of nutritional interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Poustie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poustie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cairns-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Omran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Omran 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soghier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soghier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dewey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahlungulu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahlungulu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2009</LINK>). Recent work highlights the fact that more methodological research is needed in defining pertinent outcome measures in paediatric trials (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2008</LINK>). Future work in this important area could lead to a more clearly defined set of core outcomes for measuring the effectiveness and safety of nutritional interventions in paediatric oncology trials. An insufficient number of trials within each of the comparisons, and lack of consistent outcome data presented within the included trials, meant we were unable to use sensitivity and subgroup analyses to examine effects of methodological quality of trials, the condition of individuals (i.e. severity of disease, nutritional status in terms of malnourished or well-nourished), type of malignancy or type/intensity of chemotherapy. Future studies should be multi-centre trials with standard outcome measurements.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials was generally poor with only four trials reporting 'adequate' methods of allocation concealment and six trials reporting 'adequate' methods for sequence generation. Three of the studies attempted blinding of clinicians and participants, and two of the studies attempted blinding of outcome assessors. Selective outcome reporting bias was also a concern in three of the included trials. All of the included trials were small with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Aquino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aquino 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uderzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uderzo 2011</LINK>, which each had over 100 participants.</P>
<P>In summary, the previous review identified four main comparisons of nutritional interventions: PN versus EN; EN versus EN; PN and EN versus PN; and PN versus FT. The evidence suggests that: PN may be more effective than EN in terms of greater weight gain, serum albumin levels and calorie and protein intake; CPN is more effective than PPN and EN in terms of greater weight gain and energy intakes; and PPN and EN is more effective than CPN in terms of greater serum albumin levels. However, much of the evidence was limited to single studies. The evidence for other comparisons remains unclear as data were limited to one or two small trials with a diverse range of clinical outcome measures.</P>
<P>Evidence in the current review additionally suggested that a higher calorie intake and subsequently better weight gain is achievable by using an energy dense enteral feed; an FOS containing feed was well tolerated but demonstrated no significant difference in terms of nutritional indices, abdominal pain or diarrhoea compared to a standard enteral feed; and similarly, an olive oil based parenteral lipid was tolerated for a limited period of time in terms of plasma lipid profile but there was no significantly clear clinical benefit to its use. The evidence was limited to small single studies. There was evidence from three studies relating to the use of enteral or parenteral glutamine, two of which had a low risk of bias. The evidence for all three studies was weak with regard to the benefits of glutamine supplementation, showing no reduction in the incidence or severity of mucositis, infection rates or length of hospital stay.</P>

<P>There is limited evidence from individual trials to suggest that PN is more effective than EN in well-nourished children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. There is limited evidence to suggest that glutamine supplementation given either enterally or parenterally has no significant effect on mucositis, infection rates or length of hospital stay. The evidence for other comparisons and in malnourished patients remains unclear. Until results of adequately-powered, preferably multi-centre trials with clear outcome measures are available, nutritional support needs to be selected on an individual basis following a discussion involving the patient, the carers (if appropriate) and the multidisciplinary treatment team, which should include a dietitian experienced in managing oncology patients. The possible benefits and harms of any nutritional support must be discussed with the patient. <B>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Differences between the original protocol and original review</HEADING>
<P>In the original protocol we stated that we would consider studies where participants were children aged 18 years or less. Once the search for studies had been conducted, a post hoc change to the review was made. We changed the inclusion criteria to participants up to the age of 21 years. This change was made because several paediatric oncology units in the UK and elsewhere now accept patients of 18 years and older. There has also been a recent trend to extend the upper age limit for inclusion in paediatric oncology trials to 21 years.</P>
<P>In the original protocol we specified that we would consider studies that included the following outcomes:</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes:</B>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Nutritional status as measured by weight change, biochemical indices.</LI>
<LI>Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or any other outcomes examined which may be associated with the feeding or chemotherapy regimen.</LI>
<LI>Infection rate (catheter-related sepsis or any other infection).</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes:</B>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Death.</LI>
<LI>Remission of cancer (tumour response, other measures of disease progression).</LI>
<LI>Measures of quality of life.</LI>
<LI>Length of hospital stay/frequency of admissions.</LI>
<LI>Cost.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Once data had been extracted on outcomes and the review completed it was decided, based on peer review comments, that the original outcome measures were too broad and these were defined more precisely as outlined in the Methods section under '<LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>'.</P>

<LI>Explicit exclusion of vitamins and micronutrient supplementation has been introduced into this review. This change is driven by the different often pharmacological nature of these supplements, and the different outcomes which they are intended to promote (for example, bone health in Vitamin D supplements).</LI>
<LI>Inclusion of mucositis and abnormal biochemical profiles as outcomes. This was motivated by the inclusion of glutamine supplementation which was hypothesised to reduce mucositis and thereby improve nutritional absorption, but concerns were raised of hyperammonaemia as a side effect. Different lipid formulations for PN were hypothesised to cause dyslipidaemia, and this was included as an outcome.</LI>

<P>EN (nasogastric) - median duration = 4 weeks, range 3 to 6 weeks</P>
<P>Subjects commenced supplementary nasogastric feeding as soon after diagnosis as possible.<BR/>The feeding routine for nasogastric was flexible, with the expectation that most children would eventually receive nasogastric feeding overnight at home. Feeding was usually commenced at a continuous infusion of 10 ml/h and was increased by 10 ml/h/day, if tolerated. If children were in bed throughout most of each 24-hour period, nasogastric feeding was continued throughout the 24 hours. In children were more active by day, feeding was restricted to 10 to 14 hours overnight. Once MAC was documented to be increasing, no attempt was made to increase total daily intake any further. Nasogastric feeding was continued until MAC was above the tenth percentile for at least 2 weeks.</P>
<P>Follow up was for a period of 3 months from diagnosis. This permitted study during the most intensive phase of disease specific treatment.</P>
