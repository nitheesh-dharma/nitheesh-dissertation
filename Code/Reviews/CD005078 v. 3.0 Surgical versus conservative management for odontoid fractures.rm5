<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-21 15:15:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The seven bones making up the neck region of the backbone are called the cervical vertebrae. The first vertebra, called the atlas, supports the skull. Underneath this is the axis or second vertebra, which has a upward pointing process called the odontoid process around which the atlas can rotate, enabling the head to be turned. Fracture of the odontoid process is a serious injury and is often fatal. In survivors there is a risk of ongoing damage to the spinal cord and paralysis. People with these fractures are often treated conservatively, which entails stabilisation of the neck in devices such as a 'Halo' (external frame) and/or rigid collar for several months. Another option is surgical stabilisation of the fractured parts. The review aimed to examine the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing surgical versus conservative treatment for these fractures to find if either approach gave a better outcome. Despite a comprehensive search, the review authors found no evidence from completed randomised controlled trials to inform the choice between surgical and conservative management.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 15:49:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-29 12:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-09-29 12:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The odontoid process (also called the peg) is a bony projection of the second cervical vertebra (C2), around which the ring-shaped first cervical vertebra (atlas or C1) can rotate. Behind the odontoid process runs a strong ligament, the transcervical ligament of the axis, which separates it from the spinal cord. This unique arrangement, which allows rotational movement of the head, is known as the atlanto-axial complex.</P>
<P>Odontoid fractures typically result from flexion (i.e. anterior movement of the head on the neck) injury, and occasionally from extension (posterior head movement) injury. Due to the proximity of vital neural structures, fracture of the odontoid process may result in fatal damage to the cervical spine, as the fracture is highly unstable. Some 25% to 40% of fractures are estimated to be immediately fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2001</LINK>). Amongst survivors, failure of the fracture to unite is frequently associated with progressive neurological damage (<LINK REF="REF-Crockard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockard 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Odontoid fractures have been classified by Anderson and D'Alonzo into three main categories (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1974</LINK>). Type I is an oblique (slanting) fracture through the upper portion of the odontoid process, and is considered relatively stable. The most unstable injuries, type II fractures involve the base of the odontoid peg at the junction with the C2 body. A sub-classification added by <LINK REF="REF-Hadley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 1988</LINK> is the type IIa fracture, which is a comminuted (fragmented) type II fracture. Type III fractures are odontoid fractures which extend into the body of C2, and are considered more stable than type II lesions.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 15:36:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>In view of the potentially fatal nature of the injury, treatment aims to re-establish stability of the atlanto-axial complex by restoring the odontoid process. This may be achieved by conservative or surgical approaches. Conservative approaches include the application of a cervical collar (with or without prior traction) or the use of an external immobilisation device (the 'Halo' or 'Minerva' devices). Use of the cervical collar alone has been shown in case series to yield fusion rates approaching 100% in type I fractures, approximately 55% in type II, and 50% to 60% in type III injuries. The use of traction has been demonstrated to increase the fusion rate in type III fractures to around 80% (with no discernable difference in types I or II) (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2002</LINK>). The rate of non-union in type II fractures is related to age, with non-union rates 21 times higher in the over than in the under fifties (<LINK REF="REF-Lennarson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennarson 2000</LINK>); and also to displacement of the dens fragment (86% non-union when there is more than six millimetres of displacement, compared with 18% when there is less) (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical options include posterior fusion of the C1 and C2 vertebrae using wire/cable instrumentation. This prevents subluxation (slippage) of the C1 vertebra on C2, and case series have demonstrated fusion rates of 87% and 100% for type II and III fractures respectively. Fusion may also be performed with screws via a posterior approach (<LINK REF="REF-Campanelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campanelli 1999</LINK>). This procedure has a reported morbidity and mortality rate of between 2% and 4%. Specific complications include vertebral artery injury and new onset neurological deficit. C1 to C2 fusion also causes atlantoaxial movement to be lost, leaving the patient unable to rotate their head. Screw fixation of the odontoid peg itself is an alternative surgical option. This involves placing screws through the body of C2 via an anterior approach which is more technically challenging and may be precluded by body habitus (a person's physique) or fracture geometry. Case series have demonstrated success rates of 90% to 95% for type ll fractures, and 100% for type III. Two screw, rather than one screw, fixation may produce a slightly higher fusion rate (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1998</LINK>). These techniques have a significant complication rate, including retropharyngeal wall injury (resulting in airway compromise), infection, implant breakage, loosening and misplacement causing neurovascular injury, although atlantoaxial motion is preserved.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-09-21 15:17:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The following consensus has been reached in contemporary clinical practice based on retrospective case series (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2002</LINK>): conservative management in all instances initially, with consideration of surgical fixation in type II fractures in the over fifties, type IIa (comminuted) fractures, type II and III fractures with displacement over five millimetres, and failed conservative management. It is also widely acknowledged that aggressive surgical management in elderly patients may not be in their best interests.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-31 06:43:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Odontoid fracture is a potentially devastating injury. It is clearly important to confirm whether surgical management is superior to conservative management for such injuries. We aimed to review the literature systematically to identify and evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing surgical and conservative interventions for odontoid fractures.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-09-29 12:33:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to compare the relative effects of surgical versus conservative treatment in all classes of acute (i.e. not failed management cases), isolated (i.e. not combined with other cervical vertebral fractures) odontoid fracture in all patient groups (paediatric, adult and elderly age groups), irrespective of any co-morbidities). We planned to assess treatment effects primarily in terms of neurological injury resulting from spinal instability, rates of radiographic bony fusion, complications of conservative and surgical management, and pain and function.</P>

<P>Radiological bony fusion was selected as the main outcome measure as it is widely considered and quoted as representing successful treatment. Expert opinion suggests a minimum of 18 months follow-up to confirm whether or not this has taken place (<LINK REF="REF-Julien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Julien 2000</LINK>). Interobserver variation exists, and various criteria have been suggested (but not uniformly adopted) for diagnosing radiological non-union on standard 3-view plain cervical radiography (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2001</LINK>). Prompted by editorial feedback on the review, we added pain, function and activities of daily living, and death.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-09-21 15:55:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Our comprehensive search failed to identify any completed randomised controlled trials to inform the choice between surgical and conservative management of these fractures. This is consistent with the findings of others, such as <LINK REF="REF-Maak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maak 2006</LINK>, who have conducted literature reviews on the treatment of these fractures. The published literature to date consists of retrospective case series and case-control studies. While we may have missed unpublished trials, randomised trials comparing surgery versus conservative treatment can be challenging to do and we do not think that a successfully performed trial would have gone unnoticed.</P>
<P>We identified an abstract report of a randomised controlled trial addressing type II fractures only (<LINK REF="STD-Hurlbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlbert 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hurlbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlbert 2007</LINK> presented an interim analysis of 29 patients and reported on non-union and subsequent surgery. They concluded that a further 20 patients were required to meet the sample size target. It is hoped that the sample size target will be met by the time of our next update.</P>
<P>We identified one meta-analysis of the available evidence with regard to type II fractures only (<LINK REF="REF-Nourbakhsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nourbakhsh 2009</LINK>). This concluded that operative treatment provides a significantly better fusion rate than external immobilisation in older patients (over 55 years), posteriorly displaced fractures, and fractures displaced over 4-6 millimetres. We also identified one prospective, non-randomised trial comparing conservative and surgical management in type II odontoid peg fractures in the elderly which is currently recruiting patients (<LINK REF="STD-Vaccaro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vaccaro 2008</LINK>). This two-centre study aims to recruit 166 patients in five years, ending in August 2009.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-21 15:55:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>There is a need for reliable evidence to clarify best practice in this area. As odontoid fractures are relatively uncommon, and patient recruitment may be slow,  a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial is required. Such a trial needs to have a minimum of two years follow-up and record bony fusion, complications resulting from spinal instability and treatment, pain and function, including activities of daily living of survivors.</P>
