<TITLE>Probiotics for treatment of <I>Clostridium difficile</I>
<I>-</I>associated colitis in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>
<I>Clostridium difficile</I> <I>(C. difficile)</I> is a bacterium that attaches itself to the gut wall and is responsible for causing severe diarrhea and sometimes death in patients who have undergone antibiotic therapy for unrelated diseases. Antibiotics tend to wipe out the "good" or protective bacteria in the gut which allows colonization with <I>C. difficile</I>. Probiotics are bacteria and yeasts that resemble the protective bacteria of the gut and have been used in several studies to treat <I>C. difficile</I> infection. Unfortunately, these small studies do not provide enough evidence to support the use of probiotics for treating <I>C. difficile</I> infection.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Probiotics are live microorganisms consisting of non-pathogenic yeast and bacteria that are believed to restore the microbial balance of the gastrointestinal tract altered by infection with <I>Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)</I>. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of antibiotic associated <I>C. difficile</I> colitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane IBD/FBD Specialized Trials register were searched to locate all published reports from 1966 to 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized, prospective studies using probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of documented <I>C. difficile</I> colitis were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and analysis was done independently by two authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The four studies examined the use of probiotics in conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the treatment of recurrence or an initial episode of <I>C. difficile</I> colitis in adults. The studies were small in size and had methodological problems. A statistically significant benefit for probiotics combined with antibiotics was found in one study. McFarland 1994 found that patients receiving <I>S. boulardii</I> were significantly less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience recurrence of <I>C. difficile</I> diarrhea (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98). No benefit of probiotics treatment was found in the other studies. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for <I>C. difficile</I> colitis. There is no evidence to support the use of probiotics alone in the treatment of <I>C. difficile</I> colitis. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The administration of antibiotics is known to be associated with the development of diarrhea in patients. Erythromycin and the clavulanate in amoxicillin-clavulanate cause diarrhea by accelerating gastrointestinal motility (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2002</LINK>). Other antibiotics are thought to cause diarrhea by reducing the number of fecal anaerobes, thereby decreasing carbohydrate digestion and absorption, leading to an osmotic diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2002</LINK>). Nearly 15% of hospitalized patients receiving beta-lactam antibiotics develop diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1995</LINK>). <I>Clostridium difficile</I> (<I>C. difficile</I>) infection of the colon is another cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea that is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of native or newly acquired <I>C. difficile</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Fekety-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fekety 1993</LINK>). <I>C. difficile</I> is implicated in 20 to 30% of patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea, in 50 to 70% of those with antibiotic-associated colitis and in more than 90% of those with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-George-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1994</LINK>). Approximately 5% of asymptomatic healthy adults carry low concentrations of <I>C. difficile</I> in their colon, and the growth of these bacteria has been shown in vitro to be held in check by normal gut flora (<LINK REF="REF-Fekety-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fekety 1993</LINK>). The exact mechanism by which <I>C. difficile</I> overgrowth occurs is still unclear, but it can occur with the administration of oral, parenteral or topical antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Fekety-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fekety 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>). Colonization with <I>C. difficile</I> usually occurs after ingestion of spores. These spores are able to tolerate the acidic environment of the stomach and attach to the gut, producing cytotoxic and enterotoxic effects. Patients can acquire <I>C. difficile</I> colitis within several days of initiation of antibiotic therapy to months after termination of the offending agent. The patients affected by <I>C. difficile</I> colitis vary from inpatient and outpatient settings, to those receiving chemotherapeutic agents and those who acquire it spontaneously. Conventional treatment includes vancomycin or metronidazole for ten days. However, recurrence occurs in 10 to 25% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Moyenuddin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyenuddin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2005</LINK>). The incidence of <I>C. difficile</I>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) ranges from 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 hospital discharges, depending on the antibiotic prescribing habits of the hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manian-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manian 1995</LINK>). Additionally, the incidence may change over time at the same hospital as it did in one study from approximately 1 in 300 to 1 in 100 hospital discharges (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The consequences of CDAD can be severe. Seventy nine deaths due to CDAD were reported in Quebec in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Pindera-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pindera 2004</LINK>). At one academic medical center over a three-year period, 21 of 710 cases (3%) of <I>C. difficile</I> colitis required intensive care unit admission or died as a result of their infection (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1995</LINK>). These deaths were associated with co-morbid conditions such as malignancy, COPD or renal failure and therapies such as immunosuppressive drugs, antiperistaltic medications or the prior administration of clindamycin (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1995</LINK>). At another university hospital the morbidity of <I>C. difficile</I> infection was higher and 24 of 157 patients (15.3%) with <I>C. difficile</I> colitis died from their infection (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK>). The economic consequences of <I>C. difficile</I> infection can also be severe, with one report finding a mean cost of $10,970 (US$) per patient for the treatment of the infection and its complications (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1999</LINK>). Of all these reports, those from Quebec are the most worrisome, and subsequent reports of mortality rates in that province are much higher than previous reports (<LINK REF="REF-Pepin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 2005</LINK>). This may be related to the appearance of a new variant of <I>C. difficile</I>, which is capable of secreting much higher amounts of toxin A &amp; B and greater resistance to standard antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Louie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louie 2005</LINK>). This new variant results in a greater incidence in hospitalized patients (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2005</LINK>), a greater need for urgent colectomy for toxic colitis and a mortality rate reported to be as high as 37% of incident cases (<LINK REF="REF-Pepin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 2005</LINK>). This variant, ribotype 027, has been reported in Quebec, the USA, and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Louie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louie 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Laurence-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurence 2006</LINK>). The emergence of this highly virulent bacterium adds an urgency to the identification of effective therapy. </P>
<P>It is important to explain the terms used in conjunction with <I>C. difficile</I> infection, as the studies analyzed in this review involve various descriptions of C. difficile disease. CDAD occurs in a patient with diarrhea that has tested positive for <I>C. difficile</I> toxin and/or positive stool culture of <I>C. difficile</I>. <I>C. difficile</I> colitis involves a stool test positive for the organism and signs of mucosal inflammation seen on endoscopy. Pseudomembranous colitis refers to the actual presence of pseudomembranes seen on endoscopy. These terms are extensively overlapping, but not necessarily synonymous, as many patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea do not undergo the endoscopy and biopsy necessary for the diagnosis of colitis or the endoscopy and visualization of pseudomembranes. This systematic review will use the term CDAD for all forms of symptomatic <I>C. difficile</I> infection for its analysis.</P>
<P>Probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to "improve the patient's microbial balance", a rather ill defined term applied particularly to the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina (<LINK REF="REF-Elmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elmer 2001</LINK>). They consist of non-pathogenic yeast and bacteria such as <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I>, <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</I> and <I>Lactobacillus acidophilus</I> and are found in cultured and fermented foods including yogurt, buttermilk, cheese and sauerkraut. The proposed mechanisms of action of probiotics include inhibition of pathogen adhesion, blocking production of microbial toxins, stimulation of the immune system and restoration of colonization resistance (which is the ability of normal microflora to prevent colonization by pathogenic organisms). None of these mechanisms has been established in efficacy studies, particularly in the case of CDAD. Although adverse effects from treatment with probiotics are rare, special consideration has been given to immunocompromised and severely debilitated patients as these high-risk groups are often prone to opportunistic infections even with benign organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Elmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elmer 2001</LINK>).</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized, controlled trials using probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of documented <I>C. difficile</I> colitis. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants were patients with documented CDAD. This includes patients with symptomatic diarrhea, those with stool positive <I>C. difficile</I> cytotoxin or positive culture for <I>C. difficile</I>, those with current or recent prior exposure to antibiotics, and those with absence of other pathogens in stool. Patients under 18 years of age were excluded from this study.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies comparing probiotics alone or in combination with traditional antibiotic therapy (metronidazole or vancomycin) for treatment of current or recurrent infection with <I>C. difficile</I> were included. Studies using probiotics for the prevention of C. difficile disease were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main outcome measures are resolution of diarrhea and negative stool <I>C. difficile</I> cytotoxin assay or culture. Secondary outcomes include recurrence of diarrhea, mortality, length of hospital stay and adverse events. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Specialized Trials register were searched using the following terms: antibiotic-associated diarrhea, <I>C. difficile</I> infection, probiotics, randomized trials. English language was not a restriction in the search. The online search was used to locate all published reports from 1966 to July 2007. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection <BR/>Two authors examined all citations and abstracts derived from the electronic search strategy and independently selected trials to be included in the review. Full reports of potentially relevant trials were retrieved. Reviewers were not blind to the names of trials' authors, institutions or journals. Any disagreement about trial inclusion was resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>Data extraction <BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract and record information on the results of the included studies. Results were compared between reviewers and differences of opinion settled by discussion. Where data may have been collected but not reported, further information was sought from the trials' investigators. </P>
<P>Quality assessment <BR/>The methodological quality of eligible trials was assessed independently by each author in terms of quality of random allocation concealment, number of withdrawals and dropouts, whether data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, and whether the participants and the outcome assessors were blind to the treatment provided. Where the method of allocation concealment was not clearly reported, the trials' authors were contacted for clarification. Studies were excluded if they were not randomized or if they made comparisons other than those specified. </P>
<P>Data analysis <BR/>Data were analyzed using the MetaView statistical package in Review Manager. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived for each study. When appropriate, the results of included studies were to be combined for each outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, a pooled RR and 95% CI were to be calculated using a fixed effects model. </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The initial search identified six studies which met the selection criteria. Two studies were subsequently excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Elmer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elmer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pochapin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pochapin 2000</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Pochapin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pochapin 2000</LINK> study was published as an abstract, and it did not contain experimental detail or a complete patient group. Attempts to reach the author to supply further information revealed that the study had been discontinued due to lack of efficacy. <LINK REF="STD-Elmer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elmer 1999</LINK> was excluded because the outcomes were not clinically relevant. The primary outcome was the concentration of <I>S. boulardii</I> in stool specimens. The study was subsequently published with complete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK>). The included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wullt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wullt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>) examined the use of probiotics used in conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the treatment of an initial episode or recurrent <I>C. difficile</I> infection. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK> study was conducted using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. One hundred and forty-seven outpatients with active <I>C. difficile</I> diarrhea (CDD), some with primary disease and some with recurrent disease, were enrolled. Twenty-three patients were excluded after entry because they were ineligible, leaving 124 patients in the study. Reasons for exclusion include negative C difficile assay (n = 10), failure to return enrollment forms (n = 6), receipt of exclusion drugs (n = 4), diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (n = 1), no current diarrhea (n = 1) and starting the study drug before the antibiotic (n = 1). All participants were treated with vancomycin or metronidazole. Dosages of antibiotics and duration of treatment were at the discretion of each patient's physician. Patients were randomized to <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> (1 g/day; 3 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> colony forming units; n = 57) or identical placebo (n = 67) for 4 weeks. Diarrhea cessation was defined as a return to normal bowel frequency (&lt; 3 loose or watery stools per day for at least 48 hours), negative <I>C. difficile</I> assay (culture or toxin) or endoscopic evidence of cure. This is the only study to report mortality. Five patients died during the study. One patient in the <I>S. boulardii </I>group<I> </I>died from pneumonia<I>.</I> Four placebo patients died due to <I>Staphylococcus</I> sepsis, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and prostate cancer.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK> study was a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of the treatment of adult patients with recurrent <I>C. difficile</I> associated disease. Recurrent <I>C. difficile</I> disease was defined as <U>&gt;</U> 1 previous episodes diarrhea that was positive for <I>C. difficile</I> and that had initially responded to antibiotic treatment. Two hundred and nine outpatients were initially enrolled; 41 did not meet the definition of recurrent C difficile disease or failed to fulfill eligibility criteria leaving 168 patients in the study. Treatment options included a 10 day orally administered course of high dose vancomycin (2 g/day; n = 32), low dose vancomycin (500 mg/day; n = 85) or metronidazole (1 g/day; n = 53). Choice of antibiotic as well as dosages were left to the discretion of the primary care physician, although those patients with severe CDD were given the higher dose of vancomycin. The study report focuses on high dose vancomycin because the lower dose of vancomycin and metronidazole were found to be ineffective. Patients in the high dose vancomycin group were randomized to oral <I>S. boulardii</I> (1 g/day; n = 18) or placebo (n = 14) for 28 days beginning on day 7 of antibiotic treatment. Diarrhea cessation was defined as a return to normal bowel frequency (&lt; 3 loose or watery stools per day for at least 48 hours). Patients were considered treatment failures if they developed a subsequent episode of <I>C. difficile</I>-positive diarrhea after the antibiotics were discontinued and before the end of the 2 month follow-up.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Wullt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wullt 2003</LINK> study recruited 29 patients with recurrent <I>C. difficile</I> infection (both inpatients and outpatients), of whom 21 were analyzed. Participants were given oral metronidazole 400 mg three times daily for ten days in combination with either <I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I> 299v (5 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> colony forming units per day; n = 12) or placebo (n = 9) once daily for 38 days. Clinical cure was defined as cessation of diarrhea within 5 to 10 days of initiation of treatment. Bacteriological cure was defined as a negative assay for <I>C. difficile</I> toxin on days 11 to 13. </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> study 15 patients with recurrent CDAD were randomized to receive <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosis GG</I> (<I>LGG</I>) (2.8 x 10<SUP>11</SUP> colony forming units; one capsule orally twice daily, n = 8) or placebo (n = 7) in conjunction with antibiotics as chosen by the primary clinician (metronidazole and/or vancomycin) for the duration of antibiotic therapy and for an additional 21 days. The primary outcome was recurrence of CDAD within 60 days of completing antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>Length of hospital stay was not reported, and two of the studies may have included outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Problems with quality occur in each included study.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK> study allocation concealment was adequate, withdrawals and dropouts were adequately described, and the procedures for double blinding were well described and appropriate. Withdrawals and dropouts were treated as treatment failures and an intention to treat analysis was used. However, patients with both recurrent and primary CDAD are included in the study. Antibiotic therapy was not randomly applied. The duration and dosing of metronidazole or vancomycin was varied in an unspecified number of patients during therapy. The authors did not specify when randomization occurred.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was adequate in the <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK> study and the procedures used for double blinding were appropriate. Antibiotic therapy was not randomly applied. No rationale was provided for starting probiotic therapy on day 7 of antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Wullt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wullt 2003</LINK> study allocation concealment was adequate and withdrawals and dropouts were adequately described. The drop-out rate was high (28%). An intention to treat analysis was not used. <LINK REF="STD-Wullt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wullt 2003</LINK> is the only study to use a standardized regimen for antibiotic therapy. </P>
<P>The details of the experimental protocol are not presented in detail in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> study. Procedures used for allocation concealment and blinding are unclear. The type of antibiotic and duration and dosing of antibiotic therapy are not adequately described. An intention to treat analysis was reported. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>: <BR/>Data were not pooled for analysis because of variations in recruitment criteria, the type of probiotic used, high drop out rates and variations in concommitant antibiotic therapy. Forest plots are grouped by probiotic type. </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK> study patients who received <I>S. boulardii</I> and antibiotic were significantly more likely than the placebo group to respond to therapy. The patients in the active treatment group were significantly more likely than placebo patients to experience cessation of diarrhea (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.74) and were significantly less likely to experience recurrence of diarrhea after cessation of antibiotic therapy (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98). Patients with recurrent <I>C. difficile</I> receiving <I>S. boulardii</I> were more likely than the placebo patients to respond to therapy. However, in those with initial episode of <I>C. difficile</I>, there were equal failure rates of treatment in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only the group receiving <I>S. boulardii</I> and high dose vancomycin showed a decreased frequency of recurrent CDD in the <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK> study (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.10 to 1.06). There was no significant change in outcome with <I>S. boulardii</I> versus placebo in the low dose vancomycin or metronidazole groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wullt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wullt 2003</LINK> performed the only study testing the benefit of <I>L. plantarum. </I> This study compared probiotic plus antibiotic to antibiotic alone. No statistically significant benefit was seen analyzing cure of initial disease (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.19), recurrence (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.35) or cure by stool assay (RR 0.75; 0.41 to 1.36). <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> found no significant benefit for therapy with <I>LGG</I> (RR 2.63; 95% CI 0.35 to 19.85). </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wullt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wullt 2003</LINK> reported no adverse events associated with <I>L. plantarum</I> treatment. The occurrence of adverse events was reported in the other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK> reported that there were no statistically significant differences in the number or type of adverse events in patients treated with <I>S boulardii</I> or placebo, and that no adverse events occurred during the four week follow-up period. <LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK> reported a statistically significant increase in thirst (P = 0.02) and constipation (P = 0.03) in patients receiving S boulardii compared to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> reported mild gastrointestinal upset with bloating (25%) and flatulence (37.5%) in patients treated with <I>LGG</I>.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McFarland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McFarland 1994</LINK> provides weak support for the use of probiotics (<I>S. boulardii</I>) in combination with antibiotics for the treatment of <I>C. difficile</I> disease. The <LINK REF="STD-Surawicz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Surawicz 2000</LINK> study reported a positive benefit for S. boulardii used in conjunction with high dose vancomycin. However, with such a small sample size a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn from this study. No benefit was seen in the other studies. The included trials were small in size and probably would have lacked the power to detect a statistically significant difference between probiotic and placebo should such a difference exist. Furthermore, the considerable clinical heterogeneity related to antibiotic use and initial disease state cited above are such that no recommendation can be made concerning probiotic therapy for established CDAD. There has been growing interest in probiotic prophylaxis in patients receiving antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Hickson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickson 2007</LINK>). The efficacy of this intervention should be examined in a properly designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trial. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for CDAD. There is no evidence to support the use of probiotics alone in the treatment of CDAD. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A systematic review of antibiotic therapy for CDAD questions the efficacy of any established antibiotic therapy for CDAD as the appropriate placebo controlled trials have not been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>). The same is true for probiotics. Studies in which probiotic preparations are used without antibiotic therapy would be of interest, since concomitant antibiotic therapy may effect the bioavailability of probiotics. The quality issues outlined in this review should be addressed in any future randomized controlled trials. </P>
