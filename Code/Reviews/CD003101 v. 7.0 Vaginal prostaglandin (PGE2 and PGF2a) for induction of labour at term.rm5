<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-14 11:47:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Induction of labour is offered to pregnant women when it is thought the outcome will be better for the mother and/or baby if the baby is born than if the pregnancy continues. Common reasons include prolonged pregnancy, prelabour rupture of the membranes, concerns about the health of the mother such as pre-eclampsia or the baby such as poor growth. Prostaglandins are hormones, produced throughout the body and can be used to start (induce) labour. They are applied locally to the vagina as tablets, gels, suppositories and pessaries to reduce side-effects. The dose, number of doses, and time between doses vary considerably. Sustained release pessaries reduce the need for repeat doses and so the number of vaginal examinations.</P>
<P>This review set out to determine the effectiveness and safety of vaginal prostaglandins for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour (the cervix softens, shortens and opens, the uterus starts to contract regularly). Eight different comparisons were made, different vaginal prostaglandins were compared with placebos or no treatment, or other vaginal prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2a, except misoprostol) and different preparations and dosages were compared. We identified 70 studies<B> </B>involving a total of 11,487 women. Vaginal prostaglandins increase the likelihood of vaginal birth within 24 hours, but they can also stimulate the uterus to contract too much and this may cause the baby's heart to slow, however they did not increase the caesarean section rate and may reduce it. Overall, the trials do not show any effect (improvement or worsening) of many important outcomes. Prostaglandin E2 tablets, gels, or pessaries including sustained release preparations appear to be as good as each other or the differences between them are small and have not yet been detected in the trials. Lower-dose regimens, as defined in the review, appeared to be as good as higher-dose regimens (eight trials, 1615 women).</P>
<P>Very limited data were available in the included trials on time in labour and patient satisfaction. Few studies have addressed issues relating to the safety of using vaginal prostaglandins for induction of labour as outpatients.</P>

<P>Prostaglandins have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. This is one of a series of reviews evaluating methods of induction of labour. This review focuses on prostaglandins given per vaginam, evaluating these in comparison with placebo (or expectant management) and with each other; prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a); different formulations (gels, tablets, pessaries) and doses.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 16:00:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included. In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains.</P>
<P>Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women). The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women). The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain.</P>
<P>PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-14 11:46:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Prostaglandins PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates. They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates. PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-14 11:47:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Induction of labour is a common intervention in pregnancy, it is undertaken when it is thought that the outcome of the pregnancy will be better for the mother and/or her baby if the baby is born. Approximately one in four or five women in the UK, Europe and USA are induced. Common reasons include prolonged pregnancy, prelabour rupture of the membranes, concerns about fetal well being (for example, poor growth, twin pregnancy) and maternal medical conditions (for example, diabetes, or pre-eclampsia).The evidence that induction is beneficial in specific clinical situations is not part of this review but is considered in other Cohrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physiological processes surrounding the initiation and promotion of labour are complex. During normal pregnancy the uterus is relaxed and the cervix long, firm and closed. In preparation for labour the cervix "ripens" becoming softer, shorter (effaced) and more open, the uterine smooth muscle begins to respond to stimuli that cause the waves of contractions leading up to and during labour. A variety of physical and pharmacological interventions are or have been used to induce labour. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods for induction of labour that use a standardised published &#8217;generic&#8217; protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). These reviews were initially developed to help inform the recommendations of the NICE clinical practice guidelines on Induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-14 11:47:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Prostaglandins are hormones, produced throughout the body from arachidonic acid via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. Their role in cervical ripening and induction of labour was discovered in the 1960s. They have a variety of effects at different sites and receptors in the body that lead to unwanted side-effects when used. The use of vaginal preparations (rather than oral or intravenous routes) for induction of labour aims to lessen side-effects. There are a number of different vaginal preparations of prostaglandins used, including gels, tablets, suppositories and pessaries. The induction regimens used vary in the dosage used, the number of applications and time intervals between repeat applications. Sustained release pessaries have been developed to reduce the number of applications (and vaginal examinations) needed during induction of labour.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-17 14:25:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Prostaglandins ripen the cervix and induce uterine contractions. They have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. Initial work focused on prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a - Dinoprost), but prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, Dinoprostone) is now the most commonly used agent. Prostaglandins are now available in a variety of formulations and may be given by mouth, intravenously, vaginally or intra cervically. Information on the effectiveness of other routes of administration and types of prostaglandin (such as misoprostol) are reviewed separately in the linked reviews. To avoid duplication, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 27. Each review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 27) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, this review includes comparison of vaginal prostaglandins to placebo or each other. Comparisons with interventions below it on the list are included in other reviews, for example (4) intravenous oxytocin will include only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>

<P>Dose comparisons of PGE2 into 'low-dose' and 'high-dose' categories are made to compare two common clinical practices. 'Low dose': where the maximum possible dose in one arm of the trial protocol was up to 3 mg PGE2. 'High dose': where the maximum possible dose in one arm of the trial protocol was 3 mg PGE2 or more. It was thought that this division would separate those trials using, on the whole, a single or repeated dose protocol. In addition, division at this level allows the largest number of trials to be included in the comparison. Trials comparing doses that both fall into either the high- or low-dose category were excluded.</P>

<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications:</P>
<P>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors);<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are infrequent and so composite outcomes have been used. This is not an ideal solution because some components of morbidity are clearly less severe than others and adverse events tend to cluster in individuals, so care is needed to count individuals rather than events. It is also possible for an intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity, however, in the context of labour induction at term, this is unlikely. All of these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components where available will be explored as secondary outcomes (see below).</P>

<P>For this review (and other linked induction of labour (IOL) methods reviews), the initial data extraction in 2000 was conducted and co-ordinated by (Josephine Kavanagh (JK),Tony Kelly (TK) Jane Thomas (JT)) at the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews. For updates, the data extraction has been undertaken by authors of the individual review, for this update it was undertaken by JT and Anna Fairclough (AF).</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified.

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<P>Selective reporting bias was not assessed in the previous versions of this review. Time from induction to delivery is an important outcome. It is reported in numerous ways in different studies. The choice of endpoint and choice of summary measurement used is a potential source of bias. In this update seven randomised controlled trials have been added. The trials are mainly small single-centre studies, from a variety of countries. Two trials reported information about trial registration (<LINK REF="STD-Taher-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taher 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triglia-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Triglia 2010</LINK>); for the other trials it has not been possible to establish changes and selective reporting of positive findings between protocol and publication.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen trials included some measurement of time from induction to delivery as an outcome but in only two trials (384 women) (<LINK REF="STD-Egarter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Egarter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulmsten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmsten 1985</LINK>) is 'Vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours' reported in a suitable format to contribute data to this review. Of the trials reporting time from induction to delivery in a format that is not useable in the meta-analysis, the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>) (2522 women) compared PGE2 gel with expectant management for women with ruptured membranes (ROM). The authors reported a reduction in the median time from ROM to delivery in the group given PGE2 compared to those in an expectant management. Of the two studies contributing data to this outcome, the larger study by <LINK REF="STD-Egarter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Egarter 1989</LINK> (345 women), included both primiparae and multiparae, all with a favourable cervix (Bishop score (BS) &gt; 4), intact membranes and the study used a higher dose of PGE2 (3 mg tablet). They found more women delivered within 24 hours with vaginal PGE2 compared with expectant management (up to 42 weeks' gestation) (12% of the PGE2 group versus 100% expectant management group were undelivered after 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.18). The smaller trial by Ulmsten (39 women) included only primiparae with an unfavourable cervix and used a single dose of 2 mg PGE2 suppository compared with a placebo. In this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ulmsten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmsten 1985</LINK>), 79% of the PGE2 group and 90% of the placebo group were undelivered after 24 hours (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.15). Although both trials' findings are compatible with an increase in vaginal delivery within 24 hours, differences between the interventions used, comparisons groups and characteristics of the participants contribute to the marked heterogeneity observed when the results are combined (I² = 98%). Given the heterogeneity, it is reasonable not to combine these results in meta-analysis, but if combined, a random-effects model should be used; the CIs are wider and the difference does not reach statistical significance, (18.1% versus 98.9%, average RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.83, (heterogeneity: Tau² = 3.77; Chi² = 125.43, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001); I² = 98%), two trials, 384 women, (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 43.14, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001), I² = 97.7%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Overall therefore, although not certain, it is likely that vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours.</P>
<P>'Uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes' was reported in 15 studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). An increase in uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes is seen in association with vaginal PGE2 (4.8% versus 1.0%, RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women) in comparison with placebo. This RR is reduced compared to previous versions of this review (which was 4.4% versus 0.5%, RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.93 to 8.90), because of a small decrease in event rate in the PGE2 group and an increase event rate in the control group. Uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes did not occur in either arms of four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chua-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chua 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dommisse-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Dommisse 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawai-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sawai 1991</LINK>) and is influenced by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rayburn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rayburn 1992</LINK>) where the estimate is a 30-fold increase in hyperstimulation rates associated with FHR changes (based on 13 events in the PGE2 group and zero in the control group, 12.9% versus 0.0%, RR 30.44, 95% CI 1.83 to 505.65). The new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bezircioglu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bezircioglu 2012</LINK>) had a higher event rate in both arms of the trial. The estimated rates of hyperstimulation with FHR changes seen in either the once only or repeated dose subgroups compared with placebo or no treatment are compatible with no difference between the groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The caesarean section rate is lower in the PGE2 groups compared with placebo/expectant management, the estimates are compatible with no difference or a reduction of 10% or more in caesarean section (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This finding is mirrored when the data were considered by parity, membrane status or cervical favourability. There was no statistical heterogeneity, and the results were similar when only higher quality studies were considered.</P>
<P>Serious neonatal (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) or maternal morbidity or death (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) are rare events and there are insufficient data to make conclusions about the impact of PGE2 on this outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The risk of the cervix remaining unchanged/unfavourable after 12 to 24 hours is reduced with the use of vaginal prostaglandins when compared with placebo (18.9% versus 40.5%, average RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.65, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.16; Chi² = 11.68, df = 5 (P = 0.04); I² = 57%, six trials, 567 women), test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 5.42, df = 2 (P = 0.07), I² = 63.1% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of oxytocin augmentation may be reduced if vaginal prostaglandins are used (39.0% versus 47.8%, average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.05, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.15; Chi² = 55.20, df = 12 (P &lt; 0.00001); I² = 78%, 13 trials, 1421 women), test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 7.31, df = 2 (P = 0.03), I² = 72.6% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Within the clinical subgroups, the reduction in the use of oxytocin augmentation is apparent in women with an unfavourable cervix (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.10, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.20; Chi² = 27.80, df = 7 (P = 0.0002); I² = 75%. eight trials, 813 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.7</LINK>); where repeated doses or sustained release preparations have been used, in women with a favourable cervix, no reduction is evident (43.7% versus 42.5%, average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.09; Chi² = 7.96, df = 2 (P = 0.02); I² = 75%, three trials, 443 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, hyperstimulation without FHR changes is increased with PGE2 (1.4% versus 0.4%, RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.26, 13 trials, 3636 women), this effect is greatest in the sustained release subgroup (6.6% versus 0.0%, RR 7.85, 95% CI 1.05 to 58.82) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>), (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.20, df = 2 (P = 0.33), I² = 9.0%).</P>
<P>There was no increase in the use of epidural anaesthesia when prostaglandins were used (49.6% versus 45.5%, average RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.15; Chi² = 50.62, df = 6 (P &lt; 0.000001), I² = 88%, seven trials, 3555 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Shoaib-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shoaib 1994</LINK>) reported a five-fold increase in epidural rates. The trial compared active and conservative management for ruptured membranes at term. No difference was seen in this study between caesarean section rates or the need for instrumental delivery but the results on epidural use of this study contrast sharply with the other trials. When excluded from the analysis, there is no difference detected between the groups, (48% versus 47%, average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; Chi² = 6.85, df = 5 (P = 0.23); I² = 27%). This study also impacts in the analysis of the clinical subgroup of women with ruptured membranes (<LINK REF="CMP-005.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.5</LINK>), again when removed the heterogeneity is reduced.</P>
<P>There was no evidence on an effect of instrumental vaginal delivery. Meconium-stained liquor was less likely if induction was undertaken with vaginal prostaglandins (8.5% versus 10.5%, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, 12 trials, 4245 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (2.2% versus 1.7%, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.92, 16 trials, 4481 women), (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 8.05, df = 2 (P = 0.02), I² = 75.2%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (8.8% versus 9.4%, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14, 12 trials, 4022 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). Apgar score less than seven at five minutes was not a common event and only 88 cases were reported in the 4481 patients, so the trials may be too small to detect a difference if one exists.</P>
<P>Maternal side-effects were not increased with the use of vaginal prostaglandins. The rate of postpartum haemorrhage was increased with the use of prostaglandins (4.1% versus 2.8%, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.09, nine trials, 3537 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>), the majority of this result is as a result of the increase seen in one study that compared active versus conservative management of ruptured membranes (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies looked at maternal satisfaction with mode of induction (<LINK REF="STD-Cardozo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cardozo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>). In both trials a policy of active induction was compared with expectant management, but the indications for induction were different. In the Cardozo trial, women at 40 + 10 days gestation were offered induction within two to four days or expectant management until labour started spontaneously or monitoring raised concern about either fetal or maternal well being; this could be many days or weeks. Allocation was based on odd or even last digit of hospital number, mothers who did not like their assigned group could request the alternative treatment group. The Hannah trial included women with prelabour rupture of the membranes, expectant management lasted a maximum of four days. The results of the two trials are different, but the larger trial, which is a better quality study with 2520 women (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>), has fewer women who are unsatisfied in the PGE2 group. Overall, women were less satisfied with a policy of expectant management (6.4% versus 11.5%, average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.40, heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.64; Chi² = 14.99, df = 1 (P = 0.0001); I² = 93%, test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 14.97, df = 1 (P = 0.0001), I² = 93.3%, two trials, 2922 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to draw any meaningful conclusions for the remaining outcomes (uterine rupture, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood, perinatal death, postpartum haemorrhage, serious maternal complications or caregiver not satisfied).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Vaginal prostaglandin F2a versus placebo (four trials, 435 women)</HEADING>
<P>Three trials included length of labour as an outcome but vaginal delivery not achieved in 24 hours was not reported in a useable format.

Caesarean section rates in the trials are lower than are currently found in many countries.

The <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK> study may differ from others within the group in that they used oxytocin augmentation at 12 hours after the onset of the induction process in both groups. There is also an imbalance in gestational age between the two groups which may have arisen by chance or may reflect bias in the study's methodology. The sustained release insert group has a higher gestational age which may allow potentially for a more straightforward induction process, hence explaining the greater reduction in the use of oxytocin for augmentation in the insert group.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">PGE2 versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Prostaglandins are probably effective at inducing labour: they probably increase the likelihood of delivery within 24 hours (although this does not reach statistical significance in the meta-analysis), they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes, have no effect or may reduce the risk of caesarean section, but there is an absence of evidence on the overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures). The reporting of maternal and fetal morbidity is very limited. Induction of labour is a common procedure so even small differences in effects could be important.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vehicle comparisons</HEADING>
<P>It is not possible to detect a difference in the effectiveness between the gel or tablet forms of PGE2 or between the sustained release pessaries and PGE2 gel/tablets. This is not that surprising as differences between different formulations of the same drug are likely to be small and so the trials in this review may be underpowered to detect such differences if they exist. However, because induction of labour is a frequently used intervention, even small differences could be important.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose comparisons</HEADING>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-14 14:03:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There are numerous trials examining the efficacy of various vaginal prostaglandin (E2) preparations. However, data on the effect of these on important outcomes are limited. There is a particular paucity of comparable data on time in labour/to delivery, and evidence of maternal and neonatal benefits and harms. The evidence is relevant to current clinical practice, and to the one in five pregnant women who undergo induction of labour, because vaginal prostaglandins are the main induction methods recommended in clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to quantify the impact of inadequate or unclear randomisation and/or concealment within the review. The effect of including only those trials with adequate methodology was highlighted in the results. Lower-quality factors appeared to be responsible for significant heterogeneity in two main areas of the review (caesarean section rates and oxytocin augmentation regarding PGE2 versus placebo), but in neither case was the overall result altered.</P>
<P>Due to the number of agent comparisons in this review and the small number of trials in each group, a more detailed analysis of the impact of trial quality on the results in the other sections of the review could not be undertaken.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to examine the effect of possible publication bias in this review and its impact on the five primary outcomes. Due to the restriction in data on vaginal delivery rates not achieved in 24 hours and the small amount of data available on serious maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, the calculations have been restricted to hyperstimulation rates with fetal heart rate changes and caesarean section. Examination of a standard funnel plot reveals no graphical evidence of publication bias within this review for the two examined outcomes, although the plot does become asymmetrical when only studies of adequate quality are included when examining caesarean section.</P>
<P>Further analysis of publication bias on secondary outcomes was limited to comparisons where more than 10 trials were present. There was evidence of asymmetry within the plot for Apgar score less than seven at five minutes when comparing PGE2 to placebo (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). However, there was no evidence of similar asymmetry seen for other similar neonatal outcomes.</P>

<P>The review includes a measurement of time to delivery (percentage not delivered in 24 hours), although most studies included time to delivery as an outcome, the data are not provided in a way that is usable in this review. The review has five primary outcomes and up to 26 secondary outcomes have been included, so by chance alone we should have at least one significant finding.</P>

Four of these linked reviews compare prostaglandins (PGE2/PGF2a) given by alternate routes (intracervical PG (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2008</LINK>), extra-amniotic PG (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2001</LINK>), intravenous PG (<LINK REF="REF-Luckas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luckas 2000</LINK>), oral PG (<LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>)) and a further three evaluate misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue (vaginal misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK>), oral misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2014</LINK>), buccal or sublingual misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Muzonzini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muzonzini 2004</LINK>)). Overall, these agents seem to be effective at inducing labour, vaginal delivery within 24 hours is more likely when they are used. In contrast to this review's conclusions, women in trials comparing intracervical PGE2 with placebo were significantly more likely to deliver within 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2008</LINK>), and when intracervical and vaginal PGE2 are compared, the findings favour vaginal PGE2. The other reviews include other commonly used interventions that are often used in conjunction with prostaglandins for induction of labour (such as intravenous oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2009</LINK>), amniotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2000</LINK>), oxytocin and amniotomy combined (<LINK REF="REF-Howarth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howarth 2001</LINK>)).</P>
<P>Two reviews evaluate induction of labour setting - comparing methods of induction of labour in an outpatient setting. <LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2010</LINK> includes five trials, also included in this review, but the outcomes considered important differ between the reviews; where the same outcome is considered the findings are consistent. The studies included in outpatient versus inpatient induction (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2013a</LINK>) and morning versus evening induction (<LINK REF="REF-Bakker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakker 2013</LINK>) do not overlap with studies in this review because the method of induction is consistent between the groups, but the setting/timing is varied.</P>
<P>Of the 13 reviews on specific indications for induction of labour, reviews comparing induction of labour with expectant management beyond 40 weeks and with ruptured membranes potentially overlap with this review although the outcomes assessed may differ (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jozwiak-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jozwiak 2012a</LINK> considers methods of induction of labour for women who have had a previous caesarean section, currently none of trials included in that review are eligible for this review, but there is potential for overlap.</P>
<P>Finally searching PROSPERO and Pubmed for reviews including induction of labour using vaginal prostaglandins identified two further non-Cochrane systematic reviews. A review of reviews on methods of induction of labour by <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2011</LINK> summarises the findings of the 27 linked Cochrane reviews and as such, for vaginal prostaglandins its findings are based on the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Facchinetti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Facchinetti 2012</LINK> compares sustained release vaginal PGE2 with repeat PGE2 (both vaginal or intracervical), specifically in a subgroup of women having their first baby, with an unfavourable cervix (Bishop score (BS) &lt; 5) and with intact membranes. Their primary outcome is caesarean section, and although 18 trials are identified, 11 of these are excluded (reasons given included results not stratified into multips/primips, BS &gt; 4, rupture of membranes). In the current version of this review, 13 trials are included in the comparison sustained release vaginal PGE2 versus vaginal PGE2 gel or tablet, 11 of these report caesarean section as an outcome and overall, no difference is detected (<LINK REF="CMP-026.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 26.3</LINK>). Eight trials specify women with an unfavourable cervix and again no difference was detected (<LINK REF="CMP-029.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 29.3</LINK>). If only primips with an unfavourable cervix (five trials) were included, again no difference is found (analysis done but not included for this update as not a prespecified subgroup) and finally the subgroup of women having their first baby, who have an unfavourable cervix and intact membranes, no difference is detected (four trials included) (analysis not included here as not a prespecified subgroup). The same four studies are included in the <LINK REF="REF-Facchinetti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Facchinetti 2012</LINK> review, but two studies using intracervical PGE2 are also included in the meta-analysis. These trials were not eligible for this review and were excluded from <LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2008</LINK> review, both favour sustained release preparations and give 40% of the weight to the result, which is in favour of SR pessaries. <LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2008</LINK> identified 29 trials comparing intracervical PGE2 versus vaginal PGE2 (not stratified into gel, tablet, sustained release), so there would appear to be 42 potentially eligible trials, yet Franchetti identified only 18 studies; this is a potential source of bias. In addition, the inclusion/exclusion criteria are not consistently expressed. The review acknowledges sponsorship by Ferring (makers of a sustained release preparation).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-14 14:05:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Vaginal prostaglandin E2 is probably an effective induction agent, although many trials report a reduction in time to delivery with prostaglandins, in most trials this is not in a useable format and so the likelihood of vaginal birth within 24 hours does not reach statistical significance in the meta-analysis. Prostaglandins increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes but do not effect reducing the rate of caesarean section. The overall effect on maternal and neonatal health is not certain.<BR/>
<BR/>Prostaglandin E2 formulations (either as a gel, tablet or sustained release pessary) should be recommended as effective induction agents. No difference in important maternal and fetal outcomes was detected but there may be marginal differences between preparations (increasing rate of cervical change and operative vaginal delivery). These may be important because induction is a common procedure.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-14 14:06:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<UL>
<LI>One of the main limitations of this review was the varied manner in which many of the outcomes were reported. Time from induction to a delivery was measured but not in a format that was useable in this review. Consideration of using other methods to capture this information are needed.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Induction is a common procedure, the differences between different formulations are probably small but these marginal differences could have a big impact on the health of women and babies, of their experience and the costs of health care.</LI>

<BR/>The trials included in the primary reviews were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (see above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with The Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous reviewers in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials, i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels was sought.</P>
<P>Predefined subgroup analyses are: previous caesarean section or not; nulliparity or multiparity; membranes intact or ruptured, and cervix unfavourable, favourable or undefined. Only those outcomes with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they meet the prestated criteria in <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>. Included trial data were processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention to treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis is performed if possible). Where data were missing, clarification was sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data were excluded from the analysis. This decision rested with the reviewers of primary reviews and is clearly documented. If missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting was poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual reviewers for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

<P>In 2008, the methods and software for carrying out reviews were updated, as a result of which new reviews and updates, where appropriate, will use these new methods (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>), which will be described in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section of all the individual new and updated reviews.For this update, we used the following methods when assessing the trials identified by the updated search.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We described methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence for each trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation, consecutively-numbered, sealed opaque envelopes;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;</LI>
<LI>inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random-number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, for example, withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow up using the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;</LI>
<LI>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;</LI>
<LI>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;</LI>
<LI>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. If heterogeneity was found, we explored this by sensitivity analysis, followed by random-effects if required.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we used the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. Where there was evidence of skewness, this has been reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We analysed data on all participants with available data in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If, in the original reports, participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised and there is sufficient information in the trial report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We applied tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² statistic. If we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and performed sensitivity analysis. We used a random-effects meta-analysis as an overall summary if this was considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We conducted planned subgroup analyses as performed for the other reviews in this series (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>). When assessing differences between subgroups, e.g. within the comparison of vaginal PGE2 versus placebo, we explored this using an inverse variance method of meta-
analysis and presenting the statistics for subgroup differences using chi² and I² statistics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, by excluding studies with clearly inadequate allocation of concealment.</P>
