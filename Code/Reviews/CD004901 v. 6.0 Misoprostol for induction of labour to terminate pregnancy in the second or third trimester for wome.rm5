Vaginal misoprostol is associated with a reduction in the occurrence of maternal gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea when compared with other prostaglandin preparations.

However, important information regarding maternal safety, and in particular the occurrence of rare outcomes such as uterine rupture, remains limited.

This situation is psychologically stressful for the woman, her partner and family, and for the health professionals caring for her.</P><P>When a baby dies before birth, the options for care are either to wait for labour to start spontaneously or to induce labour. Most women (over 90%) begin to contract and labour within three weeks of their baby dying, but if labour does not begin, there is a risk of developing a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1999</LINK>). This complication develops when various factors in the blood which usually stop a person from bleeding (clotting factors) are used faster than they can be replaced. This increases the risk of severe bleeding complications or haemorrhage.</P><P>A disadvantage of a long interval between fetal death and birth relates to the degree of information that can be obtained from a postmortem examination or autopsy of the baby. Where there has been a considerable delay between the death of the baby and birth, the tissue may begin to break down, limiting the amount of information that can be obtained about the cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1999</LINK>). This may have implications for counselling about the risks for any future pregnancy.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-29 11:04:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Inducing labour may involve the use of the hormone oxytocin which causes the uterus to contract (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2001</LINK>). When labour is induced early in pregnancy, this has been associated with long and painful labours, as the uterus is less sensitive to oxytocin before term (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1999</LINK>). Prostaglandins have been used to induce labour and are particularly useful where a woman's cervix is unfavourable or not ready to commence labour (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 1999</LINK>). Prostaglandins have been administered orally (<LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>), vaginally (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2003</LINK>), into the cervix (intracervical), outside the amniotic sac (extra-amniotically) (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2001</LINK>), or intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Luckas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luckas 2000</LINK>). There are also mechanical devices which have been developed to dilate or open the cervix (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2001</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-12 09:02:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin that is structurally related to prostaglandin E<SUB>1</SUB> (PGE<SUB>1</SUB>). Misoprostol is licensed for use as an anti-ulcer medication in the treatment of gastric ulcer disease and does not have a product license for use in pregnancy anywhere in the world. Despite this, the use of misoprostol in obstetric and gynaecological practice has increased, being used widely in the management of first and second trimester abortion (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 1998</LINK>), and in the third trimester of pregnancy following intrauterine fetal death (<LINK REF="REF-Mariani_x002d_Neto-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariani-Neto 1987</LINK>). More recently, misoprostol has been used in the induction of labour at term in the presence of a viable fetus, with both vaginal (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>) and oral (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>) routes of administration being used. Misoprostol has been investigated for use in the third stage of labour to prevent postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2007</LINK>). Potential advantages to the use of misoprostol over other prostaglandin preparations include its stability at room temperature (other prostaglandins need to be stored in the refrigerator) and low cost. This has important implications for women in low-resource countries.</P><P>The Cochrane reviews assessing misoprostol for the induction of labour at term in the presence of a live fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>) concluded that there was considerable variation in both the dose and frequency of misoprostol administered to induce labour, and that at present the optimal dosing regimen is uncertain. There have been calls to further investigate the lowest effective dose of misoprostol, thereby minimising side effects and maximising safety for both the woman and her infant (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-03-12 08:43:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The issues related to the use of low doses of misoprostol are a little different for women who are having labour induced to terminate their pregnancy because of fetal anomalies or after intrauterine fetal death. While side effects (including uterine hyperstimulation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea) and safety (particularly rare complications such as uterine rupture) are important considerations for the woman, issues related to fetal wellbeing are not. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the receptivity of the uterus to prostaglandin medication, especially at early gestational ages, where the use of low doses of misoprostol may be ineffective in inducing labour, or be associated with a long induction to delivery interval. Sensitivity of the uterus to medication may also be influenced by whether or not the fetus is alive at the time of induction.</P><P>The aim of this review is to assess the benefits and harms of misoprostol to induce labour after the death in utero of a fetus, or for fetal anomalies in the second or third trimester of pregnancy when compared with other methods of induction of labour.</P><P>Clinical trials of medical treatment, including misoprostol, for fetal deaths before 24 weeks are considered in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2006</LINK>).</P><P>In addition, there is a published Cochrane protocol planning to review trials of medical treatments, including misoprostol, for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Medema-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medema 2005</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-03-12 08:43:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To compare, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of misoprostol to induce labour to terminate pregnancy in the second and third trimester for women with a fetal anomaly or after intrauterine fetal death when compared with other methods of induction of labour.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2010-03-12 10:54:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-12 08:43:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-03-12 08:43:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials comparing misoprostol (either oral or vaginal administration) with placebo or no treatment, or any other method of induction of labour (including prostaglandins administered orally, vaginally, intracervically, extra-amniotically; oxytocin; misoprostol (oral or vaginal); mifepristone; or mechanical methods of induction including extra-amniotic Foley catheter or laminaria).</P><P>We excluded quasi-randomised trials (e.g. those randomised by date of birth or hospital number).

This systematic review includes the available randomised controlled trials comparing the use of misoprostol in second and third trimester of pregnancy with other methods of labour induction to terminate pregnancy. Overall, the quality of the trials available for inclusion was reasonable, although there was considerable variation in the outcomes reported, and in the regimen of misoprostol adopted.</P><P>When compared with agents that have traditionally been used to induce labour in this setting (for example, gemeprost, prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> and prostaglandin F<SUB>2alpha</SUB>), vaginal misoprostol is as effective in effecting vaginal birth within 24 hours, with a similar induction to birth interval. When compared with other prostaglandin preparations, the occurrence of maternal gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea is reduced with the use of vaginal misoprostol. While the different treatments involving various prostaglandin preparations appear comparable for the reported outcomes, the information available regarding rare maternal complications, such as uterine rupture, is limited.</P><P>The use of oral misoprostol for induction of labour for termination in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy for fetal anomaly or following intra-uterine fetal demise, is less effective than vaginal misoprostol, with women experiencing a longer induction to birth interval, and an increased chance of remaining undelivered 24 hours after the induction process commences. The more limited information available about the use of sublingual misoprostol in this setting would suggest that it is more effective than both oral or vaginal administration. Information about women's preferences for an oral induction method in this clinical setting is limited, with suggestions that satisfaction with the induction process is more related to the duration of the induction rather than the route of administration of medication (<LINK REF="STD-Akoury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Akoury 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2005</LINK>).</P><P>The Cochrane systematic reviews of the use of oral (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>) and vaginal (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>) misoprostol for induction of labour at term in the presence of a live fetus identified significant variation in both the dose and frequency of drug administration, concluding that at present, the optimal regimen for misoprostol is uncertain. Similarly, there is wide variation in the dose, frequency of administration and route of administration of misoprostol to effect termination of pregnancy in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. There have been calls for further investigation of the lowest effective dose of misoprostol to induce labour at term in the presence of a live fetus, to ensure minimal side effects for the woman, and maintain safety for both the woman and fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>). These efforts have been somewhat hampered by the preparation of misoprostol as a 100 mcg or 200 mcg tablet. Concerns about fetal safety and avoidance of toxicity are not relevant in the situation of induction of labour following fetal death or to effect termination of pregnancy in the second and third trimester. However, issues of side effects and safety for the woman remain. While this meta-analysis indicates a low occurrence of medication side effects with the use of misoprostol, not all trials provided this information. There are insufficient data to assess the occurrence of rare but potentially life threatening complications for the woman, including uterine rupture, with not all trials reporting serious adverse outcomes, and at present a combined sample size underpowered to be able to detect all but large differences.</P><P>The use of low doses of misoprostol must take into account the receptivity of the uterus to prostaglandin agents, particularly at early gestational ages. The use of lower doses of misoprostol was associated with an increased chance of a woman not achieving vaginal birth within 24 hours, and a longer induction to birth interval, when compared with higher doses of misoprostol. In this situation, low dose medication may be ineffective in inducing labour or result in an unacceptably long induction to delivery interval. However, the increased dose of misoprostol to effect termination must be balanced against an increase in the occurrence of maternal gastrointestinal side effects. The effect of increasing the dose of misoprostol on the occurrence of rare but potentially life threatening maternal complications remains uncertain.</P><P>Future research efforts should be directed towards determining the optimal dose and frequency of administration, with particular attention to standardised reporting of all relevant outcomes and assessment of rare adverse events. Further information is required about the use of sublingual misoprostol in this clinical setting.</P></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-16 01:27:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-09-16 01:27:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The use of vaginal misoprostol in the termination of second and third trimester of pregnancy is as effective as other prostaglandin preparations (including cervagem, prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> and prostaglandin F<SUB>2alpha</SUB>), and more effective than oral administration of misoprostol.
