<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-11 13:07:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders which frequently occur in childhood and adolescence. Increasing recognition of the early onset of anxiety disorders and of the effectiveness of medication in treating adult anxiety disorders has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medication in treating paediatric patients. This systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents identified 22 short-term (&lt;= 16 weeks) randomised controlled trials which were eligible for inclusion (2519 participants). Treatment response was significantly greater after treatment with medication (58.1%) than with placebo (31.5%) in 14 trials. Medication was more effective than placebo in reducing overall symptom severity across all of the anxiety disorders (number of studies (N) = 9). The greatest number of trials were for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), for which treatment efficacy in reducing symptom severity was also observed . The greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have used the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). No controlled evidence could be found for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines, despite their continued prescription for paediatric anxiety disorders. Medication was less well tolerated than placebo, as indicated by the significant proportion of children and adolescents who dropped out due to adverse effects during the short term trials. Furthermore, while few incidences of suicidal behaviour/ideation in the included trials were attributed to study medication, it is important to be aware of the need for careful monitoring after initiation of SSRIs in treating this population. In conclusion, medication should be considered as part of the treatment of paediatric anxiety disorders over the short-term. Additional research into the optimal dose and duration of medication treatment, as well as the effects of age on the efficacy and tolerability of medication is warranted.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 14:41:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan C Ipser">
<P>Childhood/adolescent anxiety disorders include both those traditionally associated with childhood (separation anxiety disorder and the DSM-III (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) diagnoses of overanxious disorder and avoidant disorder of childhood) and those traditionally seen as adult disorders (panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia, specific phobia (SP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic and acute stress disorders). These disorders have increasingly been recognised as frequently having their onset during childhood or adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2007</LINK>). Prevalence in the paediatric community has been reported as lying between 4% and 7% when assessed using DSM-IV criteria (adjusted for impairment), with the cumulative incidence of anxiety disorders as high as 10% by 16 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Canino-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canino 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence tend to be chronic if left untreated, and are potentially disabling (<LINK REF="REF-Keller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Woodward-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodward 2001</LINK>). Research has shown that the long term outcome of young people with anxiety disorders is poorer in terms of physical and mental health, quality of life and achievement than that of children without such disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Woodward-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodward 2001</LINK>). Early onset of these disorders may impair social and personal developmental processes, thereby contributing towards the finding that adults with anxiety disorders have poorer subjective views of their physical and mental health, social relationships, occupation, and home and family life (<LINK REF="REF-Olatunji-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olatunji 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 06:45:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Effective management of early onset anxiety disorders may improve outcome, thus it is important that guidelines for treatment be available. </P>
<P>Traditional approaches to anxiety disorders in childhood were predominantly psychological. Few controlled studies assessing the efficacy of such treatment modalities are available (<LINK REF="REF-Target-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Target 1994</LINK>), but studies of cognitive-behavioural strategies in adolescent anxiety disorders are encouraging (<LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flannery-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flannery 2000</LINK>). The results of a Cochrane review of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for paediatric anxiety disorders (<LINK REF="REF-James-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2005</LINK>), as well as behavioural therapy and CBT for OCD in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Kearney 2006</LINK>) also emphasise a role for this treatment modality. Nevertheless, the increasing elucidation of the biological substrate of anxiety disorders and the discovery of effective pharmacological treatments for adults argues for investigating the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for paediatric anxiety disorders.</P>
<P>Reports of the use of pharmacotherapy in childhood anxiety disorders began to appear in the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amato-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amato 1962</LINK>). With the growing tendency to use psychotropic medications in younger patients (<LINK REF="REF-Olfson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olfson 2002</LINK>), it seems imperative that the efficacy of such strategies be evaluated. For instance, a review of medical claims in the US discovered a 2 to 3- fold increase in the use of psychotropic agents amongst children and adolescents<B> </B>between 1987 and 1996, with antidepressants ranking as the second most utilized medication class (<LINK REF="REF-Zito-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zito 2003</LINK>). Neverthess, for many reasons, including failure to recognise the extent of mental health problems in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Sayal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sayal 2006</LINK>), and ethical problems surrounding the use of newly developed pharmacotherapeutic agents in this population group, child psychiatry has lagged behind in the development of biologically based treatments.</P>
<P>The perception of paediatric anxiety disorders as the initial manifestation of the same disorders found in adults (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkridge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkridge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2007</LINK>) is consistent with expert consensus that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should be regarded as first line agents in treating anxiety disorders in both children/adolescents and adults. Sertraline, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have all been approved by the FDA in treating paediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (<LINK REF="REF-Flament-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flament 2007</LINK>). The SSRIs have also been compared favourably to other medication agents in treating paediatric anxiety disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Biederman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biederman 2004</LINK>). They typically give rise to a smaller number of side effects, and a longer treatment effect than the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and do not possess the risk of dependency associated with the benzodiazepines. Nevertheless, the necessity of a systematic comparison of the risk/benefit profiles of the different medication classes in treating paediatric anxiety disorders is highlighted by concerns that the benefits of certain SSRIs in treating depression do not outweigh the risks associated with their use amongst patients under 18 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-05-11 13:08:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Particular problems have been associated in comparing the responses to different medications in the available studies in this area. From the time of the early studies of Gittelman-Klein et al (<LINK REF="STD-Gittelman_x002d_Klein-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Gittelman-Klein 1971</LINK>) to the large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of venlafaxine extended release in treating paediatric generalized anxiety disorder (<LINK REF="STD-March-2007" TYPE="STUDY">March 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rynn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rynn 2007</LINK>), nosology in child psychiatry has changed significantly, making comparisons of early and late trials difficult. This has been compounded by clinical and methodological variation between trials. Reviews have generally concluded that while there is evidence that some pharmacotherapeutic agents are effective in some paediatric onset anxiety disorders, there is a need for further large, rigorous controlled trials in many areas (e<B>.</B>g<B>., </B>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the trials included in this review was independently assessed by two raters, using the CCDAN Quality of Research Scale (CCDAN-QRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>). This 23 item scale assesses a range of features such as sample size, the duration of the intervention, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and whether or not the power of the trial to detect a treatment effect was calculated. Disagreements between raters which could not be resolved were referred to a third reviewer for discussion (DS). In addition, data for other trial characteristics which have been recognised as potential sources of bias, such as the method used in generating the allocation sequence, how allocation was concealed, whether outcome assessment was blinded, and the number of participants who where lost to follow up, were independently determined by two raters, as part of the data collation process. This is regarded as necessary given doubts concerning the usefulness of an overall quality score from a scale composed of multiple items (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2003</LINK>).</P>

The Risk of Bias tool covers a total of six domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias), and is now recommended for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Categorical data</HEADING>
<P>Relative risk (RR) of response to treatment was used as the summary statistic for the dichotomous outcome of interest (CGI-I). Relative risk ratios was used instead of odds ratios, as odd ratios are less easily interpreted. Odds ratios also tend to overestimate the size of the treatment effect when confused with relative risks. This is especially the case when the occurrence of the outcome of interest is common (as anticipated in this review, with an expected response greater than 20%) (Deeks 2008a).</P>
<P>The number needed to treat (NNT) was also calculated. The NNT is interpreted as the number of patients who require treatment before a single patient responds to medication, relative to a control. It was calculated using the risk ratio as per recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Pearson's chi-square tests were used to detect differences between the comparison groups in side effect prevalence<B> </B>(using the R statistical software (<LINK REF="REF-R-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">R 2005</LINK>)), regardless of whether the results of significance tests were reported.

<P>All analyses of dichotomous data were intention-to-treat (ITT). The total number of participants randomised to the different comparison groups were used as the denominator in comparisons of treatment response. Only data from trials which provide information on the original group size (prior to drop-outs) were included in the analyses of treatment response. In trial reports in which multiple forms of data imputation were conducted, preference was given to the inclusion of summary statistics for continuous outcome measures derived from mixed effects models (ME), followed by last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) summary statistics (in that order). This is in line with evidence that ME methods are more robust to bias than LOCF analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Verbeke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeke 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Heterogeneity of treatment response, that is whether the differences among the results of trials were greater than would be expected by chance alone, was assessed by means of the chi-squared<B> </B>test of heterogeneity. A significance level of less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity, given the low power of the chi-square statistic when the number of trials is small (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).

<P>Differences in treatment response between subgroups were assessed by means of Deeks' stratified test of heterogeneity (2001). This method subtracts the sum of the chi-squared statistics available for each of the subgroups in the study from the chi-statistic available for all the trials, to provide a measure (Q<SUB>b</SUB>) of heterogeneity between subgroups. Differences in treatment response on the CGI-I was determined by whether the confidence intervals for the effect sizes of the subgroups overlap. This method was chosen in preference to the stratified test, due to inaccuracies in the calculation in RevMan of the chi-square statistic for dichotomous measures (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>A priori subgroup analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1994</LINK>) were undertaken in order to assess the degree to which clinical and methodological differences between trials systematically influence differences observed in the primary treatment outcomes.</P>
<P>The trials were grouped according to the following potential<B> </B>methodological sources of heterogeneity:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the involvement of participants from a single centre or multiple centres. Single centre trials are more likely to be associated with lower sample size but less variability in clinician ratings.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>whether or not trials were industry funded. In general, published trials which are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies appear more likely to report positive findings than trials which are not supported by for-profit companies (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following clinical sources of heterogeneity between trials were also assessed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the presence or absence of major depression. This will assist in determining the extent to which the efficacy of a medication agent in treating paediatric anxiety disorders is independent of its ability to reduce symptoms of depression, an important consideration given the classification of many of these medications as antidepressants.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>the age classification of participants. There is evidence that age-related differences in metabolism, and consequent differences in the rate at which medications are broken down in the body, may affect the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Simeon-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simeon 1989</LINK>). In RCTs which contain both children and adolescents (as defined in the trial reports) the outcomes for these 2 age bands will be calculated separately, to determine whether response to medication is affected by the onset of puberty.</LI>

<P>In recognition of the possibility of differential effects for different types of medication, all of the comparisons were stratified by medication class. Medications which could not be classified as either benzodiazepines, SSRIs, or TCAs were placed in a separate category, labelled "other medication". Post-hoc comparisons of treatment response and symptom severity were conducted for trials of OCD, as well as for a group of anxiety disorders comprising GAD, Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD), and SP. The decision to conduct these analyses was justified by the large number of controlled trials of pharmacotherapy for paediatric OCD, while GAD, SAD and SP are highly comorbid in children and adolescents and are often treated together in the intervention literature (<LINK REF="STD-Birmaher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birmaher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RUPPASG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">RUPPASG 2001</LINK>) .</P>

<P>Sensitivity analyses determine the robustness of the reviewer's conclusion to methodological assumptions made in conducting the meta-analysis. The planned comparison of the use of treatment response versus non-response as a summary statistic was not performed. Although this comparison is regarded as necessary given concerns that treatment response may result in less consistent summary statistics than non-response (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>), empirical evidence that this is a danger only extends to trials in which the control group event rate is high. As this was not the case for the majority of the trials included in this review, the reviewers decided that such an analysis was not necessary.</P>
<P>A "worst case/best case" analysis was conducted to determine the influence of the exclusion of participants who were lost to follow up (LTF) on the findings of treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). In the worst case, all the missing data<B> </B>for the treatment group were recorded as non-responders, whereas in the best case, all the missing data in the control group were treated as non-responders.

Almost twice as many patients responded to medication (58.1%) than to placebo (31.5%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using an assumed control risk of 0.364 (estimated from a recent meta-analysis of paediatric antidepressant treatment <LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK>) the number needed to treat is 4, indicating that four patients would have to be treated with medication for one additional treatment responder, relative to the control condition. We also calculated NNT assuming a control risk of 0.1 and 0.5. The NNT was 12 and 3 respectively.</P>
<P>Significant heterogeneity in treatment response on the CGI-I was observed across all trials (chi-squared = 27.33, p = 0.01, I-squared = 52%). This did not appear to be explained by differences between the individual SSRI agents or differences in efficacy between the SSRIs and the SNRI trials, as indicated by overlap in confidence intervals .</P>

<P>Medication was more effective than placebo in reducing overall symptom severity across all of the anxiety disorders (N = 9, SMD = -0.69, 95%CI = -0.94, -0.44, n = 810). In post-hoc comparisons, medication treatment resulted in a decrease of approximately 4.5 points on the CY-BOCS in OCD patients (N = 7, WMD<B> </B>= -4.45, 95%CI = -5.94, -2.97, n = 765). Statistically significant reductions in symptom severity after short-term treatment with SSRIs were also observed on a variety of scales for other anxiety disorders ( n = 428, SMD = -0.82, 95%CI = -1.3, -0.33, N=4).</P>

An average of 7.3% of participants who received SSRIs withdrew for this reason.

This data is stratified by anxiety disorder and agent, with information provided on the doses employed.</P>
<P>Regarding suicidality, one OCD patient had to discontinue treatment with fluoxetine following the emergence of suicidal thoughts (<LINK REF="STD-Riddle-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Riddle 1992</LINK>). Treatment with paroxetine over 10 to 16 weeks resulted in the emergence of suicidal ideation for some of the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2004</LINK>: n = 1, <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2004</LINK>: n = 4). Suicidal ideation was observed in four patients in an 8 week trial of venlafaxine (<LINK REF="STD-Rynn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rynn 2007</LINK>), and in three patients in a 16 week trial of the same agent (<LINK REF="STD-March-2007" TYPE="STUDY">March 2007</LINK>). The ideation was severe enough in Rynn (2007) to result in one patient withdrawing for this reason. No cases of completed suicide were reported for any of the RCTs.</P>
<P>Drug-related changes in behaviour associated with an "activation syndrome" have been hypothesised as increasing the likelihood of engaging in suicidal behaviours in paediatric populations (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2007</LINK>). Symptoms hypothesised as falling with the activation syndrome include irritability, agitation, panic attacks, restlessness, hostility, aggressivity, insomnia, disinhibition, emotional lability, impulsivity, restlessness, social withdrawal and odd behaviour. These symptoms were observed in some of the RCTs included in this review. Although the benzodiazepine clonazepam did not result in higher scores on the side effects rating scale in the one trial which tested this medication (<LINK REF="STD-Graae-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Graae 1994</LINK>), drowsiness, irritability and oppositional behaviour were described as the most frequent side effects observed in treating a variety of anxiety disorders. Two children dropped out of this trial due to serious disinhibition with marked irritability, tantrums and aggressivity. Approximately 17% of 133 GAD, SP and SAD patients treated with sertraline for 12 weeks exhibited activation symptoms. Of the 11 participants who dropped out as a result of an adverse response to medication or placebo in this trial, four experienced behavioural adverse effects (three for agitation or disinhibition and one for hyperactivity) (<LINK REF="STD-Walkup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Walkup 2008</LINK>). Five youths (7%) had to be discontinued from a 12 week fixed-dose trial of fluoxetine due to excitement, giddiness or disinhibition (<LINK REF="STD-Birmaher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birmaher 2003</LINK>). Behaviours regarded as changed/abnormal were reported for 2% of youth (6 of 293) receiving venlafaxine ER, with one patient manifesting time-limited hypomania (<LINK REF="STD-March-2007" TYPE="STUDY">March 2007</LINK>).</P>

Similarly, a one year open-label extension of an 8 week RCT of clomipramine for OCD reduced the total score on the CY-BOCS by more than half (23 to 9.8) amongst completers (<LINK REF="STD-DeVeaugh_x002d_Geiss-1992" TYPE="STUDY">DeVeaugh-Geiss 1992</LINK>). Nevertheless, the relapse-prevention phases of two trials of fluoxetine for the treatment of paediatric OCD (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liebowitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liebowitz 2002</LINK>) failed to demonstrate overall superiority to placebo in the long-term efficacy of this medication in reducing relapse (RR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.55, 1.11, n = 211).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.2) Adverse events during long-term treatment and its discontinuation (narrative review)</HEADING>
<P>With regards to the side-effect profile of medication taken over the long term, a relatively high withdrawal rate due to adverse events (16/137) was observed in a 52 week open-label maintenance intervention for OCD patients who completed 12 weeks of controlled treatment with sertraline (<LINK REF="STD-March-1998" TYPE="STUDY">March 1998</LINK>). The most common of these were hyperkinesia and aggressive reactions in four and two children, respectively. Grand mal convulsions were observed in two adolescents in this study, with convulsions in one of the patients considered drug-related. A suicide attempt and a suicidal gesture in one patient was attributed to concurrent depression, while suicidal ideation in another was considered to be related to diagnosis of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder. Approximately three quarters (76%) of patients who participated in the extension phase of <LINK REF="STD-March-1998" TYPE="STUDY">March 1998</LINK> experienced newly emergent treatment-related adverse events.</P>
<P>Discontinuation of acute treatment with paroxetine resulted in a greater incidence of nausea and vomiting in <LINK REF="STD-Geller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2004</LINK>, and more frequent instances of nausea, dizziness and abdominal pain in <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2004</LINK>. A significantly greater proportion of participants in the medication group experienced withdrawal-related side effects in the latter study. A withdrawal syndrome characterised by confusion and agitation was observed in a 10-year-old girl 24 hours after the last taper dose was administered in an RCT of venlafaxine (<LINK REF="STD-Rynn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rynn 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>This review provides evidence of the efficacy of medication in the short-term treatment of childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders. Almost twice as many patients responded to treatment with medication (59%) as placebo (31%). This translates to four paediatric patients requiring treatment with medication before one responds to the agent.<B> </B>An overall effect of medication in reducing the severity of anxiety disorder symptoms was also observed. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the effects of medication in reducing symptom severity and increasing treatment response held for both paediatric OCD, as well as certain other anxiety disorders.</P>
<P>The overwhelming majority of evidence of efficacy was for the SSRIs, with the most evidence in paediatric OCD. This finding is consistent with expert consensus that the SSRIs be regarded as first line treatments for paediatric OCD (<LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 2002</LINK>). This review found little evidence for differences between SSRI agents in efficacy. Preliminary evidence of an improvement in functioning following short-term treatment with the SSRIs fluoxetine and paroxetine was observed. This is a potentially significant result given the chronicity of anxiety disorders if left untreated, and their potential to disrupt social and psychological development in paediatric populations. <BR/>
</P>
<P>Inconsistent findings have been reported for trials assessing the long-term efficacy<B> </B>of treatment with medication. Although the observation of continued response to maintenance treatment with fluoxetine supports the consensus that long-term maintenance therapy is indicated for paediatric anxiety disorders, the synthesis in this review of relapse rates for two fluoxetine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liebowitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liebowitz 2002</LINK>) failed to detect evidence that this agent was effective in reducing relapse. While open-label treatment of OCD with sertraline over a year led to significant improvements in treatment response beyond that detected after acute treatment, this finding should be weighed against the high rate of newly emergent drug-related adverse events observed (<LINK REF="STD-March-1998" TYPE="STUDY">March 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Drug-related adverse events</HEADING>
<P>A significant proportion of children and adolescents included in this review withdrew due to drug-related adverse events. No agent was more likely to result in treatment discontinuation for this reason. Nevertheless, the finding of particularly high drop-out rates amongst children and adolescents receiving higher doses of sertraline for OCD (<LINK REF="STD-March-1998" TYPE="STUDY">March 1998</LINK>), and no evidence in controlled trials of a relationship between dosage and efficacy amongst the SSRIs (<LINK REF="STD-RUPPASG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">RUPPASG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 2001</LINK>), has led to the suggestion that SSRI agents be initiated at a relatively low dose. There was no difference in the tolerability of the SNRI venlafaxine and the SSRIs, which, when combined with the evidence of this agent's efficacy in treating paediatric GAD, suggests that venlafaxine should be considered as a treatment option for this disorder. The finding of a significant difference in the height of patients after medication treatment in an 8 week placebo-controlled trial of venlafaxine extended-release (<LINK REF="STD-Rynn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rynn 2007</LINK>) indicates that potential delays in physical development should be monitored during long-term treatment with this medication.</P>
<P>Considerable attention has been devoted recently to the possibility that treatment with antidepressants (with a focus on SSRIs) may induce suicidal behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00f6_ller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Möller 2008</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis commissioned by the FDA concluded that antidepressants as a group increase the risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2006</LINK>). This finding was based on an analysis of both MDD and anxiety disorder clinical trials. A review of RCTs of sertraline in which suicidality was separated by disorder concluded, on the other hand, concluded that the benefit-risk ratio for treating OCD in children and adolescents with SSRIs was more favourable than the use of the same agents for MDD (<LINK REF="STD-March-2006" TYPE="STUDY">March 2006</LINK>). In the antidepressant trials included in this study, only 13 patients experienced suicidal behaviour or ideation, with 5 and 7 of these occuring in RCTs of paroxetine and venlafaxine, respectively. The relatively high proportion of such suicidality in paroxetine trials is consistent with the recommendation by the FDA against the use of this agent for paediatric depression (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-Talk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA Talk 2003</LINK>), and the reports of increased rates of suicides in some cohort studies of venlafaxine in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Rubino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubino 2007</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Tiihonen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiihonen 2006</LINK>). It should be noted, however, that the absolute rate of suicidal ideation for both these agents was low<BR/>(approx. 1%), and that no completed suicides were observed in any of the trials included in this review. The perceived risks of pharmacotherapy for paediatric anxiety disorders also needs to be weighed against increased suicidal ideation and behaviour  associated with failing to treat these disorders, as illustrated by reports of increases in suicide attempts after FDA warnings led to fewer prescriptions for antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2006</LINK>). Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of the need for careful monitoring after initiation of SSRIs in treating this population (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 2004</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological and clinical moderators of treatment response</HEADING>
<P>No evidence was detected in this review of a difference in treatment effect between studies conducted in multi-centre versus single-centre trials. Trials funded by the pharmaceutical industry demonstrated greater reductions in the severity of anxiety disorder symptoms than those that were funded by other sources. Source of funding has been associated with biased reporting of results in other health-care fields (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2003</LINK>). This review failed to detect an effect of excluding patients with MDD on the primary outcomes of this review . Although the power of this comparison to detect an effect was low, it is consistent with the lack of evidence in this review that pharmacotherapy reduces scores on depression scales. This suggests that reductions in the severity of anxiety disorder symptoms as a result of treatment are probably not mediated by the effect of medication on symptoms of depression.</P>
<P>An insufficient number of RCTs in this review stratified outcome data by age group to determine whether efficacy and tolerability differed for children and adolescents. A greater incidence of drug-related adverse effects were observed after treatment of OCD with paroxetine amongst children than adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2004</LINK>). Hyperkinesia was the most common symptom leading to treatment withdrawal in this study, with dropouts for this reason occuring in children only (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2004</LINK>).<B> </B>Activation has generally been reported as more commonly observed in children than adolescents following administration of SSRIs, and as one of the major causes of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safer 2006</LINK>). Questions remain about the adjustment of dosage for the different age bands, though it would be prudent to start treatment in children with the minimum therapeutic dose. It has been recommended that children receive at most two-thirds (200 mg/d) of the maximum dose of fluvoxamine administered to adolescents (300 mg/d), on the basis of the finding that weight-adjusted steady-state plasma concentrations were 2 to 3 times higher in the younger group (<LINK REF="REF-Cheer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheer 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>A number of meta-analyses of RCTs of pharmacotherapy for paediatric anxiety disorders have recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>). The relatively greater reduction in the severity of symptoms of non-OCD disorders compared to OCD observed in this review (SMD = -0.82 versus -0.52, respectively) is consistent with the <LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK> finding that the effects of antidepressants are strongest for non-OCD anxiety disorders, followed by OCD and then MDD. Likewise, the finding of significant variation in the size of treatment effects for non-OCD RCTs was confirmed in <LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK>, who also reported a trend for a greater reduction in symptom severity in adolescents for non-OCD anxiety disorders. This review adds to the <LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK> findings by including RCTs published after 2006, and also demonstrating larger and less consistent effects for non-OCD than OCD trials on a dichotomous measure of treatment response (CGI-I). The observation in both <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK> and an earlier meta-analysis of SSRIs for paediatric OCD (<LINK REF="REF-Geller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 2003</LINK>) that clomipramine has the largest effect of all medication agents was replicated in this review. Nevertheless, this finding must be qualified by the observation that it is based on data from a single small trial of clomipramine (<LINK REF="STD-DeVeaugh_x002d_Geiss-1992" TYPE="STUDY">DeVeaugh-Geiss 1992</LINK>). Clomipramine is generally regarded as a second-line agent in paediatric OCD, given its more severe side-effect profile and the need to monitor for blood and cardiac irregularities.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK> concluded that both CBT and medication are effective in reducing the severity of symptoms of OCD in children and adolescents. Although the effect sizes they reported were larger for CBT than medication RCTs (ES = 1.45 versus 0.48, respectively) a Cochrane review assessing the overall effect of CBT on all paediatric anxiety disorders reported an effect size on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (SMD = -0.58) and the Fear Survey for Children Revised (SMD = -0.55) of similar magnitude to that observed in this review (<LINK REF="REF-James-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2005</LINK>). Caution is advised in interpreting the results of such indirect comparisons of the efficacy of different treatment modalities, however, given the non-equivalence of control groups typically employed in RCTs of CBT and pharmacotherapy. Recently a number of RCTs have compared the efficacy<B> </B>of CBT and medication directly (<LINK REF="STD-Beidel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Beidel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walkup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Walkup 2008</LINK>). A 12 week program of Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) was superior to fluoxetine in reducing social distress and behavioural avoidance and in increasing general functioning and social skills (<LINK REF="STD-Beidel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Beidel 2007</LINK>). Although there was no difference between sertraline and CBT in reducing symptom severity over 12 weeks, CBT proved superior in an analysis of remission and clinical significance (<LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>). Notably, the largest effects in all comparisons were obtained when combining CBT with sertraline. This is consistent with the patterns of results reported in a study employing a similar design (<LINK REF="STD-Walkup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Walkup 2008</LINK>), in which combination of sertraline and CBT demonstrated superior efficacy to either modality on its own. The observation in two of these studies of a levelling off of the effects of medication but not CBT on symptom severity after 8 weeks suggests that differences in efficacy between these modalities may emerge with long term treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Beidel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Beidel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walkup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Walkup 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness, applicability and quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of factors limiting the strength of the conclusions that can be supported by this review. The majority of the trials excluded patients with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, thereby excluding individuals who are arguably more resistant to treatment, more prone to relapse following discontinuation of pharmacotherapy, and more typical of general population samples (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 2001b</LINK>). Most of the trials assessed short-term treatment with medication, and therefore do not speak to the long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy. Insufficient data was available to compare treatment response for children and adolescents, despite requests to trial investigators for this information. Finally, the findings of this review were based on a small number of RCTs. This is largely due to the paucity of research in this area, despite inducements such as the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (<LINK REF="REF-BPCA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPCA 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>No controlled evidence could be found for the efficacy of benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="STD-Graae-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Graae 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simeon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Simeon 1992</LINK>) to warrant their increasing prescription for paediatric patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zito-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zito 2003</LINK>). The lack of evidence of efficacy, combined with their potential for abuse and dependence, has led to the suggestion that trials making use of benzodiazepines be kept short and confined to acute cases of anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Masi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masi 2001</LINK>). Further support for this approach comes from the finding of a high dropout rate due to disinhibition and the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events following even low-dose (0.25 - 2 mg/d ) acute treatment with clonazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Graae-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Graae 1994</LINK>). This is despite suggestions that the faster breakdown of these agents in children renders them relatively non-toxic (<LINK REF="REF-Simeon-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simeon 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents were regarded for the purposes of this review as forming a continuum with adult anxiety disorders, despite evidence that certain forms of childhood anxiety disorders, such as the Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder (PANDAS)<B> </B>variant of OCD, are qualitatively distinct from the adult form. Moreover, the observation of significant variability for both treatment response and symptom severity in post-hoc analyses of outcome data from non-OCD populations suggests that the decision to treat children and adolescents diagnosed with SP, SAD or GAD as a unitary group may not be warranted.</P>

<P>Medication treatments can be effective in childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders, acting to reduce core symptoms, and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. Although there is also no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other, the majority of trials contributing evidence of efficacy to date have been with the SSRIs. Evidence of withdrawal from treatment due to drug-related adverse events, absence of evidence that clearly identifies clinical predictors of treatment response, and a lack of available evidence of a relationship between medication dosage and efficacy indicates that it would be prudent to initiate treatment at the lower end of the recommended dose range. Conversely, care should be taken to ensure that adequate doses are administered, given the finding that medications are generally well-tolerated over the short-term. The routine use of benzodiazepines can not be recommended, as there is insufficient efficacy data from controlled trials to offset potential adverse effects of this agent. The evidence supporting the value of long-term medication interventions is limited and inconsistent, and needs to be weighed against the possible emergence of adverse events with continued treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-11 13:15:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Controlled studies of the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for paediatric anxiety disorders are remarkably sparse, given recognition of the early age of onset for anxiety disorders, and the poor prognosis for many young people who do not receive treatment. Future RCTs could help identify potential moderators of treatment efficacy through assessing the impact of clinical heterogeneity on treatment outcome. Examples include conducting studies designed to tease apart the influence of psychiatric comorbidity on treatment response, and facilitating the synthesis of data across trials by improving the quality of reporting (e.g. stratifying outcomes by age group). Reporting outcomes separately for different diagnostic groups might also help explain some of the variation in treatment response. Finally, future direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, dose-comparison studies, and controlled assessments of the long-term efficacy and tolerability of medication treatment are warranted.</P>

<P>The stratification of the primary outcomes by whether they were reported for RCTs of OCD was added to the review, in recognition (a) that this is consistent with how these disorders have been grouped by other researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Birmaher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birmaher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RUPPASG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">RUPPASG 2001</LINK>), and (b) that this distinction has the potential to describe a substantial amount of heterogeneity observed in the primary outcomes.</P>
<P>A comparison of the number of patients who relapsed (as defined by the trial investigators), as well as a descriptive review of adverse events following long-term maintenance and treatment discontinuation have been added as secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>The section on studies with multiple treatment groups in the Methods section of the protocol has been omitted from the review. This section described the procedure involved in the analysis of data from RCTs comparing multiple medications as well as different dosages of medication. The only study comparing different medications (<LINK REF="STD-Rapoport-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rapoport 1980</LINK>) did not provide data for inclusion in the comparisons, while there were no dosage-comparison studies that were eligible for inclusion. In the event of studies being identified in future which are configured in this way and have extractable data, advice may be sought from CCDAN statisticians as to the advisability of multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM, also known as <I>network meta-analysis</I>).</P>
<P>Additional information provided in the protocol on the procedure followed for the analysis of outcome data from cross-over trials which either provided data from the first period of treatment or included a washout period of sufficient duration was omitted from the review, as none of the cross-over trials included in this review satisfied these criteria. The protocol included the following paragraph:</P>
<P>"For cross-over trials in which the washout period was regarded as adequate, data from both periods will be included when it is possible to determine the standard error of the mean difference in response between groups (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). The summary statistics required to derive the standard error of interest will be obtained from the trial report, or for trials for which this information was missing, and will be imputed through averaging the relevant statistic from other included crossover trials with comparable control conditions." In the event of studies being identified in future with relevant data, these methods or others recommended by CCDAN statisticians will be employed.</P>
