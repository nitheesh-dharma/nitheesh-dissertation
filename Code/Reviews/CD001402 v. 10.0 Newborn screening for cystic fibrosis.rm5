<P>This update has identified three further publications from the UK trial (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>) and nine from the Wisconsin trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). Doull presents revised total birth numbers in the screened and unscreened arms, updates figures for total CF diagnoses in the screened and unscreened arms, and reports mortality to five years in the UK trial (<LINK REF="REF-Doull-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doull 2001</LINK>). The authors report seven deaths out of a total of 176 affected children. Three occurred in those with meconium ileus, while the remaining four all occurred in children in the unscreened arm who had no affected older sibling. Two of these children had been diagnosed clinically by seven weeks of age. Conference abstracts from both the UK and Wisconsin trials suggest that airway function as assessed by spirometry does not differ between screened and unscreened infants, but data have not been presented in a form that can be incorporated in this update.</P>
<P>Data on pulmonary function, chest radiograph scores, screening costs and vitamin E deficiency were reported in the new reports of the Wisconsin trial. At seven years of age, differences in mean (standard deviation (SD)) % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC (94 (1.8)% versus 95 (1.3)% screened versus control) were not statistically significant. At this age, 88% of screened participants and 75% of control participants had lung function parameters within the normal limits at 89% predicted or greater. Over time until 16 years of age, both groups showed mild pulmonary dysfunction. Differences in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC, % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> and RV/TLC were not significant between screened and control participants. At time of diagnosis chest radiograph scores were significantly better among screened particiapnts. Longitudinal assessments between ages 5 and 16 years revealed worse scores over time in the screened group. Results, however, were no longer significant after adjustment for differences in genotype, pancreatic status, and <I>P. aeruginosa</I>-culture results. Screened participants had a much longer duration of infection and were earlier colonised with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> than control participants. Although fewer screened patients had vitamin E deficiency, these data were subject to lead time bias. A more recent estimation of direct medical costs of screening suggested diagnosis through screening is less expensive than through traditional means. There is not substantive change following this update of the review.</P>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Screening newborn babies for cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In people with cystic fibrosis lung disease and malnutrition occur very early in life. These complications are suited to early treatment. Newborn screening may therefore improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to find out whether newborn screening prevents or reduces organ damage and improves clinical outcomes in people with CF without unacceptable adverse effects. This review includes two trials with 1,124,483 babies (210 with cystic fibrosis). The trials compared newborn screening to clinical diagnosis. We were only able to analyse data from one of the trials. This trial showed that severe malnutrition was less common among screened babies. Screened babies had better chest radiograph scores at diagnosis, but these scores became worse over time. The screened babies become colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> earlier. Costs for screening were less than costs for traditional diagnosis. </P>

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine whether newborn screening for CF prevents or reduces irreversible organ damage and improves clinical outcomes, quality of life and survival in people with CF without unacceptable adverse effects. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-06-16 16:18:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>The Group's Trials Register last searched: June 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, published and unpublished, comparing screening to clinical diagnosis in people with CF.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and independently extracted data. Allocation concealment was unclear in both studies and sequence generation adequate in one.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Searches identified six trials. Two trials involving 1,124,483 neonates (210 with CF) with a maximum follow up of 17 years were eligible for inclusion. Varying study designs, outcomes reported and summary measures precluded calculation of pooled estimates and only data from one study were analysed. Severe malnutrition was less common among screened participants. Compared with screened participants, the odds ratio of weight below the tenth percentile was 4.12 (95% CI 1.64 to 10.38) and for height was 4.62 (95% CI 1.69 to 12.61) in the control group.</P>
<P>At age seven, 88% of screened participants and 75% of controls had lung function parameters within normal limits of at least 89% predicted. At diagnosis chest radiograph scores were significantly better among screened participants; 33% of screened versus 50% of control participants had Wisconsin chest X-ray (WCXR) scores over five (P = 0.097) and 24% of screened versus 45% of control participants had Brasfield chest X-ray (BCXR) scores under 21 (P = 0.042)). Over time, chest radiograph scores were worse in the screened group (WCXR P = 0.017 and BCXR P = 0.041). Results were no longer significant after adjustment for genotype, pancreatic status, and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>-culture results. In screened participants colonisation with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> occurred earlier. Estimates suggest diagnosis through screening is less expensive. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials assessing neonatal screening in CF were identified; data from one study were included. Nutritional benefits are apparent. Screening provides potential for better pulmonary outcomes, but confounding factors influenced long-term pulmonary prognosis of people with CF. Screening seems less expensive than traditional diagnosis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-16 16:21:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-06-16 16:20:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disorders among Caucasians, with an estimated incidence in Caucasians throughout the world of between 0.25 to 5 per 10,000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1995</LINK>). CF is found in most other races but to a lesser frequency than in the Caucasian race. Pulmonary disease is the most important cause of severe disability and premature death in people with CF. Recent evidence suggests that pulmonary inflammation in CF occurs very early in life. Airway inflammation has been identified in affected infants by four weeks of age and it has been suggested that this can occur without prior infection (<LINK REF="REF-Balough-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balough 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1995</LINK>). Bacterial lower respiratory tract infections, particularly those due to <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>), are common and associated with significant pulmonary deterioration. These are amenable to antibiotic therapy resulting in clearance of pathogens and reduction of inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-06-16 16:20:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Neonatal screening for CF became feasible with the development in 1979 of a radioimmunoassay for immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) suitable for use on dried blood spots from newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1998</LINK>). IRT levels are elevated in the first few weeks of life in babies with CF. However, in the first week of life, when most newborn blood samples are routinely taken; specificity of a single elevated IRT is low. Thus two or three stage protocols based on a second IRT test with or without subsequent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analyses have been developed to reduce the false positive diagnoses associated with one stage IRT testing (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-06-16 16:20:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Over the past 30 years there has been a marked increase in the life expectancy of people with CF such that in the United Kingdom predicted median life expectancy for the current cohort of CF infants is about 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-Elborn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elborn 1991</LINK>). Most, but not all, of this increase has been attributed to improvements in therapy and it has been argued that therapeutic interventions administered before the onset of signs or symptoms may have the greatest long-term benefit. This has led to the hypothesis that presymptomatic diagnosis, for example by newborn (neonatal) screening, and early treatment may prevent or reduce irreversible pulmonary damage and optimise early nutritional status and thereby improve outcome and quality of life in people with CF.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-16 16:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Despite acceptable test performance, the effectiveness of neonatal screening in reducing CF mortality and morbidity remains controversial. In 1983 the American Cystic Fibrosis Foundation identified a need for further information on the benefits and risks of early diagnosis and treatment before newborn screening could be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Task-Force-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Task Force 1983</LINK>). A number of studies have been published from different countries. Dankert-Roelse observed that those identified by neonatal screening had less pulmonary inflammation and less deterioration of lung function than those detected on clinical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dankert_x002d_Roelse-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dankert-Roelse 1995</LINK>). Farrell found that neonatal screening provides the opportunity to prevent malnutrition in infants with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1997</LINK>). However, neonatal screening for CF may also be associated with adverse effects. False positive screening results may adversely affect the parents' relationship with their baby (<LINK REF="REF-Tluczek-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tluczek 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baroni-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baroni 1997</LINK>). In addition, false reassurance among those with false-negative screening tests may lead to delays in clinical diagnosis and loss of an opportunity to give genetic counselling at an appropriate time. There may be a risk of "labelling" those with mild disease who might not have presented clinically and exposing them to unnecessary treatments or interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcken-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcken 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of newborn screening reflects the potential biases of non-experimental comparisons of screened populations. Given the recognised cohort effect in CF mortality (and presumably morbidity), comparisons between earlier unscreened cohorts and later screened cohorts may incorrectly attribute the better outcome in screened cohorts to earlier diagnosis. Comparisons based on non-experimental studies using concurrent controls may also be biased as non-random assignment of centres or regions to screening may be confounded with social factors or access to medical care which may influence outcome. Thus careful assessment of the methodological quality of trials reporting evaluations of screening is crucial to their interpretation and entails modification of the criteria to those conventionally used to assess trials reporting interventions in clinically defined groups (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review aims to establish whether there is evidence that early diagnosis of CF by means of neonatal screening, followed by current treatment, improves survival and long-term morbidity, without unacceptable adverse effects.</P>

<P>Summary details are given in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' section.</P>
<P>Over time more non-randomised studies on the effect of newborn screening for CF in different countries all over the world have been published. In this review only RCTs were included.</P>
<P>The two included trials reported screening based on a population of 1,124,483 neonates; 552,354 (49.1%) of whom were allocated to the screened group and 572,129 (50.9%) to the control group (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). A total of 210 CF participants were included in the analysis. The participants ranged from 0 to 16 years of age. Length of follow up reported ranged from one year (<LINK REF="REF-Mischler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mischler 1998</LINK>) to 16 years (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the UK Trial, screening took place on alternate weeks from January 1985 to December 1989 in Wales and from January 1985 to October 1989 in the West Midlands (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>). Neonates born in the central Birmingham area were excluded from this trial, and all participants with meconium ileus were looked after in a central Birmingham hospital. We were concerned that it was not clear from the original paper whether these infants were included in the control arm of the study, which would lead to ascertainment bias. Having contacted the original investigators from the study, we received confirmation that any babies born in Central Birmingham were not screened because blood was collected with a capillary system, not on a 'card'. These babies were not included in the control population of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Weller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weller 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>As expected, the numbers of children diagnosed with CF in both arms of the UK Trial have increased with increasing follow up, hence numbers of affected children vary between reports of the same trial. Data from the most recent published report of this trial indicate that 230,076 neonates were randomised to be screened for CF and 234,510 to not receive a screening test (<LINK REF="REF-Doull-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doull 2001</LINK>). After a repeated positive screening test, performed by measurement of immunoreactive trypsin, diagnosis of CF was confirmed by sweat testing. Control participants were diagnosed by clinical manifestations of the disease or family history and diagnosis was confirmed by sweat testing. Methods used to identify these cases were not stated.</P>
<P>At the most recent follow up, 86 children with CF were identified in the group randomised to screening, of whom 70 were detected by screening; an additional 16 children were screened but were not detected by screening (false negative diagnoses). Eight screened infants presented with meconium ileus while six had affected older siblings, two of whom were also among those with false negative screening results. Hence, the detection rate in this trial was 81% (58 out of 72), excluding those with a family history or meconium ileus. Median age at diagnosis in the screened group was eight weeks (range 3 to 22 weeks) reflecting variable diagnostic and management policies at the time of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the group randomised to 'no screening', 90 children were diagnosed as having CF of whom 19 had meconium ileus and 14 an affected older sibling (of whom one had both meconium ileus and an affected older sibling). Age of diagnosis in the unscreened group (excluding those with meconium ileus) ranged from 6 weeks to 22 months. In the original reports of clinical outcomes, nine children with a false-negative screening result were included in the control group; hence the early reports of outcomes are not based on an intention-to-screen analysis. Comparing 58 screened infants with 44 (35 plus nine false negatives), the authors reported that mean (standard deviation (SD)) age at diagnosis in the screened participants was 9.1 (3.1) weeks and 50.7 (60.5) weeks in the control participants. Median ages were not reported. At the time of this published report 12 screened and seven control participants had reached four years of age (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Wisconsin Trial, 650,341 neonates were screened for CF (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). The screening test was performed on all infants but only half of the families were informed about the results in the neonatal period. Initially the trial used a two-stage immune reactive trypsin protocol, but subsequently this was altered to immune reactive trypsin followed by DNA testing for the delta F508 mutation, reflecting genetic advances during the course of the trial. Data from the control participants were computer-stored and the families and investigators were masked to the newborn screening results until the children reached four years of age, unless parents requested the information before then (<LINK REF="REF-Fost-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fost 1989</LINK>). Confirmation of diagnosis by sweat testing took place after a positive screening result in the screened group during the neonatal period and in the control group after the child's fourth birthday when unmasking of the data revealed the children with a positive screening test, unless CF had been diagnosed earlier through other means. Thus, in comparison with the UK Trial, the total number of CF diagnoses in each arm was made at this point and did not increase with increasing follow up. However, due to differences in the beginning of the follow up between screened and control participants, data reported before the unblinding of the control data were subject to lead time bias. Participants with meconium ileus were excluded from analysis. Longitudinal data were analysed by a repeated-measures analysis using generalised estimating equation (GEE) methods. Analyses were adjusted for different covariates as described under results.</P>
<P>In the screened arm there were 77 infants; 16 diagnosed through meconium ileus, two diagnosed through family history, 54 through screening test alone, and five with a false-negative screening test (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). The control group included 81 infants or children, 18 of whom had meconium ileus, 42 were diagnosed clinically before and 21 were diagnosed clinically after the unblinding of the control screening results at four years of age. Excluding participants with meconium ileus, mean (SD) age at diagnosis in the screened participants was reported as 13 (37) weeks and 107 (117) weeks in control participants. Median (range) age at diagnosis was seven (4 to 281) weeks in the screened and 28 (3 to 372) weeks in the control participants. At the time of the most recent published report for follow up, two screened and four control participants had reached 16 years. The following chest radiograph scores were used in this trial: Wisconsin chest X-ray (WCXR) scores which range from 0 (normal) to 100 (most severe) and the Brasfield chest X-ray (BCXR) scores which range from 25 (normal) to 3 (most severe).</P>
<P>Of the outcomes specified in the prior hypothesis of the review, nutritional status, chest radiograph scores, spirometry, number of hospital days and Shwachman-Kulczycki scores were reported in both studies. However, the specific summary measures employed and radiograph methods varied between the two studies.</P>
<P>Conference abstracts reporting chest radiographic scores and spirometry have been published for both trials: radiographic methods varied. In the Wisconsin Trial nutritional status was summarised as z score for weight and height, proportion of participants with weight and height below the 10th percentile, weight percentile and proportion of participants with height below the fifth percentile, measured at age at diagnosis and during the follow up with a time interval of one year. The UK Trial reported SD scores for weight and height, measured from the age of one year at yearly intervals (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>). Number of hospital days in the Wisconsin Trial were reported as the mean (SD) number per person per year throughout the total follow-up period and in UK Trial as the mean (SD) number at the ages of one and two years. Finally, Shwachman-Kulczycki score was reported at age at diagnosis in the Wisconsin Trial but at the ages one and two years in the UK Trial. The number of respiratory exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics, number of respiratory complications, the occurrence of diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis and adverse effects in the CF group diagnosed by screening were not reported in either included trial.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-09-23 14:11:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In order to assess the risk of bias in the included studies, the methodological quality was examined using modified criteria suggested by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). To clarify certain methodological terms used in this review, we have made the following glossary (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 12:51:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Concealment of allocation and method used to generate the random sequence were assigned to one of three categories: adequate, unclear or inadequate. These corresponded to a low, unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Sequence generation was adequate in one trial and was so thought to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). In this trial blood samples were obtained from all newborn infants in Wisconsin and randomly divided into two equal groups depending on the last digit of the code number assigned to the specimen (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). In the other trial, babies were allocated to either screening or non-screening on alternate weeks, but the investigators do not state how the initial randomisation took place resulting in an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>). 
</P>
<P>In the Wisconsin trial, the samples were sent to a centralised laboratory before being allocated to the screening or non-screening group, thus preventing clinicians being able to foretell the allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). We therefore deemed there to be a low risk of bias from this trial. We considered allocation concealment to be inadequate in the trial using alternation and therefore deemed there to be a risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>).</P>

<P>Blinded assessment of outcome was recorded as either present or absent. RCTs were categorised according to whether double blinding had been reported or not. A higher number of people blinded in trials relates to a lower risk of bias.</P>
<P>Blinded assessment of outcome was not reported in either of the included studies, leading to an unclear risk of bias.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-23 13:05:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The reported 'Intention-to-screen' analysis was defined as complete, or analysed with less than 15% exclusions, or analysed with more than 15% exclusions. We regarded complete analysis or one with less than 15% exclusions to have a low risk of bias. We judged any analysis with more than 15% exclusions to be at risk of bias. If exclusions were not discussed, we judged there to be an unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Excluding participants with meconium ileus, performance of an intention-to-screen-analysis was possible in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>); and not possible in the other (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>).

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2008-09-23 14:11:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>CF is a highly variable disease clinically. Both experimental and non-experimental comparisons may be subject to different types of bias. Firstly, there is ascertainment bias, this refers to whether the methods by which participants are entered into each group are comparable and can result in the screened group containing people with mild disease that would not have presented clinically. Similarly unscreened people with CF with severe disease may never be diagnosed because of dying at a young age. This is likely to result in biased comparisons of outcome in early life. This bias is likely to diminish but may not disappear with increasing duration of follow up. Ascertainment bias may be avoided by ensuring uniform probability of ascertainment in the screened and unscreened groups. The method to ascertain that cases in screened and control groups was categorised as similar yes or no, similarity means there is a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The method to ascertain cases was similar in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>) and not similar in the other (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>). Therefore, the Wisconsin Trial was thought to have a low risk of bias, whereas the the UK Trial was thought to have an increased risk of bias.</P>
<P>Secondly, lead time bias. This type of bias occurs especially when one group has been diagnosed earlier in the natural history of the disease than the other group. We considered both studies to have a potential risk from lead time bias (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-04 16:36:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Due to differences in study design (and the different summary measures of the outcomes employed), it was not possible to combine the data from both included trials.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Although the UK Trial met the inclusion criteria, we have not presented data from this trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>). We decided to exclude these data from the table of comparisons for two reasons. Firstly, from the published data available at this time, performance of an intention-to-screen analysis was not possible in this trial and secondly the UK Trial was subject to ascertainment bias.</P>
<P>Therefore, we have only presented data from the Wisconsin Trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). Due to the lead time bias, only data after the unblinding of the control data at four years of age were analysed and reported here.</P>

<P>Pulmonary function data from the Wisconsin Trial have recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2003</LINK>). Differences in lung function between participant groups were reported only as P values, therefore at present the data cannot be entered in the data tables for this review. At seven years of age the % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC for the screened and control groups were not significantly different (P = 0.54). However, at this age 88% of the observations in the screened group and 75% of the observations in the control group were within the normal limits at 89% predicted or greater. Repeated measures analysis, adjusting for covariates CF center, sex, age, genotype, pancreatic status, and indicators of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection showed that over time until 16 years of age, there were no statistically significant differences between screened and non-screened participants in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or FVC (P = 0.32) or in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (P = 0.18), FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> (P = 0.37) and RV/TLC (P = 0.25).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Chest radiograph scores</HEADING>
<P>The first available WCXR and BCXR scores were significantly better among screened participants at an average age of 14.3 weeks in the screened group compared with 108 weeks for the control participants. Mean (SD) WCXR score in the screened group (49 participants) was 4.20 (4.90) and in the control group (40 participants) 7.00 (5.69), mean difference (MD) -2.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.03 to -0.57). Mean (SD) BCXR score among screened participants was 21.70 (2.10) versus 20.60 (2.5) among control participants, MD 1.10 (95% CI 0.13 to 2.07). Before the unblinding of data, differences in first chest X-ray scores were adjusted for differences in age at the time of diagnosis between groups, moreover differences were adjusted for genotype and pancreatic status. Compared with control participants, significantly fewer screened participants had discriminators of potentially irreversible lung disease; 33% of screened versus 50% of control participants had WCXR scores greater than five (P = 0.097) and 24% of screened versus 45% of control participants had BCXR scores less than 21 (P = 0.042). Measures of hyperinflation on the other hand were not significant between groups. Longitudinal assessment of chest radiograph abnormalities, analysed as described under lung function, using only the data recorded after five years of age revealed worse scores over time in the screened group (P = 0.017 for WCXR and P = 0.041 for BCXR). At 14 years of age 10 screened participants were compared with 12 control participants. Reasons for including only a limited amount of participants were not mentioned. Mean (SD) WCXR score was 23.71 (12.97) among screened participants and 11.80 (7.97) among control participants, MD -2.80 (95% CI -5.03 to -0.57) P = 0.015. Mean (SD) BCXR scores were 16.40 (3.48) in the screened group versus 19.50 (2.77) in the control group, MD -3.10 (95% CI -5.77 to -0.43) P = 0.025. Results, however, were no longer significant after adjustment for differences in genotype, pancreatic status, and <I>P. aeruginosa</I>-culture results. Analysis of covariance revealed that <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection explained most variability on chest radiograph scores.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Nutritional status</HEADING>
<P>In the Wisconsin Trial, only mean values and standard deviations for nutritional data at the time of diagnosis were reported. At present therefore, data relating to outcomes at specified ages cannot be entered in the data tables for this review. However, in the most recently published study mean z scores for both weight and height over the first 13 years of life were reported using data available for 56 screened and 47 control participants who had not presented with meconium ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2001</LINK>). Repeated measures analysis, adjusted for the covariates age, sex, center, genotype, pancreatic status, and age at diagnosis, revealed a marginally significant difference in weight for age z scores while height for age z scores were significantly higher among screened compared with control participants up to the age of 13 years. Weight or height below the tenth percentile was used as an index of severe malnutrition. The odds ratio for the risk of a weight below the tenth percentile in the control group as compared with the screened group, was calculated in the meta-analysis as being 4.12 (95% CI 1.64 to 10.38). Likewise the corresponding odds ratio for height was calculated in the meta-analysis as being 4.62 (95% CI 1.69 to 12.61). These reported analyses were adjusted for age, sex, genotype and pancreatic status at diagnosis and the findings were similar when analyses were restricted to measurements taken after four years of age or included data obtained before the diagnosis for control participants as a result of the unblinding process.</P>
<P>In the Wisconsin Trial, vitamin E deficiency was assessed among 68 non-meconium ileus participants; 37 screened and 31 control participants (<LINK REF="REF-Koscik-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koscik 2003</LINK>). Seventeen out of 37 participants of the screened participants, versus 17 out of 31 of the control participants had &#945;-Tocopherol levels less than 300 µg/dl, i.e. severe vitamin E deficiency, at the time of diagnosis. Those participants with severe vitamin E deficiency had worse cognitive development. However, these data were subject to lead time bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Survival or age at death</HEADING>
<P>This was not reported in the Wisconsin Trial. In a recent publication from the UK Trial seven children died in their first five years of life, of whom three had presented with meconium ileus (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1991" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1991</LINK>). All four deaths in the 'low risk' children, that is, in those without either meconium ileus or an affected older sibling, were in children allocated to the unscreened arm of the trial. This was reported as significant (P &lt; 0.05) using a Fisher's exact test. However, the authors suggest that newborn screening might have influenced only two of these four deaths since two of the children who died were in fact diagnosed clinically by seven weeks of age.</P>

More screened participants (19 out of 56) were treated in an old, small clinic that integrated young and old participants irrespective of their pulmonary status compared with control participants (7 out of 47). In the latest report of the Wisconsin Trial, 56 screened participants were evaluated for longitudinal development of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2005</LINK>). These individuals acquired nonmucoid <I>P. aeruginosa</I> at a median age of 1.0 years without a significant effect on chest X-ray scores and lung function. At 16 years of age all participants were colonised with mucoid <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. Non-screened participants were not included in this report.</P>

<P>Cognitive assessment data were obtained from 89 participants with CF from the Wisconsin Trial, aged 7 to 17 years (<LINK REF="REF-Koscik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koscik 2004</LINK>). The Test of Cognitive Skills, Second Edition was administered to 42 screened and 47 control participants to generate the Cognitive Skills Index (CSI) and cognitive factor scores (verbal, non-verbal and memory). Cognitive scores in the overall study population were similar to normative data: 102.5 (SD 16.6). The mean (SD) CSI scores were 104.4 (14.4) in the screened group and 99.8 (18.5) in the control group (P = 0.24). Mean (SD) scores for the 3 cognitive factors were: verbal: screened participants 104.6 (12.6) and control participants 101.8 (17.9) P = 0.45; non-verbal: screened participants 106.4 (16.5) and control participants 100.7 (18.3) P = 0.17; and memory: screened participants 100.3 (15.1) and control participants 95.4 (19.5) P = 0.23. Low cognitive scores were found to be associated with low plasma &#945;-tocopherol levels. Subgroup analysis among participants with plasma &#945;-tocopherol levels less than 300 &#956;g/dL reported worse scores among control participants: mean (SD) CSI scores for screened participants were 104.0 (16.2) versus 91.5 (15.1) for control patients, mean (SD). Verbal scores for screened participants were 104.8 (14.6) versus 93.0 (14.4) for control participants. Non-verbal scores for screened participants were 103.4 (16.3) versus 94.7 (16.2); and finally memory scores for screened participants were 100.8 (18.0) and 89.1 (17.7) for control participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">9. Quality of life (post hoc change)</HEADING>
<P>In the Wisconsin Trial, quality of life was assessed using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) among a subgroup of participants aged 10 to 15.5 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Koscik-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koscik 2005</LINK>). This questionnaire contains 87 items incorporated into 12 scales and has been validated for children 10 years and older. Seventy-eight percent of all participants who were aged 10 years or older were included in this study. Reasons for exclusion were not mentioned. Koscik compared 15 screened participants to 21 control participants. Besides age at diagnosis, both groups differed significantly with respect to genotype (there were more participants with a &#916;F508 mutation in the screened group) and lung function (average lung function measured as FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> were worse among screened participants). Lung function did not differ anymore after controlling for <I>P. aeruginosa</I> status. CHQ scale scores were similar among screened and control participants except for the change in health scale, which showed better scores for the screened participants (median (range) scores 100 (50 to 100) for screened and 75 (25 to 100) for control participants (P = 0.02).</P>

<P>Analysis of screening costs from one year (1992) based on 70,000 births were reported as the cost per individual with CF diagnosed for two types of screening (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>for the IRT and sweat tests an estimated cost of US$7,613;</LI>
<LI>for the two tier screening IRT/DNA and sweat tests an estimated cost of US$7,403.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Costs for standard diagnostic methods, based on recognition through a positive family history or signs and symptoms and 1670 sweat tests performed, were reported as US$11,377 for each individual diagnosed with CF.</P>
<P>Another recent economic assessment of screening costs was reported for the year 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>). In that year 70,797 newborn IRT tests and 2926 DNA analyses (on blood of participants with the 4% highest daily IRT levels) were performed in Wisconsin (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). The following costs were included in this economic assessment: the cost per test for the IRT/DNA screening and the cost per test for the sweat chloride testing, including technical fees and professional fees for interpretation of sweat test results. Expenses for counselling and costs for several 'sick visits' and a variety of diagnostic tests before being diagnosed with CF among non-screened participants were not included in the analysis. The total costs of CF newborn screening (IRT and DNA) was estimated to be US$9025 per newly diagnosed individual with CF and US$2.66 per screened baby. These costs are comparable with costs for screening tests such as PKU. Assuming 20 newly diagnosed people with CF, the estimated annual cost per newly diagnosed CF child using the traditional method, based on costs of sweat testing, was US$16,846, or US$4.97 per newborn infant.</P>
<P>Additional estimated costs in screened children with a true negative screening test during infancy in whom sweat testing was performed later because of symptoms or signs suspect for CF were not reported. Because only mean values without standard deviations were reported, these data cannot be entered in the data tables for this review.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 09:23:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The life expectancy of people with CF has improved enormously over the past 30 years. This systematic review aimed to establish whether there is evidence that early diagnosis of CF through neonatal screening, followed by current treatment, improves survival and long-term morbidity, without unacceptable adverse effects. We have included two eligible trials, with limited evidence on the effects of neonatal screening. This reflects methodological issues in trial design as well as reporting of data.</P>
<P>Methodological issues include ascertainment bias, lead time bias and failure to analyse data on an intention-to-screen basis. Ascertainment bias was avoided in the Wisconsin Trial as all children were screened although results only made available to half in the neonatal period (unless requested by parents). This enabled uniform probability of ascertainment, and therefore comparable groups. The methodology used in the UK Trial did not address the issue of ascertainment bias, as a screening test was not performed on all individuals. Similarly, although control participants were identified through clinical manifestations of disease and sweat testing, the methods used to identify all clinically diagnosed cases were not stated. A further issue regarding case ascertainment was that children born in central Birmingham were excluded from the trial, and all people with CF in the region with meconium ileus are managed in central Birmingham.</P>
<P>Wald suggested that outcomes assessed before four years of age, when all screen-detectable but as yet undiagnosed cases of CF in the control group in the Wisconsin Trial were revealed, should not be reported as they are subject to lead time bias (<LINK REF="REF-Wald-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wald 1998</LINK>). In response to this, the Wisconsin trialists included analyses of the nutritional data restricted to data obtained after four years of age and demonstrated and reported persistence of the significant differences in height present in analyses including these data (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The validity of results of trials of screening interventions may also be compromised by failure to use an intention-to-screen analysis where all individuals are analysed in the group to which they were originally allocated. Excluding people with CF with meconium ileus, performance of an intention-to-screen-analysis was possible in the Wisconsin Trial, but could not be made due to lack of data. An intention-to-screen analysis was not performed on data from the UK Trial because some of the false-negative participants were analysed in the control group despite originally being allocated to the screened group. The issue associated with a lack of intention-to-screen analysis could be overcome if individual patient data were available; however these were not available for this version of the review.</P>
<P>Since screening only provides an opportunity for early treatment, the effect of screening is dependent on the available therapeutic options and care of people with CF at the time of study. Therefore studies of screening are not comparable with studies examining the effects of therapeutic interventions and are more difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>Regarding the pulmonary outcomes specified in this review, Chrispin-Norman chest radiograph scores were reported in the UK Trial. In the Wisconsin Trial, screened participants at the time of diagnosis had better chest radiograph scores and more participants in the screened group had lung function tests within the normal limits at seven years of age, although differences in lung function parameters were not statistically significant between groups. Over time chest radiographs were worse in the screened groups and long-term differences in lung function were statistically not significant between groups. However, despite adequate randomisation, the screened group contained more people with CF with pancreatic insufficiency, delta-F508 genotypes and acquired <I>P. aeruginosa</I> at younger ages with more people with CF being treated at a small old clinic that integrated young and old people irrespective of their pulmonary status. Unfortunately, differences between screened and control participants regarding the several lung function parameters in the longitudinal analyses were not specified. Since only mean values for chest radiograph scores and pulmonary function were reported without standard deviations, these data cannot at present be entered in the data tables for this review.</P>
<P>Screening was associated with higher weight and height z scores in the Wisconsin Trial. After diagnosis all participants received a high energy intake (greater than 120% of daily requirement). Adequate weight gain was achieved at a significantly younger age among screened participants and screening was associated with a higher response rate within two years of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Shoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoff 2006</LINK>). In addition, fewer participants in the screened group had vitamin E deficiency at time of diagnosis. Vitamin E deficiency caused a worse cognitive function as studied among 89 participants aged 7 to 17 years (<LINK REF="REF-Koscik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koscik 2004</LINK>). Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in cognitive function in children who were screened in the Wisconsin study compared to those diagnosed conventionally (<LINK REF="REF-Koscik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koscik 2004</LINK>). Unfortunately, longitudinal nutritional data were represented only by mean values without standard deviations.</P>
<P>Overall, quality of life (QOL) did not differ significantly between screened and control participants from the Wisconsin Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wisconsin-Trial-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wisconsin Trial 1998</LINK>). At the time this trial was designed no CF-specific QOL measures validated for children and adolescents were available. Only a small proportion of participants were included in the QOL analysis and the reasons for exclusion of participants were not mentioned. A study using a CF questionnaire with a larger sample is underway (<LINK REF="REF-Koscik-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koscik 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Trial examined adverse effects among parents in the screened and control populations by comparing parents of infants with false-positive diagnoses in each arm. It is difficult to assess how meaningful these results are as the timing of the administration of the questionnaire to each group was not clear. It seems there was a large time difference (four years) between the two groups of data. Also, there was no attempt to address the effects of screening on the false-negative participants.</P>
<P>The direct medical costs of screening compared with clinical diagnosis were addressed in the Wisconsin study (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>). These suggest that in 2000 in the USA it cost almost US$8000 less to diagnose CF by screening rather than other methods. Costs have not been related to effect. Moreover, costs other than for sweat testing leading to the diagnosis of CF in non-screened individuals were not included. Therefore, the difference in costs between an early diagnosis by screening and a traditional diagnosis might even be greater.</P>
<P>Although we were unable to perform a quantitative meta-analysis due to the differences in study design and the reporting of outcomes in the two included trials, a future update of this review is planned based on individual patient data meta-analyses. At present this review has identified existing randomised trials of screening and provides a summary of the data available.</P>
<P>Screening in these trials took place in the period between 1985 and 1994. With time treatment options for CF have improved and screening to establish an early diagnosis becomes more important, not only for prognosis of people with CF but also for research on early therapeutic interventions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Newborn screening for CF benefits growth and prevents malnutrition in people with CF. Malnutrition may adversely influence cognitive function. From the available RCTs at this time, pulmonary benefits from CF newborn screening are likely in early childhood. Results on long-term pulmonary prognosis were biased by confounding factors such as infection and pancreatic status. The expense of CF newborn screening is similar to the costs for other screening tests such as phenylketonuria and is less expensive than when diagnosed clinically.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials should take account of methodological issues, but it may not be possible ethically to ensure uniform probability of ascertainment and therefore there will always be issues of ascertainment bias as well as lead time bias. The possibility of the use of randomised cluster trials in assessment of screening interventions has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 1999</LINK>) and may be useful.</P>

<P>Two secondary outcomes were later added to those for the CF Group, namely 'Cognitive function' and 'Quality of life'.  These were not initially included in the review, but trials have reported them in longer term analyses. We feel these outcomes reflect the changing aspirations of people with CF and their importance merits post hoc inclusion in the review.</P>
