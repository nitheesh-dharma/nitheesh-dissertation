<P>Using more chemotherapy drugs in combination seems to help women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer to live for longer and to delay the cancer from spreading or getting worse.

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:56:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although endometrial adenocarcinoma is a common gynaecological cancer, a comparatively small proportion of patients present with, or develop, recurrent or advanced disease. However, for those women whose disease does progress or recur the prognosis is poor and the best treatment is yet to be identified. Co-morbidity, including obesity and cardiac disease, and concerns over toxicity have prevented more extensive studies of cytotoxic chemotherapy, although there are a number of active agents.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess any benefits or adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in women with advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:59:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer specialist trials register were conducted to identify all eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs).Databases were searched from 1966 to January 2012. Literature searches were supplemented with searches of relevant trials registers and conference proceedings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs comparing chemotherapy versus another intervention (including different chemotherapy) in advanced disease were considered. Trials of adjuvant treatment or for sarcomatous tumours were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:46:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Data were extracted from the papers by review authors and authors of included studies contacted for further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:47:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen eligible trials, which recruited patients between 1974 and 2005, were identified, eight of which compared 'more' with 'less' chemotherapy. Results from these eight trials, including 1519 patients, showed that treatment consisting of 'more' chemotherapy was associated with longer overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.77 to 0.96; P = 0.005) and with longer progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 1526; HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; P &lt; 0.0001). However, serious acute toxicities were more common in women randomised to the more-intense chemotherapy regimens.</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest that any particular doublet chemotherapy was better (or worse) than any other, or that any single-agent chemotherapy was better (or worse) than another; however, data for these two comparisons were limited. There were no comparative trials of chemotherapy with endocrine therapy or best supportive care alone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:47:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggests that more-intense chemotherapy regimens may improve both OS and PFS for women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, owing to inconsistencies between cytotoxic drug combinations that have been assessed in randomised trials to date, the optimum regimen has still to be defined. Future trials should aim to include measures of quality of life (QoL) and symptom control in addition to survival and progression outcomes.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:56:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:48:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:48:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were around 280,000 cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma worldwide in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2011</LINK>); however, there is wide geographical variation. Incidence tends to be highest in more developed areas (12.9 per 100,000 per year) where there were more than 33,000 deaths from the disease in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors include chronic exposure to oestrogens such as exogenous unopposed oestrogen used as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), having few children, early onset of menstruation and late menopause. Obesity is a risk factor owing to conversion of precursor hormones to oestrogen in peripheral fat cells and rising rates of obesity in affluent countries may result in an increasing incidence of endometrial cancer. Diabetes seems to be a separate risk factor. Trials of adjuvant tamoxifen given to women being treated for breast cancer have shown that there is an increased risk of endometrial cancer from using tamoxifen (it is a weak oestrogen); an approximate doubling of the risk was seen with one to two years of therapy and a quadrupling of the risk was seen with five years of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ninety per cent of uterine cancers are adenocarcinoma and arise in the endometrium (lining of the uterus). Histological grading is split into three categories; grade I being well differentiated and grade III poorly differentiated (differentiation refers to how abnormal the cells and tissue patterns are). The degree of spread of the tumour is classified according to the Federation of International Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) staging system (<LINK REF="REF-FIGO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIGO 2009</LINK>). Eighty per cent of women who present with endometrial cancer that has not spread from the uterus have good overall survival (OS). Despite this, certain features identify women with higher risk of recurrence: certain histological subtypes (e.g. papillary serous carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma); high grade, deep invasion in the muscle of the uterus; tumour extending to the cervix; spread to lymphatic or blood vessels and extra-uterine disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bremond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bremond 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:48:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Optimum treatment for endometrial cancer depends on stage and grade. Almost 90% of women with endometrial cancer are treated by primary surgery with five-year survival rates of over 70%. Adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery may be offered if the risk of local recurrence is high (grade III or stage Ib and above) and adjuvant treatments, such as endocrine therapy or chemotherapy, have been investigated in women at high risk of recurrence. Treatment failure, defined as recurrence or spread to other parts of the body (metastases), is common particularly in women with advanced-stage disease at diagnosis or those with high-risk features in the primary tumour. It is important to distinguish between isolated pelvic relapse and relapse where the cancer has become widespread. The former can be treated by radiotherapy or exenteration surgery, which is an extensive surgical procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1996</LINK>). The latter requires palliative treatment. About one third of recurrences are localised to the pelvis and two-thirds have spread outside the pelvis (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women with local recurrences not amenable to surgery or radical irradiation and those with more extensive spread are considered for systemic therapy, which may be endocrine therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy, depending on grade and the women's general level of fitness (performance status). These women are not considered curable. The aim of systemic therapy should be palliation (relief) of symptoms, improvement in quality of life (QoL), delaying progression of the disease and extending OS. A Cochrane review of hormone therapy in advanced or recurrent disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kokka-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokka 2010</LINK>) found no good evidence to suggest that hormone treatments improve survival for these women. A separate Cochrane review of adjuvant chemotherapy (after hysterectomy) for women presenting with earlier stages of endometrial cancer amenable to surgery showed that chemotherapy may improve survival and prolong disease-free survival for these women (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:48:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been used for advanced disease. A number of drugs have shown anti-tumour activity in Phase II clinical trials, including doxorubicin, epirubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin and paclitaxel. However, the optimum combination of drugs is still not known and the full effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy on survival, progression-free survival (PFS), control of symptoms and QoL are not well established (<LINK REF="REF-Humber-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humber 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-09 10:34:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of this review is to assess the potential role of cytotoxic chemotherapy where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or where local cancer is no longer treatable with surgery or radiotherapy. It updates the original review carried out by Humber and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Humber-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humber 2007</LINK>). More recently, interest in giving adjuvant chemotherapy to women with endometrial cancer at high risk of developing metastases has grown (<LINK REF="REF-Faust-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faust 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK>). This review may therefore also provide useful insights as to which drugs or combinations of drugs may be appropriate for use in this setting.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: trials of more versus less chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the trials of more versus less chemotherapy tended to be well balanced with respect to well-known prognostic factors such as age, stage and performance status with median age across all studies ranging from 63 to 67 years (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). However, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1987</LINK>) a slightly higher proportion of women had received prior radiation in the treatment arm. In two studies, there was a higher proportion of poorly differentiated, grade III tumours in the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although not pre-specified as an outcome, the objective response rate tended to be improved in the 'more' chemotherapy arms, compared with less chemotherapy in all except two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). However, these differences were only statistically significant for two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall survival</HEADING>
<P>For the main outcomes of OS, data were available for all eight trials, including 1519 patients. Across the trials there was a significant 14% reduction the risk of death with more chemotherapy compared with less chemotherapy (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96; P = 0.005; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), with little evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.90; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). This represents a potential absolute improvement in absolute survival of about 1.5 months (from 9 to 10.5 months).</P>
<P>Despite differences in the drugs and combinations included in these trials, there was no suggestion that the results varied between subgroups (test for interaction P = 0.69). While the results for each subgroup tended towards favouring more treatment, only one of the subgroups had a significant treatment effect (doxorubicin and cisplatin in combination with other drugs compared with doxorubicin and cisplatin alone). However, as this result was based on only two trials, including 291 patients, it should be treated with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Progression-free survival</HEADING>
<P>Progression data were available for all eight trials, including 1526 patients; however, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aapro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aapro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 1994</LINK>) reported only time to progression and not PFS. While the results from these trials were combined with the PFS results of the remaining trials, they may give a somewhat different estimate of the effect of treatment, since deaths were censored rather than included as events. Overall the HR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90) across trials shows a highly significant 18% relative improvement in the time to progression/PFS with the more-intense regimens compared to the less-intense regimens (P &lt; 0.0001), which suggests an absolute improvement of approximately one month (from six to seven months).</P>
<P>The results across all trials tended to favour more chemotherapy and there was no strong evidence that the results varied either between individual trials (heterogeneity P = 0.23; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 25%) or between trial subgroups (test for interaction P = 0.19). However, the trial subgroup that compared doxorubicin and cisplatin plus other drugs versus doxorubicin and cisplatin alone and that comparing doxorubicin in combination with other drugs versus doxorubicin alone had results that were significantly in favour of the more chemotherapy arm (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acute toxicity</HEADING>
<P>To assess toxicity, three trials used the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC), either version 1 (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>), or version 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004a</LINK>). Four trials used either the WHO/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (<LINK REF="STD-Aapro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aapro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 1994</LINK>) or the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 2004</LINK>). One further trial did not state which scale was used (<LINK REF="STD-Horton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 1982</LINK>). However, as all trials used a 5-point system where 0 was no toxicity and 5 was toxicity-related death, it was appropriate to combine data across all trials.</P>
<P>Data on serious (i.e. grade 3 or 4) nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea/other GI toxicity, white blood cell toxicity, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and alopecia were available in sufficient detail for formal analyses. Grade 3-4 cardiotoxicity, fever/infection, neurological toxicity, stomatatis/mucositis and renal/genitourinary toxicity were reported less frequently or for fewer trials, possibly as their occurrence depends on the individual drugs being given. Thus formal analyses of these types of toxicity would be unreliable and were not completed.</P>
<P>Across all trials, serious nausea and vomiting more than doubled with the more-intense regimens compared with less-intense chemotherapies (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.71 to 4.09; P &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). While the results appeared fairly consistent across all trials (heterogeneity P = 0.21; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 32%), they did vary between the trial subgroups. For diarrhoea/other GI toxicities, although there were few grade 3 or 4 events overall (n = 31), there seemed to be an excess with more chemotherapy compared to less chemotherapy (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.09 to 4.63; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results for serious white blood cell toxicities (including leukopenia, neutropenia and granulocytopenia) were much more variable from trial to trial (heterogeneity P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 89%), and by trial subgroup (test for interaction P &lt; 0.00001) such that it did not seem reasonable to pool these results using either a fixed- or a random-effects model (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The effects of more chemotherapy on serious thrombocytopenia were similarly varied between trials (heterogeneity P &lt; 0.00001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%) and subgroups (test for interaction P &lt; 0.0001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) and so results across all trials were not pooled.</P>
<P>Although based on data from only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 2004</LINK>; total number of events 35), serious anaemia was increased (OR 5.32; 95% CI 2.62 to 10.81; P &lt; 0.0001) with more chemotherapy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Serious alopecia was also increased with more chemotherapy (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.01 to 3.42; P = 0.05; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>); however, this is based on data from only two trials and the events were dominated by one of those trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aapro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aapro 2003</LINK>) that compared doxorubicin alone and in combination.</P>
<P>Across all trials, 19 patients were reported to have died owing to treatment-related toxicity; however, not all trials reports whether these deaths were in the more or less chemotherapy arms. In addition, a number of trials reported that toxicity was a factor that led to protocol violations or discontinuation of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1984</LINK> stated that 35/107 patients with serious haematological toxicity had protocol violations; <LINK REF="STD-Aapro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aapro 2003</LINK> reported that 10% of patients receiving more chemotherapy and 2% of those receiving less chemotherapy stopped treatment due to "extensive toxicity" and <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004a</LINK> reported that 32/134 patients (24%) receiving more chemotherapy and 12/129 patients (9%) receiving less chemotherapy discontinued treatment due to toxicity.</P>

<P>Overall, the trials included in this comparison tended to be well balanced with respect to well-known prognostic factors such as age, stage and performance status with median age across all studies ranging from 61 to 66 years (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004b</LINK>) reported that patients were not well balanced by age. There were no significant differences reported between the treatment arms for any of the trials in terms of objective response rates and both the median OS and PFS times were also similar between the treatment arms for all of the trials (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). For one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2003</LINK>) insufficient outcome data were available for formal analyses of any of the outcomes.</P>
<P>For the three remaining trials in this comparison, there was no evidence that any of the treatment comparisons made differed in terms of either OS (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) or PFS (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Because the treatment comparisons being made between the studies varied widely in terms of the chemotherapy doublets being investigated, no overall effect was calculated.</P>
<P>Acute toxicity was assessed using GOG criteria for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallion-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gallion 2003</LINK>) and using NCU CTC version 2 for one further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nomura-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Nomura 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nomura-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Nomura 2010b</LINK>). All three trials reported that the major toxicities in both arms were haematological (leukopenia or granulocytopenia). In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nomura-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Nomura 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nomura-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Nomura 2010b</LINK>), while the rates of grade 3 to 4 haematological toxicity were in excess of 70% overall, there was no significant difference between the treatment arms. In the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gallion-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gallion 2003</LINK>), rates were similarly high (&gt; 70% overall); however, there was a significant difference in the rates of both leukopenia (P = 0.01) and granulocytopenia (P = 0.04) that favoured the circadian treatment schedule.</P>
<P>The most common serious non-haematological toxicity for all three trials was gastrointestinal toxicity. <LINK REF="STD-Gallion-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gallion 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nomura-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Nomura 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nomura-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Nomura 2010b</LINK> reported levels of nausea and vomiting of 14% and 9% overall (respectively) and <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004b</LINK> reported rates for all grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal symptoms of 14%. No significant differences were reported between the treatment arms for any of the studies.</P>
<P>Across all four trials in this comparison, 17 patients were reported to have died due to treatment-related toxicity, most commonly due to renal failure (four deaths) and sepsis (seven deaths). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2004b</LINK> reported that 48 patients (30% of the total randomised) stopped treatment due to toxicity although the numbers stopping treatment were very similar on the two treatment arms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: trials comparing different single agents</HEADING>
<P>This comparison includes two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Horton-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pawinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pawinski 1999</LINK>) that compared different single-agent chemotherapy regimens (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). However, data for inclusion in this meta-analysis were only available for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pawinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pawinski 1999</LINK>) that randomised only 74 patients. There was no evidence of a difference in terms of OS (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) or PFS (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) between the treatment arms. The most commonly reported serious toxicities for this trial were nausea and vomiting, and alopecia. Grade 3 nausea and vomiting was reported for 20 patients (27%) overall, with no difference between the treatment arms. Grade 3 alopecia was reported for 12 patients (16% of the total randomised) receiving ifosfamide and six patients (8% of the total randomised) receiving cyclophosphamide.</P>
<P>No deaths were reported as being due to treatment-related toxicity for either trial; however, toxicity was cited as the reason that three patients discontinued treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pawinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pawinski 1999</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:55:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our searches identified 14 RCTs, randomising 2525 women, of cytotoxic chemotherapy in advanced or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma. The apparent quality of these trials based largely on the trial reports was variable. For example, it is not known how randomisation occurred in a number of the studies and the method of concealment of allocation generally was not reported. Three trials randomised fewer than 50 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horton-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>) and so would only be sufficiently powered to detect a very large difference in the effectiveness between the two arms. Two studies were stopped prematurely (<LINK REF="STD-Aapro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aapro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Aapro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aapro 2003</LINK> cited a dramatic fall in recruitment after the publication results of <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 2004</LINK> in abstract form as the reason for early termination. Long 1995 stopped early after only accruing 28 patients, at a slow rate. Furthermore, some trials excluded relatively large numbers of patients after randomisation such that analyses were not always on an "intention-to-treat" basis. Therefore, the possibility of some bias in the estimates of treatment effect cannot be ruled out. Trials were grouped into three main comparisons according to the broad comparisons made. The majority (8 trials, 1571 women) compared more versus less chemotherapy and this review largely focused on the results of this comparison.</P>
<P>Across the eight trials comparing more- versus less-intense chemotherapy, the results for both OS and PFS were consistent across the trial groups and in favour of the more-intensive chemotherapy regimens. As the control arms for some of these trials are the comparators for others, it is not possible from these results to recommend a particular regimen. However, in terms of survival and PFS, three or more drug combinations including doxorubicin and cisplatin seemed better than the two-drug combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin, which in turn appeared to improve upon single-agent doxorubicin chemotherapy. However, more chemotherapy was generally associated with increased rates of serious acute toxicities, most commonly haematological and gastrointestinal. Survival benefits should therefore be considered alongside these increases in toxicity, in particular as advanced endometrial cancer tends to affect more elderly women often with other co-morbidities. While two trials reported increases in alopecia, as may be expected with doxorubicin-based regimens, there was a lack of alopecia data reported in trials using paclitaxel-containing regimens, where alopecia may also be expected to be common.</P>
<P>The data does not allow any conclusions to be made about which patients may potentially gain the greatest benefits from chemotherapy. The randomised trials enrolled a heterogeneous group of patients in terms of prior therapies, which included hormonal agents, radiotherapy and cytotoxic agents, may have impacted on the response to chemotherapy in this advanced setting. The trials also included patients with both advanced and recurrent disease and there may be differences between these patient groups in terms of how well they respond to treatments. These and other factors including performance status and other co-morbidities may impact on how much benefit a patient obtains from treatment as well as how they tolerate more-intensive chemotherapy. There are no data regarding correlation between sites of metastatic disease and benefit (e.g. any metastases versus visceral metastases). There is therefore little evidence base from randomised studies to help guide initial choice of therapy, be it endocrine, chemotherapy or best supportive care.</P>
<P>There was no good evidence from the RCTs comparing other chemotherapy regimens or scheduling, that any were superior in terms of improved survival and PFS and/or reduced toxicity; however, insufficient data and inconsistent 'control' arm treatments between the trials comparing different two-drug combinations makes any conclusion difficult. Moreover, these modestly sized trials are unlikely to be adequately powered to discriminate between the treatment arms. Only two trials compared single-agent chemotherapies and these are possibly now outdated. While traditionally, doxorubicin has been the most common drug used in the treatment of endometrial cancer, more recently, paclitaxel and carboplatin have become more widely used, possibly as a result of their routine use in the treatment of ovarian and, increasingly, cervical cancer. Results of one of the currently active trials (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00063999" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00063999</LINK>) may help to determine whether this two-drug combination improves on doxorubicin-based treatment for women with advanced endometrial cancer.</P>
<P>As no QoL data were collected or reported in any of the trials, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential of chemotherapy to palliate symptoms and improve QoL, although these are clearly important priorities for both patients and clinicians. Given the modest impact of chemotherapy on PFS and OS, collection of such patient-reported data must be a priority in future research. Reduction in tumour volume may lead to symptomatic benefit, but because such gains may be offset by treatment-related toxicity from treatment, it is sensible to try to assess effects on QoL in a systematic way in trials of palliative therapy. Reproducible scoring systems are available for assessing both symptoms and global QoL. Trials in other tumour types such as non-small cell lung cancer have used such scoring systems and demonstrated significant improvements in QoL, even where survival benefits were small (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>More-intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, with drugs including cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin and taxanes may improve OS and PFS in women with advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma. However, the optimal treatment regimen is still unclear and benefits are at the expense of increased acute toxicity. These issues should be discussed with patients before they consent to chemotherapy and where possible, patients should be offered entry into well-designed RCTs of treatment.</P>
<P>No single-agent or combination chemotherapy stands out. However, our results suggest the combination of up to three drugs, including doxorubicin, may be a reasonable choice. Two active studies identified in our searches (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00052312" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00052312</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00063999" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00063999</LINK>) are evaluating the use of the three-drug combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin and paclitaxel, albeit that the comparators differ between the two studies, with one using doxorubicin and cisplatin (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00052312" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00052312</LINK>) and the other using paclitaxel and carboplatin (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00063999" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00063999</LINK>). Results of these two studies, once available, may help to define an optimal treatment regimen for women with advanced disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-25 10:56:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the involvement of over 2500 women in randomised trials, basic questions have not been answered. While the results of this review demonstrate improvements in survival and PFS with some of the more-intensive chemotherapy regimens in women with advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma, there may remain a need to randomise women with advanced, recurrent and metastatic disease to receive chemotherapy, hormone therapy or best supportive care and to assessment properly the impact of treatment within subgroups of patients defined by the stage or extent of disease, prior treatments and baseline characteristics that may influence the response to treatment. In this way, patients most likely to benefit may be defined thus reducing unnecessary harms and side effects for those women less likely to benefit. Furthermore, QoL and symptom scores should supplement outcomes such as response, progression and OS.</P>
