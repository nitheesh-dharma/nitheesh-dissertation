<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-30 05:51:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. A severe form is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Birth control pills with the hormones progestin and estrogen have been studied for treating such symptoms. A birth control pill with the progestin drospirenone may work better than other such pills. A drospirenone pill with low estrogen was approved for treating PMDD, the severe form of PMS, in women who use birth control pills.</P>
<P>We did a computer search for trials that compared a birth control pill containing drospirenone and estrogen to a placebo ('dummy') or another birth control pill in treating premenstrual symptoms. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We looked at whether the pills reduced symptoms and if side effects were reported. Women recorded their symptoms over time.</P>
<P>We found five trials with 1920 women. Two trials compared a dummy pill to a drospirenone pill with low estrogen. All the women had PMDD, the severe form of PMS, before the trial. After three months, women on the drospirenone pill with low estrogen had less severe premenstrual symptoms than the group taking the dummy pill. Women in the drospirenone group said they could do more and had more social activities and friends. Women on the drospirenone pill had more nausea, bleeding between periods, and breast pain. These side effects are common with birth control pills. Three trials studied a drospirenone pill with more estrogen for treating less severe symptoms. These women did not all have PMDD. One compared the drospirenone pill to a dummy pill but did not have enough data for our review. Two compared the study pill to another birth control pill. The two-year study showed the groups were similar for premenstrual symptoms and side effects. The six-month study did not give enough data on the symptoms.</P>
<P>A drospirenone pill with low estrogen seems to help premenstrual symptoms in women with severe symptoms (PMDD). The drospirenone pill worked a little better than the dummy pill, which also affected symptoms. We do not know if the birth control pill works longer than three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other birth control pills. Longer and better studies with more women are needed to address these issues. Trials reports should be clearer about how the study was done.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-21 08:49:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives, which provide both progestin and estrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. An oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and a low estrogen dose has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose oral contraceptives for contraception.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-12-21 09:37:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review all randomized controlled trials comparing a combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone to a placebo or another combined oral contraceptive for effect on premenstrual symptoms.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-21 09:08:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for studies of drospirenone and premenstrual syndrome in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, and POPLINE (20 Dec 2011); EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health Organization (02 Mar 2011). We also examined references lists of relevant articles and wrote to known investigators to find other trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-12-21 09:36:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing drospirenone with a placebo or with another COC for effect on premenstrual symptoms. The primary outcome included affective and physical premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded. Adverse events related to combined oral contraceptive use were examined.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-12-30 05:27:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-31 02:49:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five trials with a total of 1920 women. Two placebo-controlled trials of women with PMDD showed less severe premenstrual symptoms after three months with drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 &#956;g than with placebo (MD -7.92; 95% CI -11.16 to -4.67). The drospirenone group had greater mean decreases in impairment of productivity (MD -0.31; 95% CI -0.55 to -0.08), social activities (MD -0.29; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.04), and relationships (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). Side effects more common with the use of the drospirenone COC contraceptive were nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and breast pain. The respective odds ratios were 3.15 (95% CI 1.90 to 5.22), 4.92 (95% CI 3.03 to 7.96), and 2.67 (95% CI 1.50 to 4.78). Total adverse events related to the study drug were more likely for the drospirenone COC group (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.44). Three trials studied the effect of drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 &#956;g on less severe symptoms. A placebo-controlled six-month trial had insufficient data for primary outcome analysis. Another six-month study used levonorgestrel 150 µg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 µg for the comparison group but did not provide enough data on premenstrual symptoms. In a two-year trial, the drospirenone COC group had similar premenstrual symptoms to the comparison group given desogestrel 150 µg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 µg (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22). The groups were also similar for adverse events related to treatment (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.33).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-12-21 09:39:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 &#956;g may help treat premenstrual symptoms in women with severe symptoms, that is, premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The placebo also had a large effect. We do not know whether the combined oral contraceptive works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other oral contraceptives. Larger and longer trials of higher quality are needed to address these issues. Trials should follow CONSORT guidelines.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-12-30 05:55:02 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem with different levels of severity. Criteria for PMS were developed in the 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>). Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is considered to be a severe form of PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 2006</LINK>). Estimates for prevalence are shown below by severity level (<LINK REF="REF-Foidart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foidart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Premenstrual symptoms: may occur in more than 75% of menstruating women.</LI>
<LI>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS): 20% to 40% of women may experience PMS, which involves symptoms that are bothersome and meet defined criteria.</LI>
<LI>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): 3% to 8% of menstruating women may have PMDD or substantial impairment of daily activity due to severe symptoms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The terminology can be confusing as researchers also use the broader term PMS to describe severe symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>PMS and PMDD differ in severity; the types of symptoms are the same. For diagnosis and evaluation of PMS, the guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) include medical and psychological history, physical examination, and prospective symptom diaries or calendars to confirm the timing of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>). Symptoms must be consistent with PMS, occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and be associated with some impairment of daily activity. <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK> recommends reviewing two to three months of prospectively recorded symptoms rather than a single cycle, due to variability from cycle to cycle. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of PMS, has research diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). A diagnosis of PMDD requires the prospective recording and presence of both affective (mood or emotional) and somatic (physical) symptoms. The woman must have at least five symptoms, including a mood problem, as well as impairment in an activity of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>). For both PMS and PMDD, premenstrual symptoms are relieved or disappear shortly after the onset of menses. In this review, we use the term PMDD when the DSM-IV criteria are specified. Otherwise, we use the term PMS when appropriate or premenstrual symptoms when no diagnosis was apparent.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-12-30 07:32:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), containing both progestin and estrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve PMS or PMDD (<LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 2003</LINK>). Most COCs on the market are derived from 19-nor testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Kurshan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurshan 2006</LINK>). Side effects from these COCs may include symptoms similar to those of PMS, such as water retention, appetite changes, and depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Kroll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2005</LINK>). A newer progestin, drospirenone, is derived from spironolactone rather than 19-nor testosterone. Consequently, drospirenone is considered to be an antimineralocorticoid progestin (<LINK REF="REF-Oelkers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oelkers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitruk_x002d_Ware-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitruk-Ware 2005</LINK>) that may influence fluid balance. Oral contraceptives with drospirenone reportedly produce fewer side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Foidart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foidart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurshan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurshan 2006</LINK>), and emphasis has been placed on less weight gain with a drospirenone COC (<LINK REF="REF-Foidart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foidart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oelkers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oelkers 2004</LINK>). However, a Cochrane review did not find a major effect on weight due to combination contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 2011</LINK>). In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a COC containing drospirenone for treating PMDD (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK>). This approval permits the manufacturer to make claims about the drug's effectiveness in treating PMDD. However, the product label notes that effectiveness after three cycles is unknown.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-12-21 09:54:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Despite improved diagnostic criteria, mechanisms for PMS or PMDD have not yet been clarified (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurshan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurshan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2006</LINK>). The number and range of PMS symptoms complicate research in this area. Examples of affective symptoms are depression, anxiety, and irritability (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 2003</LINK>). Somatic symptoms include breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, headache, and change in appetite. Possible mechanisms include hormonal influences on the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Winer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2006</LINK>), and mood symptoms may reflect hormonal changes (<LINK REF="REF-Kurshan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurshan 2006</LINK>). From a randomized crossover trial, <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1998</LINK> reported that women with PMS had an abnormal response to normal concentrations of gonadal steroids. Current research areas include neurotransmitters, especially serotonin and &#978;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which can affect mood and behavior (<LINK REF="REF-Kurshan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurshan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paoletti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoletti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2006</LINK>). Psychosocial issues may also have a role in premenstrual syndrome. From interviews with women seeking treatment for PMS, <LINK REF="REF-Golding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 2000</LINK> found a large proportion with a history of sexual abuse, especially during childhood or adolescence. The authors estimated that many of these women had post-traumatic stress disorder. In another observational study, <LINK REF="REF-Haywood-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 2007</LINK> found that PMS was associated with the personality characteristic of perfectionism and a low level of maternal social support.</P>
<P>Moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms are often treated with drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Kroll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 2006</LINK>). The pharmacologic therapies considered most effective for premenstrual symptoms are selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), especially fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 2006</LINK>). These SSRIs have been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but their effectiveness is unknown beyond three to six months. Also under investigation is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which helps regulate fluid balance (<LINK REF="REF-Oelkers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oelkers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2006</LINK>). Spironolactone, with its antimineralocorticoid activity, influences the RAAS and leads to increased fluid excretion. Spironolactone has been shown to reduce PMS symptoms in randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1995</LINK>). A Cochrane review examined the utility of progesterone in treating PMS and found very little good quality evidence of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-pharmacologic therapies for treating PMS and PMDD include lifestyle changes, dietary modification or supplementation, and cognitive behavior therapy (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 2006</LINK>). In an RCT, <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK> examined the effect of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), fluoxetine, and a combination of the two. The researchers found CBT and fluoxetine to be equally effective in improving scores on the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences (COPE). Combining the treatments provided no advantage (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK>). From a small RCT, <LINK REF="REF-Blake-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 1998</LINK> found that cognitive therapy resulted in improvements in several measures related to PMS, such as impairment scales. Other non-pharmacologic therapies have limited evidence of effectiveness due to small uncontrolled or non-randomized trials.</P>

<P>The primary outcome included affective and physical premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded. Emphasis was placed on assessment with instruments tested for reliability or validity. Most of the assessment tools had been tested for their psychometric properties, particularly reliability and validity. In this context, reliability generally refers to test-retest or internal consistency. For validity, the tools were examined for concurrence with other accepted scales or rating systems. If no data were available from such instruments, we used results from diaries of recorded symptoms.</P>
<P>Measures for the primary outcome included the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Daily Record of Severity of Problems was developed for diagnosing and evaluating PMDD, and has been tested for its psychometric properties (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 2006</LINK>). This instrument was studied in a general sample of women and a larger group of women screened for PMDD. The Daily Record was assessed for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and correlations with other measures of severity (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 2006</LINK>). The Daily Record includes 21 items that address 11 symptoms, in addition to 3 items on functional impairment.</LI>
<LI>Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences (COPE) was developed for assessing premenstrual issues and was tested among women screened for PMS as well as controls. The COPE was examined for test-retest reliability and its validity for assessing PMS symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Mortola-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortola 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Haywood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 2002</LINK> reviewed the instrument's development and psychometric properties.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Moos-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moos 1968</LINK>) was originally normed on a homogeneous sample of young women, which may limit its generalizability. In addition, the MDQ was tested via retrospective recording (<LINK REF="REF-Moos-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moos 1968</LINK>) that may overestimate symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2003</LINK>). The MDQ has been widely used and reportedly reflects menstrual symptoms, although in statistical analysis some symptoms load on (or group with) more than one factor (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2003</LINK>). Some detail on the development and psychometric properties of the MDQ can be found in <LINK REF="REF-Haywood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 2002</LINK>. The MDQ has two forms (<LINK REF="REF-Moos-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moos 2011</LINK>). The first is Form C (Cycle), which a woman can use to report her experience during the most recent cycle, that is, retrospectively; this form is useful for screening. Form T (Today) allows for completion on a specific day. A profile based on repeated use of Form T is considered necessary to identify cyclical changes. We did not find any studies that used Form T. At least two trials used Form C, so those data were not included in this review.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2011-12-30 06:44:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Secondary outcomes included mood scores measured with instruments not developed for assessing premenstrual symptoms. These tools were the widely used Beck Depression Index and Profile of Mood States, as well as the Endicott Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q was originally developed to assess several areas of daily functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 1993</LINK>). Since the Q-LES-Q was examined for its reliability and validity in persons with depression, it may not be as useful in women with PMS.</P>
<P>Also included were outcomes defined as secondary by the researchers. The Premenstrual Tension Scale (PMTS) was derived from the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire described above (<LINK REF="REF-Moos-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moos 1968</LINK>). The PMTS has been assessed for validity but not for reliability (<LINK REF="REF-Haywood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 2002</LINK>). However, the PMTS is considered more acceptable for prospective recording than the full MDQ (<LINK REF="REF-Connolly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events (AEs) were also examined in this review. The AEs included, but were not limited to, events commonly related to oral contraceptives, namely intermenstrual bleeding, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and breast tenderness. Headache and breast tenderness can also be premenstrual symptoms and are included in this review as reported by the trial authors. Rare but serious AEs such as venous thromboembolism were examined when provided in the reports. AEs that were not likely to be related to COC use, or had very low incidence and no difference between groups, are only mentioned in the text.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-09-23 20:36:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. RevMan uses the inverse variance approach (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The measures included mean scores for the assessment of premenstrual symptoms or change in the mean scores for such symptoms. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated. An example is the proportion of women with any premenstrual symptom or adverse event. The Peto OR is useful when treatment effects are small and when events are not very common (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This approach performs well under many circumstances, except when the study arms are severely unbalanced, which rarely occurs in RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001a</LINK>). In addition, the Peto OR does not require correction for zero events, which can occur when events are rare, such as for adverse events.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.1 Daily Rating of Problem Severity</HEADING>
<P>Two studies used this measure (<LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>). The mean daily rating of problem severity was lower for the drospirenone 3 mg plus EE 20 &#956;g group compared to the placebo group for cycles one to three (mean difference -7.92; 95% CI -11.16 to -4.67; 514 participants, 2 trials) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Therefore, the treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK> had more 'responders' with 50% or greater decrease in the daily symptom score (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40; 450 participants, 1 trial) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The response was 48% of the treated group and 36% of the placebo group, which yielded an incremental treatment effect of 12%. Using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001b</LINK>, the number needed to treat for a response was estimated to be eight women, as <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK> reported.

The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> had diary cards for daily recording of specific symptoms and bleeding. The report provided results for symptoms during the menstrual phase and noted that symptoms were more common and more intense during that time.

<P>The two studies reported on adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-Foidart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foidart 2000</LINK> provided data on total AEs as well as AEs related to treatment that affected more than 1% of the women. Results for individual AEs were correlated with those for total AEs since they were a subset. The study groups were similar for these AEs (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) as well as for the incidence of spotting (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) or breakthrough bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) (per woman or per cycle). This one trial had 900 participants. <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> reported selected AE results in the text as percentages. Back-calculations produced denominators that were inconsistent with the sample sizes shown in the participant flow chart. Therefore, the AE data were not used here. Severe adverse events totaled 17, and were reportedly similar for the two groups. The researchers noted the drospirenone COC group had one bilateral deep vein thrombosis and one case of a migraine.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-30 07:31:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>, the participants were previously diagnosed with PMDD, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). After treatment, the overall premenstrual symptoms were less severe for women assigned to the drospirenone COC (containing EE 20 &#956;g) than for the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>). The treatment group had greater reported improvements in productivity, social activities, and relationships. These outcomes were measured with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems, which was developed for evaluating PMDD (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 2006</LINK>). The drospirenone COC group also had more favorable results on a secondary outcome, the Premenstrual Tension Scales (observer-rated and self-rated), derived from the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Connolly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moos-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moos 1968</LINK>). Side effects more common with the use of the drospirenone COC were nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and breast pain; these are typically related to COC use. </P>
<P>Two meta-analyses for <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK> showed some heterogeneity; these were for impairment of social activities and for the self-rated Premenstrual Tension Scale. While the study groups in both trials differed in the same direction, the estimates for both these outcomes were much larger for <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK>, but the 95% CIs were wider. Further, the improvements (that is, decreases) were greater for the COC-first group in the crossover trial of <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK>. Within the COC-first group, the non-completers had a higher baseline mean for the Daily Record than the completers, which indicates they had more severe symptoms at baseline. However, the completers in <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK> may have differed from the completers in <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>Interpretation of the number needed to treat differs when a powerful placebo effect is evident, such as the 43% placebo response reported in <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2001</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>, 36% of participants given placebo met the criteria for 'responders' in contrast to 48% of the women given the drospirenone COC. When compared to the placebo, the COC would require eight women to be treated to benefit one. However, compared to no therapy (and assuming no response to no therapy), the number needed to treat would be three for placebo and two for the drospirenone COC. While the COC protects against pregnancy, the placebo would be less expensive for treating PMS and has fewer side effects than the active pill.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Foidart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foidart 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> compared a drospirenone COC (containing EE 30 &#956;g) with another COC. The women did not necessarily have a previous diagnosis of PMS or PMDD. The study groups in <LINK REF="STD-Foidart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foidart 2000</LINK> were similar at cycle 26 for premenstrual symptoms and adverse events. Lack of an effect may have been related to the longer trial length. Side effects of hormonal contraceptives, such as bleeding problems, often dissipate over time. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Foidart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foidart 2000</LINK> included both new OC users and women switching from other OCs, which might have mitigated a potential effect.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-12-30 07:31:59 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a COC containing drospirenone (plus EE 20 &#956;g) for treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in women who choose oral contraceptives (OCs) for contraception (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK>). The approval does not mention PMS, just the more severe PMDD. The regimen for this COC is 24 days of active pills followed by 4 days of inert pills rather than the more common pattern of 21 and 7 days. FDA approval gives the manufacturer permission to make claims about the effectiveness of the pill. However, the approved label notes that effectiveness after three cycles is unknown. Most of the available evidence comes from two placebo-controlled trials with three-month treatment duration, namely <LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>. Losses to follow up in those trials were 64% and 27%, respectively. Gallo 2011 found higher rates of early trial discontinuation with COCs containing EE 20 &#956;g compared to COCs with higher estrogen. The drospirenone COC containing EE 30 &#956;g does not have FDA approval for treatment of PMDD (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK>). Many of the results for <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> could not be used for analysis in this review due to lack of data in the reports.</P>
<P>We summarized the available evidence by condition and intervention (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). No study examined women with premenstrual syndrome that was less severe than PMDD. Therefore, we cannot determine whether an OC containing drospirenone might affect PMS. Further, the drospirenone COC with EE 20 &#956;g has not yet been compared to another contraceptive, as the drospirenone COC with EE 30 &#956;g had been.</P>
<P>A 'Summary of findings' table was not feasible for this review. Of five studies, only two could be included in a meta-analysis. A 'Summary of findings' table would selectively present data from those two trials. Further, the 'Summary of findings' table requests 'risk of event' for low, medium, and high risk groups, which is less relevant for premenstrual syndrome than for a condition such as heart disease.</P>
<P>We were able to obtain additional data from the sponsor for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pearlstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2005</LINK>) but not from others with insufficient data reported (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2001</LINK>, results for Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences were presented in figures, so no data were available for analysis. Also, adverse events were presented as percentages without absolute numbers. For <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK>, we were unable to obtain the premenstrual phase data from the daily diaries. <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> also reported adverse events as percentages.

The low quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Foidart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foidart 2000</LINK>) showed the study groups to be similar, so the results were not re-examined by study quality.</P>
<P>In this review, interpretation of results was limited by several factors. Different instruments were used across trials. While the types of symptoms assessed overlapped, the number and structure of the items differed, as did the analysis. Some sample sizes were relatively small. Losses to follow up were generally high, especially given the short duration of most trials. Four of the five trials had losses greater than 20%, which can bias the results (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials appeared to exclude from the primary analysis women who did not receive the study drug. The denominators were unclear for a study that withdrew women due to protocol deviations. These practices are not consistent with an intention-to-treat analysis and can lead to biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>All of the trials were relatively recent yet they did not follow CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Design details were lacking in the reports. In addition, CONSORT recommends the reporting of outcome data in absolute numbers rather than percentages. Two trials reported outcomes as percentages or in figures, which prevented the inclusion of those data in the review.</P>

<P>As noted in <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>, we were unable to obtain any information beyond the protocol for a trial planned for 1995. If the trial had been implemented, and a positive effect found, the sponsor and manufacturer of the COC would likely have shared the results. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> collected daily symptoms from participants. However, the sponsor (and manufacturer of the COC) communicated that they could not provide data from the premenstrual phase. The report included data from the luteal phase, as noted in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. If the COC had shown an effect for the premenstrual phase, the manufacturer would probably want to share that information. The same company produces the COC that is marketed for treating PMDD. Consequently, negative results are likely to be under-reported in this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-12-30 07:24:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recent reviews of drospirenone-containing contraceptives for treatment of premenstrual symptoms depend on the trials included in this review. However, most reviews still include studies of various designs, while this review was limited to randomized controlled trials. In addition, some authors may distinguish between PMDD and PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Breech-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breech 2009</LINK>) and others may not (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2010</LINK>). Consequently, readers may not be clear about whether the therapy is useful for all women with PMS or just for those with the severe form (PMDD). In our review, significant differences regarding premenstrual symptoms apply to PMDD. <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2010</LINK> notes that studies have shown few effects of oral contraceptives on PMS. However, when presenting the evidence for OCs treating PMDD, <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2010</LINK> does not mention the limited timeframe of three months.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-12-30 07:26:42 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drospirenone with EE 20 &#956;g COC may help treat premenstrual symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). However, a powerful placebo effect was evident: in one trial, symptoms were reduced for 48% of the drospirenone COC group versus 36% of the placebo group. The difference may not be clinically significant. Furthermore, effectiveness after three cycles is unknown. Little evidence exists for treating less severe symptoms and on whether a drospirenone COC works any better than other COCs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomized controlled trials should follow CONSORT reporting guidelines. Larger trials of higher quality and longer duration are needed to address whether the drospirenone COC with EE 20 &#956;g is effective over time in treating premenstrual symptoms. Higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of the results. Use of the same instruments for assessing premenstrual symptoms would improve the knowledge base in this area.</P>

<P>For the Initial review, published in 2008, two sets of search strategies were used. One was developed by the Search Coordinator for the Fertility Regulation Group (C Manion) in early October 2006. The other was provided by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (via J Clarke) in late 2006 and updated in July 2007. The strategies are shown below.</P>
