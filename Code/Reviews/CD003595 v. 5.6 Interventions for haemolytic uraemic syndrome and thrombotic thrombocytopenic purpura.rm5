<P>Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are related conditions with similar clinical features of variable severity. Survival of patients with HUS and TTP has improved greatly over the past two decades with improved supportive care for patients with HUS and by the use of plasma exchange (PE) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for patients with TTP. Separate pathogenesis of these two disorders has become more evident, but management overlaps.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of different interventions for HUS and TTP separately, in patients of all ages. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 08:56:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any interventions for HUS or TTP in patients of all ages. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 17:56:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors independently extracted data and evaluated study reporting quality using standard Cochrane criteria. Analysis was undertaken using a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 20:34:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For TTP, we found six RCTs (331 participants) evaluating PE with FFP as the control. Interventions tested included antiplatelet therapy (APT) plus PE with FFP, FFP transfusion and PE with cryosupernatant plasma (CSP). Two studies compared plasma infusion (PI) to PE with FFP and showed a significant increase in failure of remission at two weeks (RR 1.48, 95% 1.12 to 1.96) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.91, 95% 1.09 to 3.33) in the PI group. Seven RCTs were undertaken in children with HUS. None of the assessed interventions used (FFP transfusion, heparin with or without urokinase or dipyridamole, shiga toxin binding protein and steroids) were superior to supportive therapy alone, for all-cause mortality, neurological/extrarenal events, renal biopsy changes, proteinuria or hypertension at the last follow-up visit. Bleeding was significantly higher in those receiving anticoagulation therapy compared to supportive therapy alone (RR 25.89, 95% CI 3.67 to 182.83).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 20:31:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PE with FFP is still the most effective treatment available for TTP. For patients with HUS, supportive therapy including dialysis is still the most effective treatment. All studies in HUS have been conducted in the diarrhoeal form of the disease. There were no RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of any interventions on patients with atypical HUS who have a more chronic and relapsing course.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-05 08:58:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are related conditions with similar clinical features of variable severity. The clinical and pathologic features of TTP and HUS often overlap (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1995</LINK>), leading some to recommend the term "TTP-HUS". Although TTP and HUS can affect many of the same organ systems, the frequency with which they do so differs markedly, and the detailed histopathologic features of the lesions of TTP and HUS are distinct (<LINK REF="REF-Hosler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosler 2003</LINK>). Recent studies demonstrate that these disorders can be differentiated by the high incidence of severe deficiency of the VWF cleaving protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospodin) in patients with clinically diagnosed TTP (<LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 1998</LINK>), but not HUS.</P>
<P>ADAMTS13 levels are normal in some cases of idiopathic TTP and in almost all cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with stem cell or organ transplantation, cancer, infections, severe hypertension, and certain drugs. Therefore, mechanisms other than ADAMTS13 deficiency can cause TMA and various studies have implicated endothelial injury, platelet activation, and alterations in blood clotting as contributory factors. TTP occurs with an estimated annual incidence of 3.7 cases/million (<LINK REF="REF-Torok-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torok 1995</LINK>) and is more common in females (female/male ratio of 3:2) with a peak incidence occurring in the fourth decade (<LINK REF="REF-Vesely-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vesely 2003</LINK>). The mortality rate of TTP exceeds 90% without therapy. With the advent of plasma-based therapy there has been a dramatic improvement in the long-term survival, which now approaches 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Allford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allford 2003</LINK>). Two different forms of plasma therapy used, include plasma infusion (PI) (<LINK REF="REF-Byrnes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrnes 1977</LINK>) and plasma exchange (PE) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (<LINK REF="REF-Bukowski-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bukowski 1976</LINK>). Cryosupernatant PE (<LINK REF="REF-Rock-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rock 1996</LINK>) and solvent/detergent-treated PE (SDTP) have also been used in the treatment of some patients with TTP (<LINK REF="REF-Sacher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacher 1996</LINK>). Over the last few decades several other interventions including steroids, other immunosuppressants such as vincristine, antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents have been studied in patients with TTP with varying results.</P>
<P>HUS usually affects young children and has been classified in several ways, the most common type, the "typical" form is associated with diarrhoea due to infection with a Shiga toxin producing <I>Escherichia coli</I> or <I>Shigella dysenteriae</I>. This form of HUS accounts for at least 95% of all cases in children (<LINK REF="REF-Remuzzi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remuzzi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruggenenti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruggenenti 2001</LINK>) and may cause sporadic or epidemic disease. <I>E. coli</I> O157:H7 is the strain most commonly associated with HUS worldwide, however there is considerable geographic variation. Infection with Shiga toxin-producing organisms occasionally causes HUS in adults. The "atypical" forms of HUS, which may exhibit autosomal-dominant or recessive inheritance, are less common (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1992</LINK>). Some patients with a family history of HUS demonstrate persistently low levels of complement, caused by a homozygous deficiency of complement factor H (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2001</LINK>). Their disease runs a chronic, relapsing course, often complicated by hypertension and renal insufficiency and exacerbations may be precipitated by intercurrent illness.</P>
<P>The overall incidence of HUS in children aged less than five years ranges from 1.1 to 5.8/100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Decludt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decludt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milford-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milford 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1991</LINK>). Incidence has been estimated at 0.64/100,000 children aged less than 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2001</LINK>). The mortality rate ranges from 2.6% to 7.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2001</LINK>). Morbidity, in terms of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality is higher (23% and 22%, respectively) in atypical HUS than in diarrhoea-associated disease (<LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 1997</LINK>). Unlike children, adults with HUS due to <I>E. coli</I> 0157:H7 infection have high mortality rates, up to 86% in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Decludt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decludt 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical course of HUS appears to depend on cause and age. Children with post-diarrhoeal HUS generally do well provided appropriate care is given in a timely fashion. The mortality rate in this group has been reduced to 5% with appropriate supportive care which include blood transfusion, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, dialysis as required and control of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Banatvala-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banatvala 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Remuzzi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remuzzi 1995</LINK>). Despite a favourable short-term outcome, many children with Shiga-toxin associated HUS develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) over time. Other forms of therapy which have been tried over the past two decades in patients with HUS, include steroids, antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents, vitamin E, PI and PE.</P>
<P>The mainstay of treatment for HUS and TTP is supportive therapy and there is no consensus on the role of specific therapies, many of which have been proposed for these diseases. In this review we aim to identify interventions evaluated by RCT in patients with HUS and TTP and evaluate their effectiveness in respect to our clinical outcomes of interest including failure of remission, death and other severe complications, relapse, ESKD and persistent renal impairment.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:50:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For patients with TTP the principal outcome of interest was failure of response to therapy, defined as failure of remission at or less than two weeks and at one month. Other outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, and relapse rate during the follow up period (more than two months). For patients with HUS, the principal outcome of interest was all cause mortality. Other outcomes of interest included ESKD; renal biopsy changes (cortical necrosis, glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy and arterial thrombotic microangiopathy), persistent proteinuria, hypertension and CKD (glomerular filtration rate of &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m²) at the last follow-up. Other outcomes of interest in both groups of patients (TTP and HUS) were extra renal manifestations of disease. Adverse effects of treatment such as bleeding, opportunistic infections and allergic reactions to the intervention were also of interest.</P>
<P>The definition of response or remission rate was that defined by the study investigators. This was usually improvement of platelet count &gt; 150 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L for three consecutive days with or without resolution of haemolysis and normalisation of serum creatinine. Proteinuria was defined as the presence of &gt; 2+ protein on urinalysis or &gt; 4 mg/m²/h protein in a 24 hour urine sample. Hypertension was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure over 95th centile for the age and height.</P>

<P>From all included studies, three authors extracted data using a standardised form. Study date and place, participant characteristics, intervention (type of treatment, dose, duration, co-interventions), comparator and primary and secondary outcomes of interest were recorded. When appropriate, authors of primary studies were contacted for clarification of data and to obtain missing information. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved in discussion. When results of a study were published more than once, the most complete data were extracted from all sources and used in the analysis only once. For dichotomous outcomes, results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were pooled using a random effects model whenever appropriate, but the fixed effects model was also analysed to ensure robustness and susceptibility to outliers. Mean difference (MD) with 95% CI was used where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment. Statistical heterogeneity was analysed using the Cochran Q test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.1 used for statistical significance and I2 statistics with &gt;10% for statistical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

Nine studies compared different interventions in children with HUS and seven of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Loirat-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Loirat 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loirat-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loirat 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizzoni-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzoni 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trachtman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Trachtman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Damme_x002d_Lombaerts-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Van Damme-Lombaerts 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitacco-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Vitacco 1973</LINK>) was included. Two of the nine HUS studies identified were published only in an abstract form and excluded because insufficient outcome data were available (<LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Wiefel-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Wiefel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Characteristics of the population and intervention of included studies are presented in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Of six included studies on interventions for TTP (331 patients), <LINK REF="STD-Roethele-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roethele 2000</LINK> (35 patients) included patients with HUS or TTP (age 18 to 80 years) and insufficient data were provided to enable us to separate these groups. Because all patients included in this study were aged over 18 years, it is likely that most had TTP or atypical HUS, so this study was included with TTP studies for the purpose of this review. In all these six studies the main comparator (control) treatment was PE using FFP. In three studies (116 patients) PE with FFP was compared with CSP or cryoprecipitate poor plasma (CPP). In two studies (143 patients) PE with FFP was compared with FFP transfusion and in these studies both treatment and control groups also received antiplatelet therapy (APT), namely aspirin and dipyridamole. In one study (72 patients) effectiveness of APT was tested, the control group received PE with FFP plus steroid and the treatment group received with PE with FFP plus steroid plus APT for 15 days. The patients who responded by achieving remission from the APT group received ticlopidine for one year. For 5/6 studies the follow-up period was more than six months.</P>
<P>Of the 476 patients in the seven included studies evaluating interventions for HUS, most were young children with post-diarrhoeal (typical) HUS (&gt;70% in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Loirat-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loirat 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizzoni-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzoni 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Damme_x002d_Lombaerts-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Van Damme-Lombaerts 1988</LINK>), 100% in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trachtman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Trachtman 2003</LINK>), not reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Loirat-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Loirat 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitacco-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Vitacco 1973</LINK>). None of these studies reported outcomes separately for children with typical and atypical HUS. In all HUS studies supportive therapy plus a specific intervention (treatment group) was compared with supportive therapy alone (control group). Supportive therapy generally included control of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, use of dialysis if required, control of hypertension and blood transfusion as required. In five of the seven studies peritoneal dialysis (PD) was used when dialysis was indicated but in two studies the type of dialysis used was not specified. A range of interventions was studied, including heparin with or without urokinase or dipyridamole (three studies, 121 patients); FFP infusion (two studies, 111 patients); methylprednisolone (one study, 94 patients) and shiga-toxin binding agent called Synsorb-Pk (one study, 150 patients).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">TTP studies</HEADING>
<P>In all studies involving patients with TTP, PE with FFP was used as the control. Interventions tested included with CPP or CSP, PI and APT. Initially we used meta-analysis to compare any interventions with PE with FFP and found no significant difference between the treatment and control groups in failure of remission at one month (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> (4 studies, 140 patients): RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00); all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> (6 studies, 309 patients): RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.08); and relapse rate (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> (4 studies, 126 patients): RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.58). However, failure of remission at two weeks was significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group ( (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (4 studies, 264 patients): RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.74). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for most outcomes, which was expected considering the variety of interventions used. However there was no significant heterogeneity among the studies included in the meta-analysis for failure of remission at two weeks (X² = 2.34, P = 0.50; I² = 0%) and relapse rate (X² = 3.28, P = 0.35; I² = 9%). 
<BR/>

<BR/>Further meta-analysis was performed including only studies using the same interventions. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roethele-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roethele 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 2001</LINK>) (116 patients) compared the use of PE with CSP or CPP to PE with FFP. Failure of remission at two weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and one month (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) was reported only in one of these studies; all-cause mortality was reported for three studies (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>); and relapse rate was reported in two studies (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). There was no significant difference between PE with FFP and PE with CSP/CPP for any of the four outcomes of interest. There was no significant heterogeneity between the studies.</P>
<P>In two TTP studies (<LINK REF="STD-Henon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Henon 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>) (140 patients), PI with FFP plus APT was compared with PE with FFP plus APT. The failure of remission at &lt; 2 weeks was significantly higher in the PI group (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> (2 studies, 140 patients): RR 1.48, 95% 1.12 to 1.96). In addition, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the PI group (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK> (2 studies, 140 patients): RR 1.91, 95% 1.09 to 3.33). Failure of remission rate at one month (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK> (2 studies, 72 patients): RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.42) and relapse rate (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK> (2 studies, 99 patients): RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.15) was not significantly different between control and treatment groups. There was no significant heterogeneity between the studies for any of these reported outcomes.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bobbio_x002d_Pallavicini-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bobbio-Pallavicini 1997</LINK> the effect of APT was tested in patients with TTP. Aspirin and dipyridamole were used for 15 days and patients in the treatment arm who had gone into remission were then treated with ticlopidine for one year. Both the treatment and control groups received PE with FFP and steroid. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to failure of remission at 2 weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) or at one month (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>), or in all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>) and relapse rate (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Side effects of treatment were reported in only 2/6 TTP studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Bobbio_x002d_Pallavicini-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bobbio-Pallavicini 1997</LINK> which used APT, 4/35 patients from the APT arm had transient worsening of pre-existing bleeding but none of the nonbleeding patients experienced any bleeding. In addition, 2/32 patients from ticlopidine group developed severe erosive gastritis that resolved with medical treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Rock-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rock 1991</LINK>, which compared PI with PE, 6/51 patients in the PE group and 5/51 patients in PI group reported no complications. The remaining patients from both groups all experienced minor complications, including nausea, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnoea, dizziness, chills or oedema. In addition, eight of these had bleeding and four patients in each group had seizures during the procedure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">HUS studies</HEADING>
<P>In the studies, that included patients with HUS, supportive therapy (control group) was compared with a range of interventions including anticoagulation therapy, FFP infusion, steroid and a Shiga toxin binding agent. None of the tested interventions were superior to supportive therapy alone (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Loirat-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Loirat 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Damme_x002d_Lombaerts-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Van Damme-Lombaerts 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vitacco-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Vitacco 1973</LINK>) anticoagulation therapy was used (heparin alone in one study, heparin and urokinase in one study, and heparin and dipyridamole in one study. In all these studies the treatment and control groups received supportive therapy. There was no significant difference between the groups for any of the primary or secondary outcomes including all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>), neurological events (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>), renal biopsy changes (<LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>), proteinuria (<LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>) or hypertension (<LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>) at the last follow-up. However, the incidence of bleeding was significantly higher in the group that received anticoagulation therapy compared to supportive therapy alone (<LINK REF="CMP-006.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.8</LINK> (3 studies, 124 patients): RR 25.89, 95% CI 3.67 to 182.83). There was no heterogeneity between the studies for this outcome (X² = 0.02, I² = 0%). Nineteen (33%) of 58 children who received an anticoagulant but none of 66 children in the control group experienced bleeding.</P>
<P>Because 1/3 studies had no bleeding events, the relative frequency was not estimable. We therefore looked at risk difference (RD) to investigate the difference in event rates. When the random effects model was used there was no significant difference between the two groups (<LINK REF="CMP-006.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.9</LINK>: RD 0.44, 95% CI -0.39 to 1.28), however when we used the fixed effect model the difference was significant (<LINK REF="CMP-006.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.10</LINK>: RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.45). It is important to highlight these significant differences in bleeding rates between the two interventions under study, however, the imprecision caused by zero event rates and the significant heterogeneity (X² = 132.22, I² = 98%) should be considered when interpreting this result.</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Loirat-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loirat 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizzoni-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzoni 1988</LINK>) (117 patients) FFP infusion was compared with supportive therapy. There was no significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcomes of interest (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK> (94 patients) compared steroids with placebo and there was no significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcome measures of interest (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Trachtman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Trachtman 2003</LINK> compared shiga toxin binding agent (Synsorb-Pk) and placebo (145 patients) (comparison 09). There was no significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcome measures of interest (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-009.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-009.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-009.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.5</LINK>). Subgroup analysis performed according to study quality, year of the study (before and after 1990) and type of HUS (diarrhoea associated or typical versus atypical) did not demonstrate any differences in treatment effects for the outcome of all cause mortality in the HUS studies.</P>
<P>Side effects of treatment were reported in five studies. As reported above, rates of bleeding were significantly higher in patients receiving anticoagulation. In one study that compared supportive therapy plus steroid with supportive therapy and placebo, the number of cases of peritonitis was similar between groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Rizzoni-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzoni 1988</LINK>, which compared PI with supportive therapy, PI had to be stopped after seven days in one child due to cardiac overload. This study also reported non-A non-B hepatitis in two children from the control group but none from PI group.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 17:50:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the systematic review of the literature for RCTs evaluating interventions for HUS or TTP. We have shown that PE with FFP is more effective than FFP alone in patients with TTP and that other interventions provide no significant additional benefit over PE with FFP with regard to any of the outcomes of interest (failure of remission, all-cause mortality and relapse rate) from any of the interventions tested in RCTs (PE with CSP or CPP; PI and APT; or PE with FFP and APT).</P>
<P>PE with CSP or CPP in three studies conferred no advantage over PE with FFP for outcomes of interest. Although use of CSP may incur additional cost, none of the studies compared the difference in cost involved with the use of CSP or CPP as opposed to FFP. In one study, which used APT reported slightly increased risk of bleeding and gastritis in the APT group but no significant difference for any of the four outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>Based on the results of this systematic review, use of PE with FFP remains the primary treatment of choice for patients with TTP. Alternative therapies confer no additional benefit but increased risk. Some patients with TTP require prolonged PE to prevent a fatal outcome and to achieve a sustained remission. In these patients adjunct treatments including immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, high dose intravenous immunoglobulin, staphylococcal protein A, immunoadsorption or splenectomy have been used with variable results (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durand-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durand 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Udvardy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udvardy 1990</LINK>). However, we found no RCTs testing the effectiveness of any of these interventions. Use of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown promise in a small prospective cohort study in patients with acute refractory and severe relapsing TTP related to anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Fakhouri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhouri 2005</LINK>). The transfusion Medicine/Haemostasis (TMH) Clinical Trials Network from North America have initiated a RCT comparing the effectiveness of early use of rituximab versus placebo in addition to PE and glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-George-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>For HUS, we found that FFP, anticoagulation therapy, steroids and Shiga toxin binding agent confer no advantage over supportive therapy alone for any of the outcomes; all-cause mortality, neurological/extra renal events, ESRD, renal biopsy changes or proteinuria, and hypertension at the last follow-up. Adverse effects were reported in 5/7 included studies and bleeding was significantly higher with anticoagulation therapy in the three studies which compared its effectiveness. In the majority of the studies (5/7) peritoneal dialysis was used when dialysis was indicated. This contrasts with current practice in the majority of the North American centres where the preferred mode is haemodialysis or continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHD) for the management of acute kidney injury (<LINK REF="REF-Maxvold-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxvold 2003</LINK>). Our findings likely reflect the age of the studies included in the review, as 5/7 studies were published before 1990 and one before 2000.</P>
<P>It is important to note that in 5/7 HUS studies, included predominantly children with post-diarrhoeal HUS (&gt; 70% in three studies, 100% in two studies, not reported in two studies) and that no papers reported outcomes separately for children with diarrhoea-associated (typical) and atypical HUS. It has been suggested in the literature that atypical cases have a worse outcome. In two studies, in which FFP infusion was compared with supportive therapy, there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups for any of the outcomes of interest. However, the majority (&gt; 70%) of patients in both studies had post-diarrhoeal HUS, which usually remits with supportive therapy. The effectiveness of PE was tested in <LINK REF="STD-Muller_x002d_Wiefel-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Muller-Wiefel 1989</LINK>, which was not included in this systematic review as it was published only in an abstract form and data regarding outcomes of interest for this review were not available. This study failed to show any superior response on incidence of recurrence or ESKD in their small subset of high-risk patients.</P>
<P>Based on the results of this systematic review, supportive therapy (including blood transfusion, control of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, dialysis when indicated and control of hypertension) remains the preferred management for patients with post-diarrhoeal HUS. However, we identified only a small number of studies, many of them old and none comparing the effectiveness of different types of dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis or CVVHD) in patients with acute kidney injury due to HUS. We found no RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of any interventions including PI or PE in patients with atypical HUS, who may have a more chronic and relapsing course and present with features similar to TTP. Atypical HUS is not a homogeneous condition but has several different aetiologies and is a rare disease. Hence multicentre studies in well-characterised patients would be required to evaluate specific treatments.</P>
<P>Limitations of this review include the small number, suboptimal methodological quality and age of included studies, the possibility of publication bias, the small number of participants with atypical HUS, and the failure to separate atypical and typical HUS in recruitment and reporting of studies.</P>

<P>Results of this review suggest, for patients with TTP early use of PE with FFP remains as the primary treatment of choice and alternative therapies confer no additional benefit but increased risk. And for patients with HUS, supportive therapy including blood transfusion, control of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, dialysis when indicated and control of hypertension, remains as the primary treatment of choice. Majority of the studies used peritoneal dialysis (5/7 studies and 2/7 studies did not mention the type of dialysis used) when dialysis was indicated which might reflect the age of the studies as 5/7 studies were conducted before 1990. Hence there is no data to support the use of any one particular type of dialysis. As majority of the studies included diarrhoea positive HUS (typical HUS) patients and since we were unable to separate the data between the typical and atypical HUS, there is no data to suggest whether PI is useful in atypical HUS patients.</P>

<P>Studies to look at effectiveness of novel therapies may be needed to improve outcome for TTP and HUS. Especially RCTs that evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions including PI or PE in patients with atypical HUS, who may have a more chronic and relapsing course and present with features similar to TTP are needed. As atypical HUS is a rare disease, multicentre studies in well-characterised patients would be required to evaluate specific treatments.</P>
