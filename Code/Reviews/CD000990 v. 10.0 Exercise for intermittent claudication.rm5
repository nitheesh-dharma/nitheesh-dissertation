It is caused by inadequate blood flow to the leg muscles caused by atherosclerosis (fatty deposits restricting blood flow through the arteries). People with mild to moderate claudication are advised to keep walking, stop smoking, and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Other treatments include antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline or cilostazol, angioplasty (inserting a balloon into the artery to open it up), and bypass surgery.</P><P><B>Studies and key results</B></P><P>Review authors identified 32 controlled trials that randomised 1835 adults with stable leg pain to exercise, usual care or placebo, or other interventions (current until November 2016). Researchers measured outcomes at times ranging from two weeks to two years. Types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; in general, supervised sessions were held at least twice a week. The quality of included trials was moderate, mainly because of absence of relevant information. Ten trials reported that in the exercise groups, pain-free walking distance and the maximum distance that participants could walk was increased. Improvements were seen for up to two years. Exercise did not improve ankle to brachial blood pressure index. No evidence of an effect of exercise was seen on death or need for amputation because data were limited. Researchers assessed quality of life using the SF-36 Questionnaire at three and six months. At three months, indicators of quality of life - 'physical function', 'vitality', and 'role physical' - had all improved with exercise, but these data are limited, as only two trials reported this. Five studies reported improved 'physical summary score' and four studies reported improved 'mental health score' following exercise at six months, with two trials also reporting improvements in 'physical function' and 'general health'. All other domains showed no improvement at six months following exercise.</P><P>Comparisons of exercise with antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E, and pneumatic foot and calf compression were limited because numbers of identified trials and participants were small.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The present review shows that exercise programmes appear to improve walking distance for people considered fit for exercise regimens. This benefit appears to be sustained over two years. Evidence presented in this review was of moderate to high quality. Although differences between trials were evident, populations and outcomes were comparable overall, and findings were relevant to people with intermittent claudication. Combined results were derived from large sample sizes - over 300 participants for most outcomes - using reproducible methods.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:45:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:43:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other, more invasive therapies for treatment of leg pain on walking (intermittent claudication (IC)).

We included any exercise programme or regimen used for treatment of IC, such as walking, skipping, and running. Inclusion of trials was not affected by duration, frequency, or intensity of the exercise programme. Outcome measures collected included treadmill walking distance (time to onset of pain or pain-free walking distance and maximum walking time or maximum walking distance), ankle brachial index (ABI), quality of life, morbidity, or amputation; if none of these was reported, we did not include the trial in this review.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:44:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>For this update (2017), RAL and AH selected trials and extracted data independently. We assessed study quality by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed continuous data by determining mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and dichotomous data by determining risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model unless we identified significant heterogeneity, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:45:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included two new studies in this update and identified additional publications for previously included studies, bringing the total number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to 32, and involving a total of 1835 participants with stable leg pain. The follow-up period ranged from two weeks to two years. Types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; supervised sessions were generally held at least twice a week. Most trials used a treadmill walking test for one of the primary outcome measures. The methodological quality of included trials was moderate, mainly owing to absence of relevant information. Most trials were small and included 20 to 49 participants. Twenty-seven trials compared exercise versus usual care or placebo, and the five remaining trials compared exercise versus medication (pentoxifylline, iloprost, antiplatelet agents, and vitamin E) or pneumatic calf compression; we generally excluded people with various medical conditions or other pre-existing limitations to their exercise capacity.</P><P>Meta-analysis from nine studies with 391 participants showed overall improvement in pain-free walking distance in the exercise group compared with the no exercise group (MD 82.11 m, 95% CI 71.73 to 92.48, P &lt; 0.00001, high-quality evidence). Data also showed benefit from exercise in improved maximum walking distance (MD 120.36 m, 95% CI 50.79 to 189.92, P &lt; 0.0007, high-quality evidence), as revealed by pooling data from 10 studies with 500 participants. Improvements were seen for up to two years.</P><P>Exercise did not improve the ABI (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08, 13 trials, 570 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Limited data were available for the outcomes of mortality and amputation; trials provided no evidence of an effect of exercise, when compared with placebo or usual care, on mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.17, 5 trials, 540 participants, moderate-quality evidence) or amputation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15, 1 trial, 177 participants, low-quality evidence).</P><P>Researchers measured quality of life using Short Form (SF)-36 at three and six months. At three months, the domains 'physical function', 'vitality', and 'role physical' improved with exercise; however this was a limited finding, as it was reported by only two trials. At six months, meta-analysis showed improvement in 'physical summary score' (MD 2.15, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.04, P = 0.02, 5 trials, 429 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and in 'mental summary score' (MD 3.76, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.82, P &lt; 0.01, 4 trials, 343 participants, moderate-quality evidence) secondary to exercise. Two trials reported the remaining domains of the SF-36. Data showed improvements secondary to exercise in 'physical function' and 'general health'. The other domains - 'role physical', 'bodily pain', 'vitality', 'social', 'role emotional', and 'mental health' - did not show improvement at six months.</P><P>Evidence was generally limited in trials comparing exercise versus antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E, and pneumatic foot and calf compression owing to small numbers of trials and participants.</P><P>Review authors used GRADE to assess the evidence presented in this review and determined that quality was moderate to high. Although results showed significant heterogeneity between trials, populations and outcomes were comparable overall, with findings relevant to the claudicant population. Results were pooled for large sample sizes - over 300 participants for most outcomes - using reproducible methods.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:45:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>High-quality evidence shows that exercise programmes provided important benefit compared with placebo or usual care in improving both pain-free and maximum walking distance in people with leg pain from IC who were considered to be fit for exercise intervention. Exercise did not improve ABI, and we found no evidence of an effect of exercise on amputation or mortality. Exercise may improve quality of life when compared with placebo or usual care. As time has progressed, the trials undertaken have begun to include exercise versus exercise or other modalities; therefore we can include fewer of the new trials in this update.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-12-19 08:24:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:50:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Peripheral arterial disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for people in many Western countries. It is estimated that most adults have some degree of atherosclerosis by the time they reach middle age, and approximately 4% will develop intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1993</LINK>). As the population ages, the prevalence of claudication will increase. Risk factors for development of lower limb arterial disease are similar to those for coronary heart disease, and include smoking, raised cholesterol levels, hypertension, and diabetes.</P><P>Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between sedentary habits, functional decline, and worsening claudication (<LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2011</LINK>). The impact of exercise therapy on physical functional ability, muscle strength, and walking times has drawn increased focus since a review was prepared in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Parmenter-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmenter 2013</LINK>). Over the past few years, further research into calf muscle strength has supported known changes in muscle architecture while enhancing focus on the impact of these changes in relation to walking distance and physical function. Researchers have described reduction in myofibre cross-sectional area, enzymes, and power (<LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahllof-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Dahllof 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koutakis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koutakis 2015</LINK>), along with alterations in gait (<LINK REF="REF-Gommans-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gommans 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2012</LINK>), among patients with intermittent claudication.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:48:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Peripheral arterial disease covers a spectrum ranging from asymptomatic disease through to claudication, critical limb ischaemia, and finally limb loss. Within this spectrum, most people have relatively stable disease, termed 'claudication'. Intermittent claudication occurs secondary to atherosclerosis of the lower limb arteries, resulting from impaired blood flow. Whether at rest or when walking slowly, this reduction may go unnoticed; however during periods of exercise or walking with additional loads, for example, carrying while shopping, a cycle of pain requiring short rests occurs. This muscular, cramp-like tightening of the calf, the buttocks, or the foot on walking is known as 'claudication'.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:48:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Treatment options for intermittent claudication include bypass surgery, angioplasty, and drug therapy, but the mainstay of treatment for many patients with mild to moderate claudication remains advice to 'stop smoking and keep walking' (<LINK REF="REF-Housley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Housley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCGC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC 2012</LINK>) while modifying cardiovascular risk factors.</P><P>Exercise therapy or programmes usually require a regular weekly commitment, lasting from six weeks to a year. In general, programmes are run twice or three times per week. Duration can vary; usually a minimum of 30 minutes is required per session.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-12-08 11:50:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Researchers have conducted numerous studies of exercise therapy using various regimens that differ in duration and intensity; many of these studies suggest that exercise can prove beneficial for individuals with intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1992</LINK>). Underlying mechanisms through which exercise may effect improvement include increased and more effective distribution of blood flow to the legs (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1987a</LINK>), improved rheological characteristics of the blood (<LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1987</LINK>), less reliance on anaerobic metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Ruell-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruell 1984</LINK>), and greater use of oxygen (<LINK REF="STD-Dahllof-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Dahllof 1974</LINK>).</P><P>A systematic review of the effect of exercise on lower limb haemodynamics in individuals with mild to moderate claudication identified 33 trials. In these trials, investigators reported no change when comparing effects of control versus exercise therapy on resting ankle brachial index (ABI), postexercise ABI, resting calf arterial blood flow, reactive hyperaemic blood flow post ischaemia, and resting toe systolic pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Parmenter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmenter 2011</LINK>). An extensive non-systematic review of the literature focussed on exercise training in people with claudication and physiological changes associated with exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>). This review discussed how regular exercise improves endothelial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). Exercise training also improves FMD in those with claudication.</P><P>Exercise is proposed to improve walking among claudicants through angiogenesis. Underlying biomechanisms by which this may occur include ischaemia, sheer stress secondary to exercise, and remodelling of skeletal muscle (<LINK REF="STD-Hiatt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hiatt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Regensteiner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regensteiner 1993</LINK>). Researchers have done extensive work on the changes that occur in skeletal muscle secondary to claudication. These changes can be summarised as a change in capillary density (<LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1985</LINK>), as a ratio of type I to type II fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hiatt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hiatt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sj_x00f6_str_x00f6_m-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjöström 1982</LINK>), or as increases in arteriogenesis and mitochondrial activity. Trialists have described subsequent changes in skeletal muscle that can occur with training in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Lundgren-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundgren 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terjung-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terjung 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2009</LINK>), as well as in animal models with artificial hindlimb stenoses (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1991</LINK>).</P><P>More recently, researchers have explored changes secondary to differing exercise programmes, while focussing on calpain activity, which has been associated with muscle atrophy in animal models. When trial authors explored effects of walking regimens versus strength training combined with walking, they noted that neither was seen to alter calpain activity (<LINK REF="REF-Delaney-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 2014</LINK>).</P><P>The impact of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) on lower limb skeletal muscle becomes apparent when focussing on daily tasks or measuring strength.

That review provided good evidence for the best type of exercise therapy but did not compare findings with non-exercised control groups. The present Cochrane review focusses on randomised controlled trials only and encompasses additional endpoints. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (<LINK REF="REF-NCGC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC 2012</LINK>) currently advocates that all patients with PAD should undergo an exercise programme as first-line treatment. Numerous other studies have echoed this advice (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauret-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauret 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willigendael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willigendael 2005</LINK>).

We excluded trials that used alternation (e.g. allocation by date of birth or days of the week). We included trials that did not perform intention-to-treat analysis, provided all randomised participants were accounted for. We excluded trials for which numerical data were not available in a usable format, despite contact with study authors, but that were otherwise suitable.</P><P>We included studies in this review if they focussed on exercise versus usual care or other medical interventions. We excluded studies focussing on exercise compared with other forms of exercise, unsupervised exercise, angioplasty, or surgery, to prevent overlap with other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1998</LINK>).

Inclusion of trials was not affected by duration, frequency, or intensity of the exercise programme, but these issues were taken into account in the meta-analysis. This review did not consider supervised versus unsupervised exercise because this is the topic of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>). Walking advice provided by consultants in clinic can be seen as the best medical treatment or control. However, this may also be deemed unsupervised exercise. Therefore, we excluded from this review all studies that provided best medical treatment, which includes walking advice.</P><P>To avoid overlap with other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1998</LINK>), this review excluded all modalities by which exercise can be compared with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or surgery.

Although most studies examined outcomes at three or six months, it is important to note that this benefit would appear to be sustained for up to two years (<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 1991</LINK>). Of note, however, data show improvement in maximum walking distance at six months but not at three months.</P><P>Mean improvements in walking distance and walking time with exercise were clinically and statistically significant; however in most cases, the data were not normally distributed. Some individuals responded with improvement of considerably larger magnitude than the mean, whereas others responded less well, which may reflect varying compliance with exercise programmes. Successful programmes generally comprised physiotherapy with supervised exercise two or three times per week for 30 to 60 minutes, often with walking, leg exercises, or treadmill training. Some programmes encouraged additional home exercise.</P><P>We used percentage change from baseline to allow a more holistic understanding of change in walking ability. These additional parameters have demonstrated an increase in both initial claudication and maximum walking percentage changes, in keeping with changes documented for initial claudication walking distance and time, as well as for maximum walking distance and time. Of note, use of combined data allowed inclusion of 15 studies and a larger cohort of participants in the analysis.</P><P>Data related to ankle brachial index (ABI) and to other important outcomes are sparse. Investigators provided no data on non-fatal cardiovascular events and inconclusive data regarding mortality and amputation.</P><P>Antiplatelet therapy was less effective than exercise in improving walking distance and other measures of lower limb function, but researchers presented no data pertaining to fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. A previous meta-analysis has shown that antiplatelet agents reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in people with claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Trialists-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trialists 1994</LINK>). Therefore, aspirin should be of benefit despite lack of effect on the lower limb.</P><P>The single small trial comparing pentoxifylline with exercise showed that participants on drug therapy had significantly longer walking distances after three months than those on exercise therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ciuffetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ciuffetti 1994</LINK>). Investigators reported no cardiovascular or adverse events among those on pentoxifylline, but disadvantages of drug treatment might include cost and lack of general cardiovascular improvement. <LINK REF="STD-Arosio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arosio 2001</LINK> showed that exercise improved pain-free walking time significantly more than iloprost, but this was a small study (24 participants).</P><P>Pneumatic foot and calf compression showed no clear effect on walking distances compared with exercise, again in a small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kakkos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkos 2005</LINK>). However, alternatives for improving blood flow among those with poor mobility represent an important area for future research in those who are unsuitable for exercise programmes. Therefore further research into such avenues may yield more certain results and may therefore be of interest.</P><P>Researchers reported quality of life data on a range of scales, which made it difficult to incorporate this information into a meta-analysis. Results were variable depending on the comparisons made; this is a topic for future research.<BR/></P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:04:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall, it is not contested that exercise may provide benefit for individuals with intermittent claudication. However, the overall benefit and duration of exercise programmes differ. A standardised approach with a minimum duration of six months appears to confer benefit and would improve both pain-free and maximum walking distance. Review authors found scant data on the benefits of a six-month programme compared with a three-month programme when measured outcomes focused on quality of life, mortality, or amputation risk. The general assumption is that exercise training is safe in peripheral arterial disease, but the data presented are often focussed on mortality and limb loss. Other cardiovascular morbidity appears to be under-reported, and additional details on safety data within exercise studies would be of value.</P><P>Criteria for participant selection resulted in exclusion of many individuals with stable claudication for whom exercise was not practical or safe owing to pre-existing medical conditions. As most people with intermittent claudication are elderly, comorbidities are common. For up to a third of people, exercise may not be a suitable option. Other research trials and reviews have examined optimum modes of exercise for people with intermittent claudication, for example, a Cochrane review explored supervised versus unsupervised exercise for intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>). The present review cannot resolve uncertainties about different exercise regimens.</P><P>This review did not investigate the issue of non-compliance, which has a large impact on the use of supervised exercise classes and how funding should be allocated for this treatment as advocated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (<LINK REF="REF-NCGC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC 2012</LINK>). Further information on the cost-effectiveness of exercise programmes is needed.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:17:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We the review authors continue to believe that the quality of evidence is high in supporting exercise as first-line treatment for symptomatic claudicants. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. In this review update, we have added only two studies that support the body of literature already presented.</P><P>Compared with the previous version of this review, the evidence presented has improved in quality, as reporting criteria have become more stringent. In general, the bias present within papers was often difficult to assess owing to absence of relevant information. In these cases, we marked risk of bias as unclear, as evidence on which to base a judgement was insufficient. Overall, included studies were of moderate methodological quality.</P><P>Pooled outcomes for walking distance and maximum walking distance at all time points demonstrated significant heterogeneity. This most likely was secondary to pooling of walking times from some studies at two years and reporting of outcomes after three months in other studies. When possible we addressed this heterogeneity by analysing data at specific time points, such as three and six months post intervention. Regardless of this, data showed improvement in initial walking distance and time at three months, and in maximum walking distance and time by six months.</P><P>Publication bias remains an additional confounding factor for the quality of evidence pooled within this review. Older studies have been reported more poorly, as journal reporting criteria were previously less rigorous, resulting in greater inherent bias.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:04:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched the Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for new publications about exercise in patients with intermittent claudication. Two review authors independently assessed all new studies in keeping with recommendations provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P><P>The main cause of bias within this review is that walking advice provided by consultants in clinics is now seen as the best medical advice but may also be deemed as unsupervised exercise. Therefore this review excluded all studies that reported best medical treatment, which includes walking advice, as we believe this would overlap with the Cochrane review on supervised versus unsupervised exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>). It remains possible that usual care included walking advice, but this was not explicitly stated by trialists in their study papers, suggesting one possible aspect of reporting bias within studies.</P><P>It is the review authors' feeling that as claudication research develops, a usual care non-exercise control group will cease to exist, as its inclusion will be deemed unethical.</P><P>Finally, earlier studies used treadmill walking distance as the primary outcome measure, and this has continued to serve as a method for assessment of improvement in claudication. Whilst treadmill distances remain a reliable means of assessment, this method is being superseded by other functional and subjective assessments. Newer assessment tools to assess changes in walking distance include GPS tracking, six-minute walks, subjective reporting, and assessments based on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). It is important that future reviews consider inclusion of these as outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Cucato-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cucato 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tew-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tew 2013</LINK>).</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:05:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review is consistent with previous versions (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>) and adds to the body of available evidence supporting exercise for people with intermittent claudication. This evidence is also in line with NICE guidelines, which recommend that exercise should be provided as first-line treatment for people with intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="REF-NCGC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC 2012</LINK>). Other meta-analyses such as <LINK REF="REF-Parmenter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmenter 2011</LINK> and other reviews such as <LINK REF="REF-Lauret-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauret 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lauret-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauret 2012a</LINK> also support this finding.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:05:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:05:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review provides high-quality evidence showing that exercise therapy should play an important part in the care of selected patients with intermittent claudication, to improve walking times and distances. Effects were demonstrated following three months of supervised exercise, although some programmes lasted longer than one year. Limited data suggest that an effect is sustained for up to two years. Exercise did not improve ankle brachial index (ABI), and investigators detected no differences in the effect of exercise between groups in terms of amputation or mortality. Exercise may improve quality of life when compared with placebo or usual care.</P><P>Antiplatelet agents were less effective than exercise in improving walking distance but should continue to be used because of benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and death. In contrast, pentoxifylline was more effective than exercise but may have fewer beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in general. Iloprost led to less improvement in walking time than exercise. Data show no clear effect on walking distances when pneumatic foot and calf compression was compared with exercise. However the number of participants in these studies is small and data are limited.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-12-08 12:05:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Important questions involve the degree of supervision required in any exercise regimen and how long any change in exercise habits can be expected to last. Therefore, a trial with long follow-up - of five years - is needed to compare the effectiveness of different supervised and unsupervised regimens in terms of changing long-term exercise patterns. Behavioural changes and attitudes towards exercise have been items of key interest in areas such as cardiovascular rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Jolly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolly 2009</LINK>). More recent studies have demonstrated that brief psychological interventions may play a key role in improving walking distances among patients with intermittent claudication up to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2012</LINK>). A telling aspect of research into claudicants' beliefs is their poor overall understanding of the disease and of why walking is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2014</LINK>). Future holistic exercise programmes, which may include cognitive-behavioural therapy and lifestyle and risk factor modification, could provide great benefit in encouraging people to start and maintain a better overall lifestyle.</P><P>Future research should also focus on compliance with exercise and how this could be improved. Outcome measures should include fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. In addition, expansion of this review to assess the benefit of exercise for asymptomatic patients and its impact on cardiovascular morbidity is an important goal.</P><P>Further cost-effectiveness analysis is required to determine whether the cost of supervised sessions might offset the cost of deterioration in terms of surgery or occupation of in-patient beds for complications such as myocardial infarction.</P><P>A trial is needed to compare exercise treatment with pentoxifylline to determine whether the benefit of drug treatment is sustained over a longer period, and whether data show any differences in cardiovascular events. Further investigation of pneumatic foot and calf compression for treatment of individuals with intermittent claudication is also needed. Consistency in use of quality of life measures among different trials would be helpful in linking outcomes to patient-assessed improvements.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-12-19 08:23:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We are very grateful to Cochrane Vascular for assistance provided in the search for new trials and to Dr Brian Ellis for his input in previous versions of this review.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2017-12-19 08:22:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>RL: none known.<BR/>AH: none known.<BR/>LW: none known.<BR/>GCL: I am responsible for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Implementation programme and I am the Executive Director of NICE.
