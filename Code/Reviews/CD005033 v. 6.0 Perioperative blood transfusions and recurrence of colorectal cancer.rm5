<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-03 19:51:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review include 36 studies, identified from 278 references retrieved until December 2009, and report a moderate association between colorectal cancer recurrence and perioperative transfusions, with an OR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.67). Similar estimates are present in several subgroup meta-analyses, as well as in meta-analyses stratified for known risk factors. These findings support carefully restricted indications for perioperative blood transfusions in colorectal cancer patients operated for cure, and continue to await the results of studies addressing the role of surgeon-related risk factors on the need for transfusion and disease recurrence.</P>

<P>This meta-analysis evaluates the role of perioperative blood transfusions (PBT) on colorectal cancer recurrence. This is accomplished by updating the results of a previously published meta-analysis (Amato 2006) to December 2009.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-03 20:18:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Papers were retrieved using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, trials web-based registries, or the CCG Database. The search strategy was: {colon OR rectal OR colorectal} WITH {cancer OR tumor OR neoplasm} AND transfusion. The publication bias was balanced by reviewing the proceedings of international congresses.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-10-03 20:19:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients undergoing curative resection of colorectal cancer (classified either as Dukes stages A-C, Astler-Coller stages A-C2, or TNM stages T1-3a/N0-1/M0) were included if they had received blood products within one month of surgery. Excluded were patients with distant metastases and studies with short follow-up or no data.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-10-03 20:19:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A specific form was used for data collection. Data was cross-checked, using the most recent publication in case of repetitive ones. Papers' quality was evaluated using the method by Evans and Pollock. Odds ratios (OR, with 95% confidence intervals) were computed for each study, and pooled estimates were generated by RevMan (version 5). When available, data were stratified for risk factors of cancer recurrence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-13 14:37:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Updating the previous review through December 2009 identified 41 additional papers, for a grand total of 278 references. Two-hundred and fourty-two of them were excluded because they analyzed survival (n=27), were repetitive (n=29), letters/reviews (n=71) or had no data (n=115). Thirty-six studies on 12,127 patients remained included: 23 showed a detrimental effect of PBT; 22 used multivariable analyses, and 14 found an independent PBT effect. Pooled estimates of PBT effect on recurrence in randomised studies yielded an OR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.67) against transfused patients. Stratified meta-analyses confirmed these findings also by site and stage of disease, regardless of timing, type, and in a dose-related fashion, although heterogeneity was detected. Data on surgical techniques was not available for further analysis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-03 20:07:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated meta-analysis confirms the previous findings and supports the association of PBT on the recurrence of curable colorectal cancers. However, since heterogeneity was detected and the effect of surgical technique could not be assessed, a causal relationship cannot still be claimed. Carefully restricted indications for PBT seems necessary.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-13 14:38:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>It is well established that renal allograft survival is improved by blood transfusions before transplantation, with a dose-response relationship between the number of transfused units and long-term allograft survival rates (<LINK REF="REF-Opelz-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opelz-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanfilippo-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanfilippo 1984</LINK>). However, the exact mechanisms of the host immunomodulation remain unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Terasaki-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terasaki 1984</LINK>). Prompted by the identification of this lasting immunosuppressive effect, in 1981 Gantt expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of transfusions in patients being treated for cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Gantt-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gantt 1981</LINK>). Within one year, the first experimental study showing tumor growth promotion by allogenic blood transfusion was published (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1981</LINK>) and, shortly after, the first retrospective report linking perioperative blood transfusions (PBT) to colorectal cancer recurrence appeared in the same journal (<LINK REF="STD-Burrows-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 1982</LINK>). Following these early reports, several other studies have been published in the literature, with conflicting results as to the verification of the working hypothesis, that is that PBT, by decreasing the mechanisms of cancer immune surveillance, is responsible for increased colorectal cancer recurrence.<BR/>
</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to evaluate the recurrence rates of colorectal cancer for patients operated with curative intent and receiving perioperative blood transfusion (PBT), compared to the same type of patients not receiving PBT. We want to evaluate the hypothesis that PBT result in increased colorectal cancer recurrence in these patients, as indicated by some papers in the literature, although at variance with others. <BR/>Furthermore, a meta-analysis can lead to a better estimation of the transfusion effect (if any), and to a minimization of the type-II statistical error, due to small sample sizes in some of the reported studies.</P>

<P>We will consider both randomised controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohorts and retrospective surveys.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients treated either by colonic resection, anterior resection of the rectosigmoid, or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum with curative intention; disease classified as either Dukes stages A to C, Astler-Coller stages A to C2, or TNM stages T1-3a/N0-1/M0; a negligible proportion (&lt;5%) or absence of patients treated with adjuvant therapy. <BR/>We will exclude studies considering patients with distant metastases at surgery; studies with follow-up less than six months; studies in which crude recurrence rate or disease-free survival were not indicated; and studies in which control patients received some blood components</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any amount of blood products given to the patients is considered a transfusion. The type of blood component used in each study will be searched consistently throughout, in order to identify a specific effect, if any. The perioperative period included one month before and after the operation, comprising surgery.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome will be colorectal cancer recurrence, measured either as crude recurrence rate or, when this is not available, its actuarial estimate (i.e., 1 - disease-free survival). Survival or mortality will be recorded and qualitatively discussed, but not quantitatively assessed in this meta-analysis, since it is less temporally related and less biologically associated with PBT.</P>

<P>A search of the literature published between January 2005 and December 2009 will be conducted by scanning the Index Medicus, searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the controlled trials register at www.controlled-trials.com, and the CCCG Specialised Register. The following MESH terms and search strategy will be used: {colon OR rectal OR colorectal} WITH {cancer OR tumor OR neoplasm} AND transfusion.</P>
<P>The bibliographies of the retrieved articles will be examined thoroughly to identify further eligible studies. The tendency not to publish negative trials will be balanced by an inspection of any retrieved proceedings of international congresses of surgery. There will be no language restrictions.</P>
<P>The newly collected studies will be integrated with the studies identified by the previous Cochrane systematic review on this subject matter (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 2006</LINK>) which, conversely, was an update of a published meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Also for this updated review, the authors analysed data on the primary outcome published in English (or with an English abstract) between January 2005 and December 2009, using the Cochrane methodology and software.</P>
<P>As suggested by the Meta-Analysis Cooperative Group, the present review will consider both RCTs, prospective cohorts and retrospective surveys, since its aim is mostly "hypothesis-generation". To guarantee the Cochrane high standards, however, separate analyses will be conducted for these types of studies, and their results compared.</P>
<P>A specific data extraction form will be used to help gather all necessary information. Data extraction will be cross-checked by two reviewers (AA and MP) separately, and differences resolved. When several papers described the results of the same study, only the most recent publication will be considered.</P>
<P>Quality assessment of the included trials will be performed using the scoring system by Evans and Pollock (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The odds ratio (OR) and the rate difference (RD) will be computed for each report, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the RevMan software (v. 5.0) to be compared against the previous results (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 2006</LINK>). The common OR and the pooled RD with 95% CI for all studies will be computed according to both the "fixed effect" model and the "random effects" model; the latter is more conservative when there is heterogeneity among the studies. A chi square test for heterogeneity will be routinely performed using the built-in feature in the RevMan software (v. 5.0).</P>
<P>Stratified meta-analyses will be conducted to control for factors which could influence recurrence. These will include both known risk factors (site and stage of the tumors), and possible risk factors, either transfusion-related (type, amount, and timing of PBT), or surgery-related (amount of blood loss, type and duration of operation, experience of surgeons).</P>
<P>Confounders such as age, sex, complicating disease, etc. will be considered for possible stratified analyses of the pooled transfusion effects. If individual studies analyse such confounders by multivariate techniques, these will be presented and discussed qualitatively. Finally, sensitivity analyses will also planned to check the consistency of the pooled estimates in response to changes of the included studies.</P>
<P>Power calculations for each identified paper will be performed according to Fleiss (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1973</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-01-13 14:37:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The additional search identified 278 reports on the possible influence of PBT on colorectal cancer recurrence, published up to December 2009. An assessment of these revealed 29 repetitive publications, 71 review articles or letters, and 115 papers with different objectives, or no data. Twenty-seven further studies, on a total of 9,803 patients, were excluded because they analyzed either survival or mortality: 15 (6,531 patients) showed a detrimental transfusion effect, 11 were inconclusive, and one even stressed a protective transfusion effect on recurrence.</P>
<P>This led to 36 original studies being considered for this meta-analysis, for a total of 12,127 patients. Twenty-three papers showed a statistically significant adverse effect of PBT on the outcome of 8,029 patients; 15 studies showed no difference in 4,098 patients, and one of them reported a protective effect of PBT on recurrence of stage C2 patients. Seven were Randomized Controlled Trials (<LINK REF="STD-Frankish-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Frankish 1985</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Cheslyn_x002d_Curtis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cheslyn-Curtis 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harder-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Harder 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tartter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tartter 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Houbiers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Houbiers 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Busch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Busch 1995</LINK>), three of which were performed with different objectives, and derived their results on PBT effect retrospectively. Three were prospective cohorts (<LINK REF="STD-Sene-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sene 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sibbering-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sibbering 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mynster-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mynster 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 23 studies recurrence was further checked by multivariable analyses, in order to control for possible confounders: PBT were found to have an independent effect on recurrence in 14 studies (4,472 patients), to have no influence in eight (2,938 patients), and even to show a protective effect for colon cancer patients in one (<LINK REF="STD-Weiden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Weiden 1987</LINK>). Notably, in one study the failure to show an independent effect was marginal (p=0.057, <LINK REF="STD-Modin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Modin 1992</LINK>); another was significant for more than three units (<LINK REF="STD-Houbiers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Houbiers 1994</LINK>), and two further studies, claiming no independent effect on recurrence, did show evidence of such an effect on survival (<LINK REF="STD-van-Lawick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">van Lawick 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Liewald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Liewald 1990</LINK>). The average relative risk for PBT was 2.23.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The 36 included studies had a mean quality score of 66±12, according to Evans and Pollock. </P>
<P>Most of the included studies had small sample sizes. The mean sample size was of 337±231 patients; the power to detect the difference actually observed in each report was less than 80% in 30 of them, and none of the studies showing no PBT effect was able to achieve it. </P>

<I>
<U>Overall meta-analysis</U>
</I>
<BR/>The individual estimates from the included papers (up to December 2009) led to exclude a publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The results of the overall meta-analysis showed a recurrence rate of 37% in the transfused group, and of 26% in the non-transfused group, with a transfused to non-transfused ratio of 1.90. The common OR was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.54 to 1.83, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), and the pooled RD 0.11 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.13), almost superimposable to previous estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>). Significant heterogeneity was detected ( chi-square=103.5, df=35, p&lt;0.01).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of these estimates. Similar results were obtained when the analysis included only either the retrospective studies (OR=1.91; 95%CI, 1.71 to 2.13, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), or the studies with multivariable procedures (OR=1.71; 95%CI, 1.53 to 1.90, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Interestingly, the inclusion of the studies with higher quality (OR=1.71; 95%CI, 1.46 to 2.01, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), or of the prospective studies (OR=1.36; 95%CI, 1.18 to 1.56), or of the randomised trials specifically designed to test the PBT effect (OR=1.65; 95%CI, 1.31 to 2.08, <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), yielded similar and significant ORs, but with no significant heterogeneity .</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Site and Stage of Disease</U>
</I>
<BR/>Colonic tumors recurred in 31% of the cases, and in 11 studies showed pooled estimates similar to those computed in all studies (OR=1.64; 95%CI, 1.36 to 1.98). Information on rectal cancers was available in 12 studies, leading to a common OR larger than that obtained for colon cancers, and with no significant heterogeneity (OR=2.03; 95%CI, 1.61 to 2.57, <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sixty-one percent of patients with Astler-Coller stage A-B1-2 were transfused, with an overall recurrence rate of 30% (OR=1.93; 95%CI, 1.58 to 2.37, <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). Sixty-eight percent of those with a more advanced stage received a transfusion, and showed an overall recurrence rate of 53% (OR=1.51; 95%CI, 1.18 to 1.92, <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>). Both these pooled ORs showed a significant heterogeneity across studies.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Transfusion-related risk factors </U>
</I>
<BR/>The timing of PBT seemed not to affect the risk of recurrences. Pre-operative data, obtained from five studies, showed an overall recurrence rate of 30% (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>), similar to those computed for intra- and post-operative transfusions (32% and 30%, respectively), derived from nine studies (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>).Their ORs were close to those obtained in all studies, and with no significant heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Both red blood cells and whole blood were associated with an increased risk of recurrence. Seven (OR=1.65; 95%CI, 1.35 to 2.01, <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>) and five studies (OR=2.07; 95%CI, 1.55 to 2.76, <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>), respectively, contributed to this analysis, while data on plasma were present in one study only.</P>
<P>Finally, increased risks were observed with an increased number of transfused units: one to two units showed an OR of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.67, <LINK REF="FIG-15" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 15</LINK>), which became 1.69 for three to four units (95% CI, 1.40 to 2.03, <LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK>), and 2.02 for five or more units (95% CI, 1.65 to 2.48, <LINK REF="FIG-17" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 17</LINK>). Significant heterogeneity was detected in these analyses.</P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Surgery-related risk factors</U>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-13 14:38:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the first study on the possible effect of PBT over recurrent colorectal cancer, the hypothesis made by the authors was that the immunosuppressive effect of blood transfusions, well established through its use in renal transplantation, could be extended to cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Burrows-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 1982</LINK>). Blood transfusion effects in dialysis patients are now generally accepted and, although their exact mechanisms are still obscure (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1995</LINK>), a generalized suppression of cell-mediated immunity has been suspected (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Waymack-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Waymack 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tartter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tartter 1988</LINK>). However, the transient reduction in helper and suppressor cells that follows normal surgery is unlikely to be affected by blood transfusions, and, in cancer surgery, the postoperative depression of in vitro lymphocyte responses attributable to transfusions is not documented by all authors (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1989</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Studies with animal models might have contributed to a better understanding of the role of PBT on cancer growth but, unfortunately, they created more questions than answers, due to great differences in timing, route, tumors, species, and strains used (<LINK REF="STD-Marquet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marquet 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeekel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jeekel 1995</LINK>). Moreover, the specifically responsible blood component has not been identified: both red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma have been involved (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1985</LINK>, ). Finally, another debated issue refers to the questioned immunogenicity of tumors as opposed to allografts. In fact, they differ in terms of type and duration of antigen expression, and their comparability is therefore cast into doubt (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>With this background, many authors have investigated the relationship between the recurrence of some tumors and PBT (<LINK REF="STD-Tartter-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tartter 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vamvakas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vamvakas 1995</LINK>), as well as factors affecting morbidity, mortality and survival for colorectal cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lobaziewicz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobaziewicz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macadam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macadam 2005</LINK>). The greatest amount of research has been conducted on colorectal cancer, with respect to which this meta-analysis has identified 36 original papers, widely differing in their designs, analysis, and results. Nearly two thirds of them, however, reported a significant detrimental effect of PBT on recurrent tumors. Furthermore, in almost all negative studies the inspection of both the observed difference and the power of the study itself should have led the authors to state that results were inconclusive, or that a type-II error was possible: this was considered in only a few such papers (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Weiden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jakobsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jakobsen 1990</LINK>). In fact, in order to identify a difference of 15% with 80% certainty, and accepting a 5% significance level, one would need 226 to 275 patients, taking into account non-cancer deaths and patients lost to follow-up. In this respect, many studies had insufficient sample sizes. Therefore, their pooling substantially reduced the possibility of a beta-error, and increased the likelihood of detecting small differences .</P>
<P>All these considerations, as well as the non conclusive evidence from the literature, have represented the rationale for the present meta-analysis. Our results show a harmful transfusion effect, with overall odds of recurring 68% higher and rate difference 11% larger in transfused patents operated for colorectal cancer. These results are significant, and are consistent when examining only retrospective studies, or studies with multivariable analyses. However, significant heterogeneity was detected in these cases, thus confirming the wide differences in design and populations of the included studies. A further analysis was conducted including only the studies of higher quality, the prospective studies, or the specific RCTs: significant findings of the same magnitude in effects size were obtained in these cases, but without heterogeneity. Furthermore, all these results confirm our early reports (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>), and are also supported by the more recent findings by Chung et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1993</LINK>) and by Vamvakas et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Vamvakas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vamvakas 1993</LINK>), derived from a smaller number of trials (n=8 and 9, respectively). In particular, the pooled estimate obtained by Vamvakas et al. in their first "qualitative" meta-analysis (OR=1.37, 35b) is similar to our estimate when only prospective studies are taken into account, and their subsequent meta-analysis for explanation showed an overall unadjusted relative risk for colorectal cancer recurrence of 1.50 (95%CI, 1.18 to1.90) in 15 studies, being 1.18 (95%CI, 0.93 to 1.51) in seven prospective studies, and 1.68 (95%CI, 1.35 to 2.08) in 16 studies with regression analyses. The authors concluded that a possible effect of confounding could not completely explain the unadjusted transfusion effect (<LINK REF="STD-Vamvakas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vamvakas 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Particularly interesting are the results of the four specific randomised controlled trials, which have been performed recently with the specific aim of verifying the detrimental association between allogenic PBT and colorectal cancer recurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Tartter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tartter 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Busch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houbiers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Houbiers 1994</LINK>). The first study, designed to use allogenic packed red cells in the transfusion arm as opposed to no transfusions, showed a detrimental effect of PBT, with a two and half risk of recurring for transfused patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tartter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tartter 1992</LINK>). The other three studies compared autologous to allogenic blood. Among them, that by Heiss et al. showed a two times bigger risk of recurrence with transfusions, although their 95%CI were not significant (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1994</LINK>). Busch et al. highlighted a detrimental effect of allogenic transfusions (OR=1.85, 95%CI 1.22 to 2.82), although they attributed the increased transfusion risk to the conditions necessitating the transfusions, more than to PBT per se (<LINK REF="STD-Busch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Busch 1995</LINK>). Finally, Houbiers et al. showed a non significant effect of PBT on recurrence (OR=1.23, 95%CI 0.87 to 1.73) but, surprisingly, they found a difference in survival in favour of non-transfused patients (<LINK REF="STD-Houbiers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Houbiers 1994</LINK>). The conclusions of both the latter studies, however, have raised some questions, related not only to a relatively large proportion of patients receiving allogenic blood even in the autologous arm, but also to other methodological issues. The pooled PBT effect computed in these studies was in accordance with that observed overall, but without significant heterogeneity. It has to be underlined that none of the RCTs could randomise between transfusion and no-transfusion.</P>
<P>A meaningful interpretation of our results was also achieved by considering PBT effect over recurrence in patients stratified by known prognostic factors. With regard to tumor site, both rectal and colon cancers confirmed a detrimental effect of PBT, in contrast with one conclusion of Vamvakas et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Vamvakas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vamvakas 1993</LINK>). Rectal cancers, which were transfused more often than colon cancers, showed a higher risk of recurring, with an approximately twofold increase in their odds. Colonic cancers showed a lower recurrence risk when given PBT, and this might be further impacted by the increasing adoption of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. As far as the different tumor stages were concerned, a significant PBT effect was confirmed consistently throughout, although with significant heterogeneity across studies. This effect was less evident in the advanced C stage, where it was probably masked by the concomitant negative effect of advanced disease, known as the major cause of recurrent colorectal cancer, and weighting more than transfusion as an independent prognostic factor in all multivariable analyses examined.</P>
<P>Our results were also stratified according to other prognostic factors that could have been independently associated with blood transfusions and cancer recurrence. These included variables such as preoperative anaemia, duration of operations, volume of blood loss, as well as amount, type and timing of PBT, which have been linked to depressed immune response and early cancer recurrence. These analyses could have helped to clarify whether transfusion was simply a "proxy variable", that is a variable reaching statistical significance despite any lack of causality with recurrence. In fact, transfusions could simply be an index of "nasty" tumors, which cause severe anaemia and are at increased risk of recurring, more than a direct cause of recurrence per se.</P>
<P>The analyses involving transfusion-related factors showed that recurrences were more likely with transfusions independent of their timing, and the type of blood product used. They also showed a dose-dependent relationship, with three or more units of transfused blood almost doubling the risk observed with one or two units. It has to be stressed that some heterogeneity was detected in these studies, and that these areas could be explored only in part, due to absent or unclear definitions for the type of blood used, and to the absence of specific data for the timing of PBT. No data were available to fully elucidate the effect of leukocyte depletion on recurrence.</P>
<P>Finally, none of the analyses considering surgical trauma or operative techniques could be carried out. A definition of these factors, which could have better clarified a possible cause-effect mechanism, was seldom given and only a few papers presented data to allow meaningful comparisons. In particular, it was impossible to address the complete removal of the mesorectum in the case of rectal cancer (a common practice these days, which might require more blood transfusions but achieve better local tumor control), as well as the possible differences related to number and seniority of the involved surgeons, issues that could have explained many differences in the reported recurrence rates.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-03 19:40:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The additional evidence published up to Decemeber 2009, when integrated with the previous data, confirms the previous conclusion of a moderate association between PBT and an increased risk of recurrence in colorectal cancer patients operated for cure. This still proves valid in both colon and rectal cancers, for early and advanced tumor stages, and most likely occurs in a dose-dependent way, regardless of the timing and type of the transfused blood. Because of the important implications of these implications, carefully restricted indications for PBT should be considered in colorectal cancer patients undergoing curative surgery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The above conclusion should represent the working hypothesis for future clinical trials, whose great challenge will be to control also for surgical procedures, quality and type of the blood to administer, target hematocrit, and concomitant use of immunomodulators or adjuvant chemotherapy.</P>
