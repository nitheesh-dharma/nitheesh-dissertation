<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychosis is a broad term that includes several mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic depression and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Psychotic disorders affect about 3% of the population and may cause high levels of disability, making it a significant public health problem both socially and economically.</P>
<P>Stress may result in the release of cortisol and has been linked with both onset and relapse of psychotic disorders. Elevated cortisol levels have been found in some people with psychosis, especially among those suffering with psychotic depression and those in earlier phases of psychosis. Antiglucocorticoid drugs have been reported to reduce the effects of cortisol and may be useful for people with psychotic depression and bipolar disorder. We reviewed all randomised trials comparing antiglucocorticoid and related drugs versus placebo in people with psychosis - prodromal psychosis or first episode of psychosis.</P>
<P>Eleven studies (involving 509 participants) were included in this review. Several antiglucocorticoid-related drugs were examined, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (n = 5), mifepristone (n = 4), dexamethasone (n = 1) and ketoconazole (n = 1). All participants were adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Most trials examined giving antiglucocorticoid drugs as an additional part of regular treatment. Available data from these trials revealed no effects for overall psychotic symptoms, 'positive' symptoms or 'negative' symptoms. One large trial comparing mifepristone versus placebo as the sole treatment revealed a significant difference in the proportion of people responding to treatment with mifepristone versus placebo. This effect was not seen immediately but 21 days after the intervention was begun. Adverse effect data varied. When individual anticorticoids such as mifepristone and DHEA were compared with placebo, the incidence of side effects was similar between groups; however, pooled data on various antiglucorticoids given as an adjunct to combination treatment showed that antiglucocorticoids increased incidence of side effects than placebo. In summary, very few trials are under way, and most involve a small number of people. Limited available data do not provide enough evidence to support the use of antiglucocorticoid treatments for psychosis; additional trials are needed.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiglucocorticoid and related drugs compared to placebo (either as a sole treatment or as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, antidepressants or other combination treatment) for people with a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, or for individuals at high risk of developing a psychotic disorder.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for continuous measures. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-16 13:42:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 11 studies that randomly assigned 509 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. No trials were conducted in patients at their first episode of psychotic illness and none included populations at high risk for developing psychosis. Our pre-stated outcomes of interest were mental state, global state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life.</P>
<P>Two trials compared antiglucocorticoid drugs (mifepristone) versus placebo as sole treatment. Limited data from one trial showed no difference in the proportion responding to mifepristone when mental state was assessed immediately post intervention using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 5, 1 RCT, MD -5.20, 95% CI -17.91 to 7.51; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>); depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) total) were also similar between groups (n = 5, 1 RCT, MD 1.67, 95% CI -16.44 to 19.78; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). However, a significant difference favoured treatment at short-term follow-up for global state (30% reduction in total BPRS, n = 221, 1 RCT, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; <I>low-grade quality evidence</I>). This effect was also seen for short-term positive psychotic symptoms (50% reduction in BPRS positive symptom subscale, n = 221, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; <I>low-grade quality evidence</I>). Participants receiving mifepristone experienced a similar overall number of adverse effects as those receiving placebo (n = 226, 2 RCTs, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). No data on general functioning or quality of life were available.</P>
<P>One trial compared an antiglucocorticoid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotic treatment to adjunctive placebo. Data for main outcomes of interest were of low quality, and analysis of useable data showed no significant effects of treatment on mental state or adverse effects. Data on global state, general functioning and quality of life were not available.</P>
<P>Data from six trials comparing antiglucocorticoid drugs as an adjunct to combination treatment versus adjunctive placebo showed no significant differences between groups in mean endpoint scores for overall psychotic symptoms (n = 171, 6 RCTs, SMD 0.01, 95% CI - 0.29 to 0.32) or positive psychotic symptoms (n = 151, 5 RCTs, SMD -0.07, 95% CI - 0.40 to 0.25). Data from three trials showed no differences between groups in mean endpoint scores for negative symptoms (n = 94, 3 RCTs, MD 2.21, 95% CI -0.14 to 4.55). One study found improvements in global state that were similar between groups (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.06; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). In this comparison, pooled results showed that antiglucorticoids caused a greater overall number of adverse events (n = 199, 7 RCTs, RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.32; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), but no quality of life data were available.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Good evidence is insufficient to conclude whether antiglucocorticoid drugs provide effective treatment for psychosis. Some global state findings suggest a favourable effect for mifepristone, and a few overall adverse effect findings favour placebo. Additional large randomised controlled trials are needed to justify findings.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychosis is a generic term that encompasses a group of severe mental illnesses with considerable variation in prognosis, including schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic depression and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. The lifetime prevalence of psychotic disorders is relatively high at around 3%, with many sufferers having a high level of disability, making it a significant public health problem both socially and economically (<LINK REF="REF-Altindag-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altindag 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Per_x00e4_l_x00e4_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perälä 2007</LINK>). Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for psychosis. The newer atypical antipsychotics are preferable to typical antipsychotics, as they are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwin 2004</LINK>). Atypical antipsychotics are generally effective in alleviating the 'positive' symptoms (e.g. hallucinations, delusions) but have only modest effects on 'negative' (e.g. anhedonia, withdrawal, flat affect) and cognitive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Keefe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keefe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 1999</LINK>). A significant proportion of patients are treatment resistant, and many do not achieve complete remission of symptoms. Although fewer extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported, significant adverse effects are associated with antipsychotic treatment, such as weight gain and diabetes mellitus, which can lead to increased risk of a range of co-morbid medical conditions and medication non-compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez_x002d_Jimenez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez-Jimenez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newcomer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcomer 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychosocial interventions (such as cognitive-behavioural treatment) for psychosis have been associated with reasonable levels of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Pilling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilling 2002</LINK>). Shifting the focus of intervention from chronic illness to intervention at earlier stages of the illness has also resulted in better outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Killackey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killackey 2007</LINK>). An increase in interest has been noted in the delivery of treatments to young people at ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing a psychotic disorder, or with subthreshold symptoms, to reduce the likelihood of this group transitioning to a full-blown psychotic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-McGorry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGorry 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The search for more effective and benign treatments for all phases of psychotic disorders is ongoing. These may involve alternative medications to atypical antipsychotics, or adjunctive treatments to augment symptom reduction or alleviate adverse effects. The search for more benign treatments is considered particularly important in the treatment of initial episodes of psychosis and for UHR patients as they are at an early stage of their illness, and the potential for positive outcomes is therefore greater (<LINK REF="REF-McGorry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGorry 2006</LINK>). Many UHR individuals will not go on to have psychosis with a chronic deteriorating course (<LINK REF="REF-Yung-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 2007</LINK>); therefore for these people, the risks associated with taking medications with serious adverse effects may outweigh the benefits.</P>
<P>Antiglucocorticoid and related drugs that target the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are increasingly investigated as treatment for psychosis, particularly for those at early stages of illness and/or as adjunctive treatment. Recent clinical trials suggest that the antiglucocorticoid drug mifepristone may be useful in the treatment of individuals with psychotic depression and bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The HPA axis has been implicated in the development and relapse of major psychiatric disorders, including psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2006</LINK>). Several studies have identified abnormalities of HPA axis function in patients with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Lammers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lammers 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1988</LINK>), psychotic depression (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1997</LINK>), bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2004</LINK>) and first-episode psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Pariante-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pariante 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2004</LINK>), and in those at prodromal stages of psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Higher levels of circulating cortisol and impaired regulation of the HPA axis have been reported, particularly among patients with psychotic depression and those in the acute phase of psychosis. It has been suggested that HPA axis dysfunction may cause or exacerbate psychotic and depressive symptoms and neuropsychological dysfunction. Supporting this is the observation that corticosteroid therapy used for a variety of medical conditions can often induce symptoms of depression and psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions, as well as cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>). In addition, Cushing's syndrome (a condition characterised by hypercortisolaemia) is associated with significant cognitive impairment, which improves when cortisol levels have returned to normal following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Starkman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starkman 1999</LINK>). Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to suppress HPA axis activity (<LINK REF="REF-Cohrs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohrs 2006</LINK>), and some evidence suggests that normalisation of HPA axis activity correlates with improvement in clinical symptoms among patients with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2005</LINK>). As a result, the HPA axis is increasingly viewed as an important therapeutic target in psychosis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-12-15 12:59:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large body of evidence suggests that stress and HPA axis function are important factors in the development of psychosis. Given the need for more benign treatments, particularly at earlier stages of psychosis, a review of the efficacy of antiglucocorticoid and related medications will be useful. These medications are increasingly popular, but given the uncertain efficacy and side effects for those with psychosis, a systematic review is essential. A Cochrane systematic review that examined use of antiglucocorticoids for mood disorders included nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2005</LINK>), and given the increasing number of trials investigating these medications for psychosis, this review is timely.</P>

When disputes arose, we discussed and documented decisions made and, if necessary, contacted authors of studies for clarification. For remaining problems, a third review author (BG, SH, LP) helped clarify issues and documented decisions made. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures when possible, but we include these data only when two review authors independently reported the same result.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted data onto standard, predesigned, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>the measuring instrument had not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The ideal measuring instrument should be a self report or a report completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that often this is not reported clearly, and under <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>, we noted whether this was the case.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Both endpoint and change data offer advantages. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change requires two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult to perform in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We have decided to use primarily endpoint data and to use change data only when the former are not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis if possible, as we preferred to use mean differences (MDs) rather than standardised mean differences (SMDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes often are not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to data before inclusion.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We entered into the analysis data from studies of at least 200 participants, for example, irrespective of the following rules, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered change data, as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed. We presented and entered change data into the statistical analyses.</P>
<P>For endpoint data:</P>
<OL>
<LI>When a scale started from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation. Values lower than 1 strongly suggest a skew, and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than one but lower than two, skew was suggested. We entered the data and tested whether inclusion or exclusion of data changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than two, we included these data because skew was less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>When a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can provide values from 30 to 210, we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew was present if 2 standard deviations (SD) &gt; (S - S min), where 'S' was the mean score and 'S min' was the minimum score.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended, if possible, to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month), to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>When possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data, which can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' and 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>) could be considered a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original study authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>When possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for antiglucocorticoids. When keeping to this makes it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not un-improved'), we reported data when the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This is noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<P>Again review authors BG, SH, LP and SB worked independently to assess risk of bias by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimation of effect and high risk of bias of the study, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P>
<P>If the two raters disagreed, we determined the final rating by consensus, with involvement of another member of the review group (BG, LP, SH or SB). When inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, we contacted study authors to obtain further information. We reported non-concurrence in quality assessment, but if disputes arose as to which category a trial was to be allocated, again, we resolved this matter by discussion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RRs are more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios, and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RRs by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) statistic with its confidence intervals is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and in its interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster-randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. First, study authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We included no cluster trials in this review. If we had identified such studies, we would have applied the following approach: When clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would present data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We would seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients and to ask for clustered data; we would adjust for these by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). When clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if obtained from a non-cluster-randomised study but with adjustment for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We sought statistical advice and have been advised that binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated by using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1 + (m - 1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed with ICCs considered and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect, which occurs when an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, psychological) of treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence of entry into the second phase, participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate when the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we used data only from the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>When a study had involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we would have presented additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data had been binary, we would have simply added these and combined them within the two-by-two table. If data had been continuous, we would have combined data by applying the formula provided in Section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When additional treatment arms were not relevant, we would not have used these data. One trial in this review included multiple (four) treatment arms, of which two were irrelevant.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data and would not use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table/s by downgrading quality.

<P>When attrition for a binary outcome was between 0 and 50%, and when these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). We assumed that all those leaving the study early had the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed the study, with the exception of the outcomes of death and adverse effects (for these outcomes, we used the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - for those who did not). We undertook a sensitivity analysis by testing how prone primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who completed the study to that point were compared with the ITT analysis under the above assumptions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain missing values from study authors. If these were not available, when measures of variance for continuous data were missing, but an exact standard error and confidence intervals were available for group means, and P value or 't' value was available for differences in means, we could calculate SDs by following the rules provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the standard error (SE) was reported, we calculated SDs by using the formula: SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) presents detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated SDs according to a validated imputation method based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude outcomes of a given study and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations by performing a sensitivity analysis that excluded imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Various methods are available to account for participants who leave trials early or are lost to follow-up. Some trials present only the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) and more recently investigators have used methods such as multiple imputation or mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) as the standard. Although the latter methods seem somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we believe that the high percentage of participants leaving studies early and differences between groups in reasons for leaving studies early often represent the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. Therefore we did not exclude studies on the basis of the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use data from studies based on more sophisticated approaches. For example, we preferred MMRM or multiple imputation to LOCF, and we presented completer analyses only if no ITT data were available. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "Incomplete outcome data" for the risk of bias tool.</P>

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We understand that no closed argument can be presented for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true, and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even when no statistically significant heterogeneity is observed. However, the random-effects model does present a disadvantage. It puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can inflate or deflate effect size. We chose a fixed-effect model for all analyses.</P>

Towards this end, we excluded trials with 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' for allocation concealment, trials with 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' for blinding of outcome assessment and trials with 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' for ITT analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Implication of randomisation</HEADING>
<P>We aimed to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if in some way the study report implied randomisation. For primary outcomes, we included these studies, and if we observed no substantive differences when implied randomised studies were added to those with better descriptions of randomisation, we included all data from these studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Assumptions for lost binary data</HEADING>
<P>When assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-up (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings of primary outcomes when we used our assumption/s, and when we used only data from people who had completed the study to that point. If we noted a substantial difference, we reported results and discussed them but continued to employ our assumption.</P>
<P>When assumptions had to be made regarding missing SD data (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings of primary outcomes when we used our assumption/s, and when we used only data from people who had completed the study to that point. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone results were to change when completer-only data were compared with imputed data on the basis of the above assumption. If we noted a substantial difference, we reported results and discussed them but continued to employ our assumption.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We analysed the effects of excluding trials judged to be at high risk of bias across one or more of the domains of randomisation (implied as randomised with no additional details available), allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting for the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. If exclusion of trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of effect estimates, we would have included in the analysis data from these trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Imputed values</HEADING>
<P>We also undertook a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials for which we used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster-randomised trials.</P>
<P>If we noted substantial differences in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we did not pool data from excluded trials with those of other trials contributing to the outcome but presented them separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Fixed-effect and random-effects</HEADING>
<P>We synthesised all data using a fixed-effect model; however, we also synthesised data for the primary outcome using a random-effects model to evaluate whether this approach would alter the significance of the results.</P>

<P>All trials except for two (<LINK REF="STD-Belanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belanoff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2006</LINK>) administered the intervention treatment as an adjunct to antipsychotic or regular treatment. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Strous-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2007</LINK>, antipsychotic treatment consisted of stable doses of olanzapine only. In <LINK REF="STD-Newcomer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Newcomer 1998</LINK>, participants received ongoing typical antipsychotic treatment, but anticholinergics were also administered. For all other trials, regular treatment involved a combination of atypical, typical and/or antidepressant or other psychotropic medication.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.3 Outcome scales</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">5.3.1 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>5.3.1.1 Brief Psychopathological Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale is used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms. Items are rated from zero (absent) to six (severe) according to clearly defined anchor points. Scores can range from 0 to 126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. The BPRS has displayed good concurrent and discriminant validity in studies involving psychotic participants (<LINK REF="REF-Faustman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faustman 1994</LINK>) and high inter-rater reliability ranging from 0.67 to 0.88 for individual items and overall score (<LINK REF="REF-Hedlund-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedlund 1980</LINK>). The BPRS positive symptom subscale (as defined by studies included in this review) consists of the following four core psychotic items of the BPRS: suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviour, disorganised thinking and unusual thought content.</P>
<P>5.3.1.2 Positive and Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale is used to evaluate positive, negative and other symptom dimensions in schizophrenia. This scale consists of 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system ranging from one (absent) to seven (extreme). This scale can be divided into three subscales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology (PANSS-G), positive symptoms (PANSS-P) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N).</P>
<P>5.3.1.3 Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1989</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale is widely used to assess negative symptoms in psychotic illness. It includes 25 items that collapse to five subscales: affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention.  All items are rated from zero to five (absent to severe).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">5.3.2.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>5.3.2.1.1 Response rates<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flores-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flores 2006</LINK>) used one or more of the following measures of efficacy based on BPRS or HAMD scale level of response: (1) 30% reduction in total BPRS score, (2) 50% reduction in BPRS positive symptoms subscale (four items of the BPRS); or (3) 50% reduction in HAMD.</P>
<P>5.3.2.2.2 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) and Anxiety (HAMA) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1959</LINK>)<BR/>The HAMD is an observer-rated scale that is used to assess the presence and severity of depressive states. This scale has 17-item and 21-item versions and is widely used for clinical assessment of depressive symptoms. The HAMA is widely used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms.</P>
<P>5.3.2.2.3 Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia &#8211; CDSS (<LINK REF="REF-Addington-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addington 1997</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale was specifically developed for assessment of the level of depression in schizophrenia. The scale is designed to assess the presence of depression separate from other dimensions of psychopathology in schizophrenia such as negative symptoms.</P>

High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>5.3.2.5.2 The St. Hans Rating Scale - SHRS (<LINK REF="REF-Gerlach-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerlach 1993</LINK>)<BR/>This multi-dimensional observer-rated scale is used to evaluate neuroleptic-induced hyperkinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia.</P>
<P>5.3.2.5.3 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale &#8211; AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale is used to assess abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs, such as tardive dyskinesia and chronic akathisia. Scoring consists of rating movement severity in anatomical areas (facial/oral, extremities and trunk) on a five-point scale (zero to four). A low score indicates low levels of dyskinetic movement.</P>
<P>5.3.2.5.4 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale &#8211; BARS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>This four-item observer-rated scale is used to assess the presence and severity of drug-induced akathisia. It is the most widely used comprehensive rating scale for akathisia and includes both objective items (e.g. observed restlessness) and subjective items (e.g. patient's awareness of restlessness and related distress), together with a global clinical assessment of akathisia.</P>
<P>5.3.2.5.5 Simpson and Angus Scale &#8211; SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale is used to evaluate the presence and severity of drug-induced parkinsonian symptoms. It is a 10-item rating scale, and each item is rated on a five-point scale from zero (complete absence of the condition) to four (extreme presence of the condition).</P>
<P>5.3.2.5.6 Weight gain</P>

Data were observed at day 28 for 170 of the 221 participants (77%). For the 51 participants with missing data at day 7 or day 28, BPRS and HAMD data were imputed by using a mixed-effects model for repeated measurements. In <LINK REF="STD-Nachshoni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nachshoni 2005</LINK>, of the 34 randomly assigned participants, four were withdrawn for failing to meet trial requirements because investigators altered medication dose during the study and conducted the analysis on 30 participants.

Seven participants failed to complete the 12 weeks of the cross-over randomisation phase because they withdrew study consent after randomisation but had previously received the first dose of study medication.

Investigators eliminated three participants from study analysis after they failed to complete three weeks of the randomisation phase (selected a priori).

In <LINK REF="STD-Strous-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2007</LINK>, nine participants dropped out during the intervention and researchers conducted an ITT analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Newcomer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Newcomer 1998</LINK>, analyses excluded participants with missing data (n = 3); however, investigators also ran analyses that included all participants (n = 19) by applying conservative adjustments for missing data. <LINK REF="STD-Ritsner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ritsner 2010</LINK> randomly assigned 58 participants to one of four treatment groups (pregnenolone - 30 mg, pregnenolone - 200 mg, DHEA - 400 mg and placebo).

Investigators conducted analyses on 44 participants, allocated 16 to placebo (five of whom left the study early) and allocated 16 to DHEA (three of whom left the study early). They conducted analyses on 11 participants in the placebo group and in 13 in the DHEA group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-16 10:38:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review includes data from 11 trials (involving 509 participants) that assessed the following antiglucocorticoid and related treatments: mifepristone, ketoconazole, dexamethasone and DHEA. The small number of trials in each comparison yielded insufficient evidence to permit definitive conclusions on the efficacy and safety of these treatments for psychosis as sole treatment or as an adjunct to regular treatment. Results for each antiglucocorticoid or related drug are summarised below. All findings are graded as of low or very low quality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>) with the exception of adverse events, which are more convincingly in favour of placebo.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Mifepristone</HEADING>
<P>Four trials assessed the efficacy of mifepristone as sole treatment (n = 225, <LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2006</LINK>; n = 5, <LINK REF="STD-Belanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belanoff 2001</LINK>) or as an adjunct to regular treatment (n = 20, <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2005</LINK>; n = 30, <LINK REF="STD-Flores-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flores 2006</LINK>) in patients diagnosed with psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Analysis of available continuous data showed no beneficial effect of mifepristone. For clinical response (dichotomous) variables, data from <LINK REF="STD-Flores-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flores 2006</LINK> revealed a favourable effect of mifepristone for clinically significant improvement in positive psychotic symptoms, but not in depression symptoms. Dichotomous data from <LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2006</LINK> showed no differences between intervention and control immediately post intervention; however at 21 days' follow-up, they revealed a beneficial effect of mifepristone for total and positive psychotic symptoms, but not for depression symptoms.</P>
<P>All trials reported the rate of general adverse events (refer to <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for a detailed description) and provided evidence for a higher rate of general adverse events with treatment. Only <LINK REF="STD-Flores-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flores 2006</LINK> stated that researchers observed no serious adverse events.</P>
<P>Too few trials were identified to investigate the efficacy of mifepristone treatment across diagnostic groups or the optimal method of treatment (e.g. single or adjunctive therapy, length of treatment).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Ketoconazole</HEADING>
<P>One trial (n = 15, <LINK REF="STD-Marco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marco 2002</LINK>) assessed the efficacy of ketoconazole, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, as an adjunct to regular treatment in patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. Data from this small trial show no benefit from treatment and in some cases a more favourable outcome with placebo. Study authors described no adverse events in the intervention group and none in the placebo group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. DHEA</HEADING>
<P>Five trials assessed the efficacy of DHEA as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotic (n = 40, <LINK REF="STD-Strous-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2007</LINK>) or combination treatment (n = 62, <LINK REF="STD-Ritsner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ritsner 2006</LINK>; n = 32, <LINK REF="STD-Ritsner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ritsner 2010</LINK>; n = 30, <LINK REF="STD-Strous-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2003</LINK>; n = 34, <LINK REF="STD-Nachshoni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nachshoni 2005</LINK>) in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. A large proportion of the data were skewed and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis. Data available for analysis showed no evidence for an effect of treatment on clinical symptoms. The rate of participant attrition or general adverse events did not differ between DHEA treatment and placebo. With regards to extrapyramidal symptoms, <LINK REF="STD-Nachshoni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nachshoni 2005</LINK> revealed a beneficial effect of treatment, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Strous-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2007</LINK> showed no effect of treatment.</P>

<P>No primary outcome data were provided in the trial involving dexamethasone treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Newcomer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Newcomer 1998</LINK>), and no evidence suggested an effect of dexamethasone treatment on cognitive functioning.</P>
<P>Available data were insufficient for comparison of the effects of intervention treatment in the following subgroups: (1) 'prodrome' versus 'first-onset' versus 'chronic'; (2) type of antiglucocorticoid drug; (3) adults versus adolescents; and (4) duration of untreated illness.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-12-16 10:38:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only short-term outcomes (up to 12 weeks) were assessed, and most studies measured outcomes immediately following cessation of the intervention. Three trials conducted follow-up assessments up to a maximum of 21 days post treatment and provided scant data on general functioning; however, this aspect would be more relevant to trials with longer follow-up assessments.</P>
<P>All trials were conducted in adult populations, primarily with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (eight of 11 trials). The remaining three studies were conducted in people with psychotic depression, and all trials involved mifepristone treatment. Some trials required a specified level of symptom severity for entry into the trial. No trials were conducted in patients at their first episode of psychotic illness and none included populations at high risk for developing psychosis.</P>

Most trials included fewer than 40 participants, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-DeBattista-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DeBattista 2006</LINK> (n = 225) and <LINK REF="STD-Ritsner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ritsner 2006</LINK> (n = 62). Just over half of the trials (seven of 11) used adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. It should be noted however that in some of these trials, it was necessary to request this information from the study authors because it was not adequately described in the publication. The remaining four trials did not adequately describe the randomisation and allocation procedures and therefore have unclear risk of bias. Most participants were followed up, or intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. A large proportion of available data, particularly regarding depression symptoms, was skewed and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis. Other risks of bias involved small sample size, and in some trials baseline imbalances in clinical symptom scores were apparent between intervention and control groups (refer to <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Analysis of final endpoint data in this review, as opposed to change scores, may have biased the results.</P>

<P>We tried to identify all relevant trials in our search. However, we may not have identified all studies.

Our review has been limited to articles written in English, so bias may involve including no studies published in languages other than English.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Strous-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Strous-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Strous 2007</LINK> reported an improvement in negative symptoms and/or depression and in anxiety symptoms with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment. In contrast, results of this review show no evidence for a beneficial effect of DHEA treatment on clinical symptoms. In partial agreement with this review, the 12-week cross-over trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ritsner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ritsner 2006</LINK> reported no significant clinical improvement with DHEA treatment, although the first six weeks of DHEA treatment was associated with significant improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores compared with placebo. These discrepancies are likely due to the type of data analysed (e.g. change scores vs final endpoint data) and the fact that data were skewed and were not included in the meta-analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>This review suggests that little trial-based evidence shows the effectiveness of antiglucocorticoid and related medications in treating individuals with psychosis. People with psychosis should continue to look at new trials and reviews in this area, as this review suggests that mifepristone may be effective, and with more trials, its effectiveness may be established in the future.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Given the lack of data at this stage, antiglucocorticoid treatments cannot be recommended. Very few trials have been conducted, and most have involved a small sample. Limited available data do not provide enough evidence to support or refute the use of antiglucocorticoid treatment for psychotic disorders, although some findings suggest a favourable effect for mifepristone. Additional trials are needed.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Some trials appeared to follow the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT statement</A> and offered clear reporting of the conduct of the trial, but this was not the case in all studies, and clearer reporting would have allowed this review to be more informative. Particularly disappointing was the lack of reporting of useable outcome data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Reviews</HEADING>
<P>Suggestions for future reviews include the neurosteroid pregnenolone, which is synthesised from cholesterol and is a precursor to glucocorticoids. Pregnenolone enhances learning and memory in rodents, and clinical trials are now being conducted to investigate adjunctive pregnenolone for cognitive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. See also <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Trials</HEADING>
<P>Well-designed, larger-scale trials are needed across the range of psychotic disorders and at different stages of illness. In particular, there is a need to investigate these types of treatments in at-risk and early psychosis populations. Treatments aimed at correcting HPA axis dysfunction might be more effective at early stages of illness, during which hyperactivity of the HPA axis is thought to be pronounced. These trials need to include outcome measures such as time to transition to psychosis and transition rate, along with assessment of clinical symptoms and general functioning. Neuroendocrine measurements and/or screening of patients with demonstrable HPA axis dysfunction for inclusion in the trial would be useful for delivering more targeted treatment. Trials with longer follow-up assessments are needed to determine the short-, medium- and long-term outcomes of these treatments. It will be important to assess levels of social and occupational functioning, which often are considered more pertinent to the clinician and patient than symptom reduction alone. Finally, trials need to follow CONSORT guidelines for reporting data from clinical trials (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>

<P>Since the protocol was published, we have updated the review in keeping with new RevMan 5 formatting. Main changes have involved identifying a primary outcome versus secondary outcomes and the approach to assessing and reporting on risk of bias in trials and in completing 'Summary of findings' tables. The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group has also updated its template for the Methods section, and we have updated these sections of the text to reflect this. For previous text, see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>As some trials were of very short duration, we have added a new category to the grouping of outcomes. Follow-ups less than two weeks were considered to be 'immediate-term', and 'short-term' follow-up was defined as two to 12 weeks post intervention.</P>

<P>Authors BG, SH, LP and SB independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose, we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data but added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. We collected information on participants (age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, diagnostic criteria and first-episode/prodromal criteria used, setting of care, country, inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial, duration of treated and untreated illness, previous treatment and psychiatric co-morbidity); interventions (description of medication, method of delivery, dose, duration of treatment, actual dosage received) and other interventions used in intervention group; interventions in comparison group with similar detail; outcome measures (description of measures used, timing of administration) and results (point estimates and measures of variability, frequency counts for dichotomous variables) and methods (randomisation and allocation procedure, blinding, number of participants randomly assigned, withdrawn, dropped out, analysed, baseline comparability, intention-to-treat analysis, other problems).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Authors BG, SH, LP and SB assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Risk of bias was assessed as 'yes', 'no' or 'unclear' on the following points.<BR/>1. Sequence generation<BR/>2. Allocation concealment<BR/>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors<BR/>4. Incomplete outcome data<BR/>5. Selective outcome reporting<BR/>6. Other sources of bias</P>
<P>All studies meeting inclusion criteria were included regardless of the outcome of the assessment of risk of bias. However, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary outcome excluding trials with 'no' or 'unclear' ratings for allocation concealment. Poor concealment has been associated with overestimation of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). All risk of bias items were summarised and described in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section.</P>
<P>When disputes arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, again resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible, we did not enter the data, and we added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment until further information could be obtained.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the fixed-effect model. Risks ratios are more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios, and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as risk ratios by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to overestimation of the impression of the effect. When overall results were significant, we calculated the number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for additional harmful outcome (NNTH). When people were lost to follow-up at the end of the study, we assumed that they had had a poor outcome, and that once they were randomly assigned, they would be included in the analysis (intention-to-treat/ITT analysis).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Rating scales</HEADING>
<P>A wide range of instruments are available for measuring mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality; many are not valid and are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore, we included continuous data from rating scales only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Final endpoint value versus change data</HEADING>
<P>When both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, we presented only final endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this, we may have excluded a large portion of the published change data but argue that endpoint data are more clinically relevant, and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, they would be given undeserved equal prominence. When studies reported only change data, we contacted study authors to ask for endpoint figures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Multiple linear regression data</HEADING>
<P>Many trials in psychiatry report estimates of treatment effects from multiple linear regression models. These models adjust for varying factors such as age, sex and baseline of the outcome. We pooled treatment estimates from these trials using fixed-effect (inverse variance) meta-analysis. We converted P values and confidence intervals for treatment effect to standard errors and entered them into RevMan using the generic inverse variance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues often are not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (1) Standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or could be obtained from study authors; (2) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise, the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); in cases with data that are greater than the mean, we entered data into the 'Other data' table as skewed data. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above in (2) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skewness is present if 2 SD &gt; (S - Smin), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'Other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale), it is impossible to tell whether or not data are non-normally distributed (skewed) unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we entered change data into RevMan analyses and reported the finding in the text to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated a mean difference (MD) when the same measure was used and a standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measures were used to measure the same outcome with a fixed-effect model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ cluster-randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. First, study authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). When clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation co-efficients of clustered data and will adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). When clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster-randomised study but will adjust for the clustering effect. We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect, which is calculated by using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1 + (m - 1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed with consideration of intraclass correlation co-efficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, psychological) of treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase, participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in psychosis, we have used only data from the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>When a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented additional treatment arms in comparisons. When additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We excluded data from studies in which more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% attrition, we considered people leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25% to 50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, we did not add the data to trials with less attrition but presented them separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>First, we considered all included studies within any comparison to judge for clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We supplemented this by using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than to chance alone. When the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was greater than or equal to 50%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of considerable levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>We assessed reporting bias by assessing whether data appropriate for use in the meta-analysis and/or results were reported for the main clinical outcomes of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>When appropriate, we performed meta-analysis and pooled effect estimates obtained by using the Review Manager statistical software programme. We used a fixed-effect model. When possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicated a 'favourable' outcome for the antiglucocorticoid interventions. Wem this was not possible, we labelled the graphs in RevMan analyses accordingly, so that the direction of any effects was clear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Clinical homogeneity was satisfied when participants, interventions and outcome measures were considered to be similar. When we found heterogeneous results, we investigated the reasons for this; when heterogeneity substantially altered the results, we did not summarise these data but presented them separately along with reasons for heterogeneity investigated by the following subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</P>
