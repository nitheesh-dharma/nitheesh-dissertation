<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 22:45:53 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Babies born early are at risk of death, lung problems (respiratory distress syndrome) and bleeding of the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage). Corticosteroids are given to the mother to help stop these problems occurring and there is high-quality evidence that they are effective in preventing many of these problems. These drugs work by maturing the baby's lungs before birth. There are different types of corticosteroids and they can be given in different ways and in different doses. Since there is no clear or agreed best type or dose, hospitals may vary in how they give this drug.</P>
<P>Most trials have compared the two most commonly used corticosteroids before early birth, dexamethasone and betamethasone. In this review of 12 trials (involving 1557 women and 1661 infants) of moderate quality, 10 trials compared dexamethasone and betamethasone; one trial compared two different ways of giving dexamethasone and one trial compared two different ways of giving betamethasone. We found that dexamethasone and betamethasone showed similar results, although there was less bleeding of the brain and a shorter length of neonatal intensive care unit hospital stay for dexamethasone compared with betamethasone. On the basis of one trial, giving dexamethasone by injection (intramuscularly) may be better than giving the drug to the mother by mouth (orally). Usually the drug is given in two doses 24 hours apart and one trial showed that this interval could perhaps be reduced to 12 hours if required. We need more studies to establish which is the best drug and what is the best way to give it, and babies in these trials need to be followed up over a long period to monitor any effects on child and adult development.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-13 16:53:25 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, 12 trials (1557 women and 1661 infants) were included. Dexamethasone was associated with a reduced risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) compared with betamethasone (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.92; four trials, 549 infants). No statistically significant differences were seen for other primary outcomes: respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.27; five trials, 753 infants) and perinatal death (neonatal death RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.67; four trials, 596 infants). Similarly, very few differences were seen for secondary outcomes such as rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) although in one trial, those infants exposed to dexamethasone, compared with betamethasone, had a significantly shorter length of NICU admission (mean difference (MD) -0.91 days, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.05; 70 infants). Results for biophysical parameters were inconsistent, but mostly no clinically important differences were seen.</P>
<P>Compared with intramuscular dexamethasone, oral dexamethasone significantly increased the incidence of neonatal sepsis (RR 8.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 64.93) in one trial of 183 infants. No statistically significant differences were seen for other outcomes reported.</P>
<P>Apart from a reduced maternal postpartum length of stay for women who received betamethasone at 12-hourly intervals compared to 24-hourly intervals in one trial (MD -0.73 days, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.18; 215 women), no differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes were seen between the different betamethasone dosing intervals assessed. Similarly, no significant differences in outcomes were seen when betamethasone acetate and phosphate was compared with betamethasone phosphate in one trial.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-26 19:26:51 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another.</P>
<P>Dexamethasone may have some benefits compared with betamethasone such as less IVH, and a shorter length of stay in the NICU. The intramuscular route may have advantages over the oral route for dexamethasone, as identified in one small trial. Apart from the suggestion that 12-hour dosing may be as effective as 24-hour dosing of betamethasone based on one small trial, few other conclusions about optimal antenatal corticosteroid regimens were able to be made. No long-term results were available except for a small subgroup of 18 month old children in one trial. Trials comparing the commonly used corticosteroids are most urgently needed, as are trials of dosages and other variations in treatment regimens.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-26 19:31:14 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation) poses a significant health burden affecting approximately 5% to 18% of all babies born globally (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haram 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-March-of-Dimes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">March of Dimes 2012</LINK>), with over 60% of all preterm births occurring in Africa and South Asia (<LINK REF="REF-March-of-Dimes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">March of Dimes 2012</LINK>). Preterm infants, especially those born before 32 weeks' gestation, are at high risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a serious complication that remains the primary cause of early neonatal death and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Haram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haram 2003</LINK>). Those infants born preterm who do survive the neonatal period are at a significantly increased risk of long-term neurological disability (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2007</LINK>). RDS develops as a consequence of surfactant deficiency and immature lung development. The risk of RDS and neonatal mortality reduces as gestation increases, reflecting maturity of organ systems (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moise-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moise 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2007</LINK>). Treatments that may reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants born preterm, including antenatal corticosteroids, have therefore received considerable attention (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids act by altering gene expression resulting in glucocorticoid effects, including gluconeogenesis, proteolysis, lipolysis, suppression of immune responses and mineralocorticoid effects, including hypertension, sodium and water retention and potassium loss (<LINK REF="REF-AMH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMH 2006</LINK>). In the fetal lung, the action of corticosteroids leads to an increase in protein production, biosynthesis of phospholipids and the appearance of surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1969</LINK> demonstrated that the lungs of lambs born preterm became functionally mature following antenatal corticosteroid administration. Following these initial animal studies, Liggins and other investigators conducted several clinical trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids before preterm birth in humans.</P>
<P>The Cochrane review <I>'Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth' </I>showed that a single course of antenatal corticosteroids significantly reduced the incidence of RDS (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.73; 21 trials, 4038 infants) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Other beneficial effects included a reduction in neonatal death, cerebroventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, infectious morbidity, need for respiratory support and neonatal intensive care unit admission. For the mother, corticosteroid use was not shown to increase the risk of death, chorioamnionitis or puerperal sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Contrary to the concern that corticosteroid treatment may increase infection in those with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Imseis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imseis 1996</LINK>), or increase the rate of stillbirth in those with pregnancy-related hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1976</LINK>), this Cochrane review confirmed that antenatal corticosteroid treatment is effective in women at risk of preterm birth with these complications (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Corticosteroids have become the standard of care for women at risk of preterm birth before 32 to 34 weeks' gestation in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite their widespread use, there is currently variation in clinical practice as to the type of corticosteroid used, the dose and frequency given, and the route of administration of corticosteroid doses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroid type</HEADING>
<P>Currently either betamethasone or dexamethasone are the recommended corticosteroid regimens used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1995</LINK>). Betamethasone is available in two different forms: betamethasone sodium phosphate, a solution with a short biological half-life of 36 to 72 hours; and betamethasone acetate, a suspension with a relatively long half-life (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katzung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>). These forms of betamethasone are often used in combination to maximize the drug's efficiency while reducing the number of injections given to the mother (<LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>). Dexamethasone generally comes in the form of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, a solution with a short biological half-life of 36 to 72 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katzung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both betamethasone and dexamethasone are able to cross the placenta in their active form and have comparable properties (<LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>). The chemical composition of betamethasone and dexamethasone are virtually identical except for the configuration of a methyl group in position 16 (<LINK REF="REF-Bar_x002d_Lev-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bar-Lev 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>). Some dexamethasone preparations contain a sulphite preservative (<LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>). Sulphites have been linked to neurotoxicity in the newborn especially when in combination with peroxy nitrite (<LINK REF="REF-Bar_x002d_Lev-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bar-Lev 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baud-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baud 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walfisch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walfisch 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The optimal type of corticosteroid to use for prenatal treatment remains unclear. The indirect subgroup comparison of betamethasone and dexamethasone in the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> Cochrane review indicated similar short-term neonatal outcomes for both drugs. Maternal outcomes were also similar although the risk of puerperal sepsis was higher in the dexamethasone versus placebo or no treatment group, while betamethasone did not show an increase in puerperal sepsis over placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). The results from observational studies are not always consistent with the results from randomised trials. For instance, a National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network (NICHD NRN) cohort study of over 300 infants reported a link between betamethasone and reduced risk of neonatal death, whereas dexamethasone was associated with an increased risk of neonatal death (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>). In contrast, the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> Cochrane review showed a reduced risk for fetal and neonatal death for both the betamethasone and dexamethasone groups compared with placebo/no treatment. In a later NICHD NRN report of part of this cohort, <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK> reported reduced adverse childhood neurological outcomes at 18 to 22 months for dexamethasone but not for betamethasone.<BR/>
<BR/>The long-term outcomes related to corticosteroid use have largely been positive. Within the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> Cochrane review, overall antenatal corticosteroid treatment was shown to be associated with less developmental delay in childhood, and a trend towards fewer children having cerebral palsy when compared with no corticosteroid treatment. It is not known if the long-term outcomes vary by type of corticosteroid used. While follow-up at 30 years following use showed no clinical differences in adults who were exposed or not exposed to betamethasone in utero (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2005</LINK>), there have been no similar long-term follow-up studies reported on dexamethasone use. There are no published data on the long-term effects of antenatal betamethasone compared directly with dexamethasone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroid dose, timing and frequency</HEADING>
<P>The optimal corticosteroid dose to use, timing of use and frequency of administration similarly remains unclear. The common regimens of two doses of 12 mg of betamethasone given intramuscularly 24 hours apart and the treatment of four doses of 6 mg of dexamethasone given intramuscularly 12 hours apart was recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Panel on the Effect of Corticosteroids for Fetal Maturation on Perinatal Outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1995</LINK>). This dose corresponds to a high occupancy of steroid receptors in fetal tissues. While the benefits of corticosteroids are well-known, there is concern regarding their potential for adverse effects, particularly at high doses. There is a suggestion that the current antenatal doses used may be higher than needed (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2004</LINK>). Similarly, the rationale for two doses of betamethasone and four doses of dexamethasone and the effects of using different formulations for the initial and subsequent injections remain unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNF6-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNF6 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroid route</HEADING>
<P>The optimal route of administration of antenatal betamethasone and dexamethasone is also uncertain. Both drugs may be administered as intramuscular injections. Betamethasone can be given intra-amniotically (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1982</LINK>) and intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1983</LINK>) and dexamethasone can be given orally (<LINK REF="STD-Egerman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Egerman 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Repeat doses of corticosteroid</HEADING>
<P>The reduction in the incidence of RDS by antenatal corticosteroid therapy has been shown to be effective up to seven days after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). A single dose of antenatal corticosteroid does not prevent RDS if it is administered seven days or more prior to birth (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Whether antenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth need to be repeated seven days after the initial course is assessed in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2011</LINK>); therefore, this review will not cover repeat steroid doses compared with single doses.</P>

This review found that while dexamethasone may have some benefits compared to betamethasone such as less intraventricular haemorrhage, it may also be associated with a higher rate of NICU admission (seen in one trial). Few other conclusions about optimal antenatal corticosteroid regimens could be made, and thus the review concluded that high-quality evidence from randomised trials was urgently needed in this area.</P>
<P>Despite the widespread use of antenatal corticosteroids to prevent RDS in preterm infants, there is still no consensus as to the type of corticosteroid to use; nor the dose, frequency, timing of use or the route of administration. This review assesses studies making a head-to-head comparison of different regimens of corticosteroid type, dose, timing, frequency of dose per treatment course and route of administration. Other corticosteroid Cochrane reviews have examined inter-study differences between drug regimens, in subgroup analysis. We have assessed these indirect comparisons comparing any corticosteroid with placebo following the methods outlined in an appendix accompanying <LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2003</LINK>, and by performing subgroup interaction tests on the trials from the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> review (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

As we identified substantial statistical heterogeneity for this outcome (T² = 0.80; I² = 81%) a random-effects model was used. It is possible that the differences in reasons for risk of preterm birth, or other clinical factors, between these trials contributed to this level of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>In one of the trials, significantly more infants were admitted to the NICU in the dexamethasone group compared with the betamethasone group. Seven of the eight infants in the dexamethasone group were transferred to the NICU because of respiratory distress and the remaining infant was transferred due to suspected infection. The reason for all four infants in the betamethasone group being transferred to NICU was because of respiratory distress. In the other trial of 240 infants (<LINK REF="STD-Danesh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Danesh 2012</LINK>), however, there was no significant difference in NICU admissions with 34 admissions in the dexamethasone group, compared with 36 in the betamethasone group. It appears that all 70 infants were transferred to NICU due to respiratory distress, however this was unclear.</P>
<P>No significant differences between the dexamethasone and betamethasone groups were seen for the outcomes vasopressor use (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.11; one trial, 359 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 61.34; two trials, 464 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>), severe IVH (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.24; four trials, 549 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>), periventricular leukomalacia (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.03; four trials, 703 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>), neonatal sepsis (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.19; two trials, 516 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>), necrotising enterocolitis (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.40; three trials, 598 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>), retinopathy of prematurity (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.47; two trials, 516 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>), or patent ductus arteriosus (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.49; one trial, 359 infants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>).

<P>Using the methods outlined in the additional material accompanying <LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2003</LINK>, we calculated indirect comparisons of the trials of betamethasone versus placebo/no treatment, and dexamethasone versus placebo/no treatment that were included in the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> Cochrane review (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We also performed subgroup interaction tests on these trials from the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> Cochrane review (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Considering fetal/neonatal death, the indirect estimate and subgroup interaction test were compatible with the findings of this review, indicating no significant difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone for this outcome.</P>
<P>For the outcome RDS, while the discrepancy between the direct estimate from this review and the indirect estimate was not significant, the indirect comparison did indicate a significant difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone in favour of betamethasone (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.90) that was inconsistent with the non significant difference shown in this review. In addition, the subgroup interaction test for RDS was inconsistent with the direct comparison in this review, indicating a significant difference between subgroups and a possible differential effect between the two steroids in favour of betamethasone (Chi²<SUP> </SUP>statistic: 4.68 and P value: 0.03, I² value: 78.6%).</P>
<P>While the indirect estimate for IVH did not reveal a significant difference between the two steroids as was shown in the direct comparison in this review (in favour of dexamethasone), the discrepancy between the indirect and direct estimates was non significant. The subgroup interaction test was however inconsistent with the direct estimate from this review, failing to show a significant difference between the two steroids for IVH (Chi² statistic: 0.78 and P value: 0.38, I² value: 0%).</P>
<P>Although chorioamnionitis and puerperal sepsis were not reported in any trials directly comparing betamethasone and dexamethasone included in this review, we estimated the indirect estimates and tested for subgroup differences in the trials from the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> review. While the indirect estimate and subgroup interaction test suggested no significant difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone for puerperal sepsis, both the indirect estimate (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.28) and the subgroup interaction test (Chi² statistic: 5.41 and P value 0.02, I² value: 81.5%) indicated a significant difference between the two steroids for chorioamnionitis, in favour of betamethasone.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-29 22:46:45 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>That antenatal corticosteroids are effective in preventing neonatal morbidity is not in dispute (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>) and this life-saving therapy is now widely used throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foix_x002d_L_x0027_Helias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foix-L'Helias 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinlivan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinlivan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saengwaree-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saengwaree 2005</LINK>). However, it is not yet clear which corticosteroid and which regimens perform best. Determining the optimal corticosteroid and optimal regimens is very important since most pregnant women at risk of preterm birth will be considered candidates for antenatal corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>) and these numbers may continue to grow as rates of preterm birth are increasing in a number of countries (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is considerable variation reported between countries as to whether dexamethasone or betamethasone is preferred by health practitioners, with many likely reasons for these differences including availability and costs (dexamethasone is cheaper than betamethasone so is widely used in low- and middle-income countries) (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saengwaree-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saengwaree 2005</LINK>), impact of inconsistent findings from observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Baud-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baud 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>) and influence of opinion leaders (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although we were able to include 12 trials (involving 1557 women and 1661 infants) rated of moderate quality, including one quasi-randomised trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Mushkat-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mushkat 2001</LINK>), our ability to reach conclusions was limited by the small number of comparisons of different antenatal steroid regimens. Most of the data available focused on the type of corticosteroid used, with 10 of the studies comparing the two most commonly used corticosteroids, dexamethasone and betamethasone (with some variation in frequency and timing of administration).</P>
<P>The results of this review are broadly consistent with results of the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> Cochrane review of antenatal corticosteroids when they are recalculated as indirect comparisons of dexamethasone versus betamethasone (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) (with no significant discrepancies between the direct and indirect estimates found). However, the suggestion of increased benefit of dexamethasone over betamethasone from this review for IVH is not sufficient evidence to support dexamethasone over betamethasone; while the discrepancy between the indirect and direct estimates for IVH was not significant, the indirect comparison from the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> review did not support the significant difference between the two steroids for IVH shown in this review, and neither did the subgroup interaction test. A recent observational study, which reported reduced adverse neurological outcomes at 18 to 22 months for betamethasone but not for dexamethasone, highlights the persisting uncertainty, stating that "to elucidate more fully predictive or causative neonatal or neurodevelopmental outcomes, a randomised clinical trial comparing dexamethasone and betamethasone should be performed" (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>). Such a trial would need to measure long-term effects, particularly for dexamethasone, as there has been no long-term follow-up reported in studies that have used this type of corticosteroid. One such trial has just completed recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Very few maternal outcomes were reported in the trials included in this review, with none of the review's primary or secondary maternal review outcomes reported in the 10 trials that compared dexamethasone and betamethasone. As noted in the results section, while the indirect comparison of dexamethasone and betamethasone from the <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK> review for puerperal sepsis suggested no significant difference between the two steroids, both the indirect estimate and subgroup interaction test suggested a significant difference for chorioamnionitis (in favour of betamethasone), which requires further evaluation. This review has not been able to provide any further evidence as none of the included trials reported on chorioamnionitis.</P>
<P>Although extensively reported in several of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Magee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Magee 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mushkat-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mushkat 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Rotmensch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rotmensch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senat-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Senat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subtil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Subtil 2003</LINK>), the clinical significance of differences in biophysical parameters such as fetal heart rate and respiratory rate is not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Rotmensch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rotmensch 1999</LINK>). Overall, these trials generally showed few differences between dexamethasone and betamethasone, except for a significantly lower heart rate at day two, a longer duration of breathing time at day two, and more fetal movements detected via ultrasound for the dexamethasone group. Some authors suggest that the influence of antenatal corticosteroids on parameters such as fetal heart rate is not clinically important, being a transient physiological response (<LINK REF="STD-Magee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Magee 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rotmensch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rotmensch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subtil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Subtil 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence about optimal doses, timing and frequency of administration of specific antenatal corticosteroids was even more sparse than that for type of corticosteroid, with three of the 12 trials contributing data to three separate comparisons. In regards to oral versus intramuscular dexamethasone, some benefits were shown for intramuscular administration, in regards to less neonatal sepsis, and a reduction in IVH for infants born before 34 weeks' gestation. No differences were seen for any of the reported outcomes when betamethasone acetate and phosphate was compared with betamethasone phosphate alone, although information was only available from one trial of 69 infants. In the trial that compared 12-hourly versus 24-hourly betamethasone administration, no differences were shown between regimens for the review's primary outcomes, however a reduction in maternal postpartum length of stay for women who received betamethasone at 12-hourly intervals was observed, and a trend towards reduced NICU admissions was also seen for infants in the 12-hourly group.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-26 19:11:50 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dexamethasone may have some benefits compared with betamethasone such as less IVH, possibly some improved biophysical parameters and a shorter length of NICU stay. Apart from the superiority of an intramuscular compared with an oral route for dexamethasone in one trial and the similar efficacy of 24-hour versus 12-hour dosing of betamethasone, so far there is little evidence to guide clinical practice about optimal antenatal corticosteroid regimens.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-08 23:58:16 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Further trials directly comparing the type, dose, frequency and route of betamethasone with dexamethasone for women at risk of preterm birth are required. They should be of high quality, large enough to assess morbidity and mortality of the fetus/infant, long-term outcomes and maternal outcomes; one such study has just completed recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2010</LINK>). High-quality trials are needed to establish which of the commonly used corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) is most effective and causes least harm (including at longer-term, assessments), as are trials of dosages and other variations in regimens.<BR/>

<P>In this update of the review: we have clarified that cross-over trials and cluster-randomised trials will be excluded, and that studies reported as abstracts only will be included.</P>
<P>We have reduced the number of primary outcomes for the baby to three (death, RDS and IVH) and have re-classified the remaining outcomes as secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>In previous versions of the review: we added the outcome of any neurodisability for the child, and for the child as an adult.</P>
<P>We have included a previously excluded subgroup (see below) in the review methods of this update as we believe that this maternal characteristic may affect health outcomes. However we were unable to perform this subgroup analysis due to insufficient data available in this update:</P>
<UL>
<LI>preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (at trial entry: yes versus no).</LI>
