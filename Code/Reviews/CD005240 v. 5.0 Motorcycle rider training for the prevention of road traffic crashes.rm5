<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-03 13:01:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Riders of motorcycles (a two-wheeled vehicle that is powered by a motor and has no pedals - <A HREF="Oxford English Dictionary Online">Oxford English Dictionary Online</A>), especially novice riders, have an increased risk of being involved in fatal crashes compared to other road users. Motorcycle rider training could be an important way of reducing the number of crashes and the severity of injuries.</P>
<P>The authors of this review examined all research studies that report an evaluation of the effectiveness of motorcycle rider courses in reducing the number of traffic offences, motorcycle rider crashes, injuries and deaths. This review included 23 research studies, including three randomised trials, two non-randomised trials, 14 cohort studies and four case-control studies. The types of rider training that were evaluated varied in content and duration. The findings suggest that mandatory pre-licence training may present a barrier to completing a motorcycle licensing process, thus possibly indirectly reducing crash, injury, death and offence rates through a reduction in exposure to riding a motorcycle. However, on the basis of the existing evidence, it is not clear if (or what type of) training reduces the risk of crashes, injuries, deaths or offences in motorcyclists and the selection of the best rider training practice can therefore not be recommended.</P>
<P>It is likely that some type of rider training is necessary to teach motorcyclists basic motorcycle handling techniques and to ride a motorcycle safely. It is therefore important that further research work be conducted to rigorously evaluate motorcycle rider training courses, particularly in low income countries where the main burden of motorcycle injuries and deaths occur.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-01 10:52:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed 23 studies: three randomised trials, two non-randomised trials, 14 cohort studies and four case-control studies. Five examined mandatory pre-licence training, 14 assessed non-mandatory training, three of the case-control studies assessed &#8216;any&#8217; type of rider training, and one case-control study assessed mandatory pre-licence training and non-mandatory training. The types of assessed rider training varied in duration and content.</P>
<P>Most studies suffered from serious methodological weaknesses. Most studies were non-randomised and controlled poorly for confounders. Most studies also suffered from detection bias due to the poor use of outcome measurement tools such as the sole reliance upon police records or self-reported data. Small sample sizes and short follow-up time after training were also common.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-23 18:49:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Due to the poor quality of studies identified, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of rider training on crash, injury, or offence rates. The findings suggest that mandatory pre-licence training may be an impediment to completing a motorcycle licensing process, possibly indirectly reducing crashes through a reduction in exposure. It is not clear if training (or what type) reduces the risk of crashes, injuries or offences in motorcyclists, and a best rider training practice can therefore not be recommended. As some type of rider training is likely to be necessary to teach motorcyclists to ride a motorcycle safely, rigorous research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-06 10:57:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-03 13:02:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each year, an estimated 1.2 million people are killed in road crashes worldwide and an additional 50 million people are injured. Of these deaths, 85% occur in low-income and middle-income countries. It has been predicted that between the year 2000 and 2020, without increased efforts, the number of road traffic deaths in high-income countries will decrease by approximately 30%; yet in low- and middle-income countries the number is expected to increase by over 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Kopits-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopits 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>). Road traffic injuries are likely to become the third leading cause of a global burden of disease and injury by 2020 if further action is not taken (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Riding a motorcycle (a two-wheeled vehicle that is powered by a motor and has no pedals - <LINK REF="REF-Oxford-English-Dictionary-Online" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford English Dictionary Online</LINK>) is associated with a higher risk of fatalities compared with driving a car (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjornstig-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjornstig 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radin-Umar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radin Umar 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FORS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">FORS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yuan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2008</LINK>). In Australia, motorcycles accounted for 4.5% of all Australian passenger vehicle registrations and 0.9% of vehicle kilometres travelled in 2007. However, motorcycle riders accounted for approximately 15% of all road crash deaths and an even higher proportion of serious injuries. Per distance travelled, the Australian rate of motorcyclist deaths was approximately 30 times the rate for car occupants. The corresponding rate for a serious injury was approximately 41 times higher. Similar elevated rates were also found in other developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2008</LINK>). In low and middle-income countries, the motorcycle is one of the most frequently used means of transport and consequently motorcyclists constitute a large proportion of road crash victims (<LINK REF="REF-Mohan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lack of experience of many motorcycle riders has been cited as one potential cause of motorcycle crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Winn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullin 1997</LINK>). Training of motorcycle riders has therefore been suggested as an important countermeasure for reducing both the number of crashes and the severity of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Vis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noordzij 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pre-licence motorcycle rider training courses have been made compulsory in several countries (<LINK REF="REF-Mullin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullin 1997</LINK>). Pre-licence training courses are aimed at providing motorcycle riders with the skills and knowledge needed to improve control of the motorcycle and to identify and avoid critical situations in traffic (<LINK REF="REF-Elliot-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot 2003</LINK>). Many pre-licence motorcycle rider training courses are aimed at novice riders and in many jurisdictions in high-income countries such as Australia, the USA and Canada, the completion of such courses is a mandatory requirement of licensing.</P>
<P>Post-licence rider training is not linked with licensing and such training is generally not compulsory. It usually focuses on riding skills and other topics that have not been covered, or dealt with sufficiently, in pre-licence rider training. Post-licence rider training is used to reinforce fundamental skills and knowledge, or to provide some training for motorcyclists who are self-taught and have never received formal training (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Estimates of the number of motorcyclists attending post-licence rider training are not readily available, but existing data suggest such courses are not well attended, although attendance varies by country. In the USA, 24% of the total number of motorcyclists trained in 1988 and 1989 attended an experienced rider course (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to quantify the effectiveness of pre-and post-licence rider training for motorcycle riders in reducing traffic offences, road traffic crash involvement, injury and death.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-MAIDS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MAIDS 2004</LINK> case-control study did make a distinction between participants having received compulsory pre-licence training or additional (non-compulsory) training. We did not find a study that compared one form of pre- or post-licence training (e.g. on-road, off-road, theory, or a combination) versus another form of training. All studies compared either mandatory or non-mandatory formal training versus no formal training, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>, who compared different levels of training courses (beginner, intermediate and advanced).</P>
<P>We have presented a more detailed description of the individual studies in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. We have provided a description below of the types of motorcycle rider training that were evaluated in the included studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of motorcycle rider training evaluated in the studies</HEADING>
<P>The types of training were varied. Duration of training ranged from two or three hours to 24 hours administered over two or three days. Most training consisted of a theoretical and a practical component, usually off-road. The content ranged from providing riders with manuals, lectures, discussions, showing films and administering knowledge and skill tests. Little information was provided about the qualifications of trainers who conducted the training.</P>
<P>Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK>) assessed the effectiveness of the USA-based Motorcycle Safety Foundation&#8217;s Motorcycle Rider Course (MSF MRC). This course was released in 1976. It comprises eight hours of theory (lectures, discussions, films and multiple choice tests), a textbook and 12 hours of off-road practice. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation is a national, not-for-profit organisation sponsored by manufacturers and distributors of motorcycles. Many USA states have adopted the MSF Basic Rider Course and Experienced Rider Course (<A HREF="http://www.msf-usa.org/">www.msf-usa.org</A>) since its release in 1976.</P>
<P>The Motorcycle Operators Skill Test was also developed by the USA Motorcycle Safety Foundation in cooperation with others (<A HREF="http://www.webbikeworld.com/motorcycle-training/motorcycle-test/">http://www.webbikeworld.com/motorcycle-training/motorcycle-test/</A>). The MOST is a licensing test consisting of a manual, knowledge and skill test (comprising eight exercises of increasing difficulty and skill requirements) and a mini-skill test conducted with a simulator. Some studies compared this alternative licensing test to the standard licensing test. However, as the MOST is not a type of rider training, we have included only the two studies that assessed the MOST in combination with one or more training components in this review. Both <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> assessed the MOST in combination with a training component of three hours' duration, consisting of instructions about the skills needed to pass the MOST (30 minutes of theory and two and a half hours on the motorcycle). <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> also assessed the MOST in combination with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation&#8217;s Motorcycle Rider Course as described above.</P>
<P>Other USA studies evaluated the Wisconsin motorcycle rider course, a 22-hour off-street programme that teaches the basic rules of safe motorcycling (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>); the USA Maryland Motorcycle Rider Course (MRC), a mandatory (for those younger than 18 years) pre-licence 20-hour course comprising eight hours of theory and 12 hours of practice and created by the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration in 1985 (<LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>); the California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP), a mandatory (for those younger than 18 years) pre-licence 16-hour basic course (<LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>); and Experienced Rider Course (ERC) of eight hours' duration (<LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>). The CMSP still offers these courses (<A HREF="http://www.ca-msp.org/">http://www.ca-msp.org/</A>), but they are now MSF courses as described above. <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK> did not give any information about the assessed rider training.</P>
<P>The Canadian studies evaluated the British Colombia Safety Council's 37-hour motorcycle safety programme (no further information on the content was provided) (<LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK>); and the Canada Safety Council Motorcycle Training Program (MTP) comprising four hours of theory and 16 hours of practice (six hours on-road) over two weekends (<LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>). The MTP course was made available in 1974 and is still being offered in Canada (<A HREF="http://www.safety-council.org/training/mtp/mtp.htm">http://www.safety-council.org/training/mtp/mtp.htm</A>). <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK> did not give any information about the assessed rider training. However, the study was conducted in British Colombia in Canada in 1988, the same time as the <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK> study was conducted.</P>
<P>In the United Kingdom, <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK> assessed the non-mandatory RAC/ACU (Royal Automobile Club/Auto-Cycle Union) training scheme. The training programme consisted of either 24 one-hour sessions or 13 two-hour sessions. Twelve hours of the training focused on theory about basic operational procedures, traffic laws and highway codes. The practical session focused on basic operational skills, riding on a training area and riding in traffic with an instructor. A proficiency test was administered at the end of the course.</P>
<P>One study from rural Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK>) evaluated a community-based rider education programme consisting of theory on motorcycle injury risk, helmet use, traffic laws, vehicle regulations and traffic signs, and a written and skill test leading to a licence.</P>
<P>The Australian studies evaluated a rider training course of 12 hours over two consecutive days (four hours of theory and eight hours of practice) administered to Australia Post telegram deliverers (<LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK>), and a mandatory pre-licence Ridersafe course consisting of two tiers: the first tier being a training course on the basics of motorcycle riding, where a pass entitled the rider to obtain a learner&#8217;s permit; and the second tier being a skill test where a pass entitled the rider to obtain a probationary motorcycle licence. The training course consisted of two four-hour training sessions on separate days involving instruction, videos and actual riding on motorcycles. The skill test consisted of a four-hour preparation course of 74 minutes of lecture/discussion, 38 minutes of video and 75 minutes of on-course riding which was the testing phase (<LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>). The Rider Safe course is still being provided by Transport South Australia, a state government organisation (<A HREF="http://www.transport.sa.gov.au">http://www.transport.sa.gov.au</A>).</P>
<P>The duration or content of rider training in the four case-control studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAIDS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MAIDS 2004</LINK>) was not described.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-09-06 09:01:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We describe the methodological quality of the included studies by study type below. More detailed information can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>When considering the findings from these studies it is important to note the quality (or lack thereof) of reporting of the studies. Quality of reporting is the extent to which a report provides information about the design, conduct and analysis of a study (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Huwiler_x002d_M_x00fc_ntener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huwiler-Müntener 2002</LINK> found that even though trials may be well reported, it does not mean that the methodological quality is of equal standard; and well-conducted trials may nevertheless be reported badly. The reporting quality of most studies in this review was poor. Most studies were old and did not meet contemporary reporting standards. This made data extraction complicated. It also made it difficult to contact authors for additional information.</P>
<P>Because of significant heterogeneity between studies, as well as the poor quality of most studies, pooling of study results to calculate an overall measure of effect was not appropriate. Instead, we provided a description of our judgement of risk of bias in the text.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias in the randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>There were three randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> had an initial sample size of 41,188 and 26,464 motorcycle licence applicants respectively. Both studies assessed the effectiveness of the pre-licence MOST with a training component. <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of a community-based rider education programme in six districts.  </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation bias</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> reported using random birth date tables to allocate participants to either the intervention or control group. <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> reported the use of a computerised algorithm set in a central office, but also used manual random assignment when the computer went down. <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> reported &#8216;simple random sampling&#8217; for the delivery of the intervention where the sampling frame included nine districts. Three districts were excluded since they were too hard to access. The remaining six districts were randomly allocated to the intervention (three) and the control (three) groups. Systematic sampling was then used, ordered by village size, for the villages within districts. Allocation concealment was not reported in any of the studies. The descriptions of randomisation in these studies suggest that there may have been limitations to the process, resulting in a lack of equivalence of the intervention and control groups at baseline, and therefore the possibility of allocation bias. <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> reported that before the intervention, the annual incidence rate of motorcycle-related injuries was slightly (but not statistically significant) higher in the intervention areas than in the control areas. Participants in the intervention districts were also more likely to have a valid licence, and to wear a helmet more often than participants in the control districts. <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> measured differences at baseline on the participant and prior driving record variables and found these to be negligible. <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> did not report on baseline differences between the intervention and control groups. As the <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> studies had sample sizes of over 40,000 and 26,000 respectively and used some form of randomisation, it is likely that any confounding factors at baseline would have been equally distributed between comparison and intervention groups. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>After randomisation, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> excluded 0.8% and 3% participants, respectively, because of assignment to the wrong group, administration of the wrong intervention, or other reasons. The resulting lack of analysis by 'intention-to-treat' can introduce bias by removing the effectiveness of randomisation. Nonetheless, the percentage excluded was small and the number of overall participants large, so it is unlikely to have had a major effect on the final results. In the <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> study, villages were systematically sampled into intervention or control groups. The intervention was implemented, and outcomes of injury and death were measured, at a community level. Intervention and control districts were randomly selected, however there were only three intervention and three control communities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>None of the randomised trials reported blinding of outcome assessors. Data collection tools used by <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> were driver records holding police recorded crashes and offences. <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> used police and hospital records at a district level, and post-mortem examination for deaths. None reported on validity or reliability for any of the instruments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> had driver records available for 96% to 100% of participants. They also collected self-reported data but the response rate to the questionnaires was very low (lowest response rate 42% and 30% respectively). Attrition bias in <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> was not an issue, as outcome data were available for all sub-districts included in the trial.</P>
<P>The intervention reported in <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> trials had an unanticipated effect on the participants. In both trials, an average of only 28% of licence applicants in the intervention group eventually obtained their licence, compared to 35% in the control group. This indicates that the licensing process in general seems to have deterred applicants from obtaining a licence and, although no statistical tests of the difference were conducted, this deterrence appears even greater for those who had rider training. This is not true attrition bias, as the studies did not experience differential loss to follow up from outcome measurement. Instead, differential attainment of the intermediary step of licensure precluded participants from being at risk for the outcomes of interest: they are not driving a motorcycle hence they are not at risk for motorcycle-related crashes, injury, death or offences. In short, it is not possible to assess whether a reduction in crashes in the intervention group would be due to changes in riding habits as a result of training, or simply due to delayed or never attained licensure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention integrity</HEADING>
<P>Neither <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK> reported on the consistency in the way the intervention was administered; the possible &#8216;contamination&#8217; of participants in the intervention group by other types of formal or informal rider training, or of participants in the control group by the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> did not report on the number of villagers in each group that actually attended the intervention. However, they did report on a number of other potential training courses that were being implemented at the same time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>, acknowledging the &#8216;deterrent effect&#8217; described above, conducted two separate analyses. The first analysis included the total study population of licence applicants over two years from the time of their application (the population denominator). The second analysis was performed on the licensed (intervention and control) subgroups only, two years from the time of obtaining their licence (the licensed rider denominator). As only a third were licensed and exposed to riding the motorcycle, it was impossible to determine whether reported differences in crash rates across groups were due to the intervention or to other &#8216;confounding&#8217; characteristics of those who were determined in their efforts to obtain the licence. When analysis was restricted only to those who gained their licence, the same difficulties remained. The benefits of the randomisation process were thus lost due to this lack of licensure of riders during the process. As there were only three intervention and three control groups in the study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK>, analyses were hindered by small numbers for outcome comparisons between the intervention and the control districts.  </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>The confounding factors expected to have been addressed in the studies were: sex, age, riding experience, prior driving records (offences, crashes), previous training, and the following proxies for risk taking behaviour: helmet use, speed and alcohol/drug use. All of these factors have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of motorcycle crash (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zambon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zambon 2006</LINK>). The possible source of bias in cohort studies and non-randomised trials is that groups may differ on important characteristics at baseline; participants &#8216;self-select&#8217; into either the rider training group by deciding to undertake a rider training course, or into the &#8216;control group&#8217; by deciding not to undertake a course. Participants who undertake a non-mandatory rider training course may differ from those who choose not to, on characteristics such as age, sex, riding experience and riding behaviour as well as other possible confounders. For example, riders who take a training course may be more safety-conscious or, on the contrary may do so because they have previously experienced a crash, or because they perceive that they have poor riding skills. Therefore ideally all participants in the intervention group need to be included in the study, as well as a random sample of controls taken from the same population as the intervention group. If that is not possible, intervention and control groups either need to be carefully matched to make them comparable, or differences at baseline need to be adjusted for in the analysis.</P>
<P>Most of the studies using a non-randomised trial or cohort design compared an intervention group to a control group that differed on a number of important factors. The studies in general failed to adjust for important differences found at baseline and their results cannot be meaningfully interpreted. Ten studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK>) assessed intervention and control groups that were not drawn from the same population. In most of these cases the intervention group was selected from a list of training graduates who were usually young, female and less experienced riders, whereas controls were recruited from a general population of motorcycle riders who were usually older, male and experienced riders. For three studies it was unclear how they were selected (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK> recruited groups from the same population of motorcycle applicants and <LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK> from a group of professional riders. Nevertheless, due to non-random selection of intervention and control groups, differences at baseline are likely, even though study groups were from the same population. Three studies adjusted for some confounding factors found at baseline through matching (<LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>). However, matching has limitations in terms of controlling for multiple confounders, especially those that are unknown to influence the effect of rider training on the outcomes. One study matched the control and intervention groups by excluding controls (approximately 3500 (66% of initial control group) that differed from the intervention group) (<LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>). Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>) did not adjust for differences between study groups at baseline, either in the study design or analysis. Results from these studies are therefore not reliable. The other six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>) adjusted for some differences between groups at baseline by either bi-variate or multi-variate analyses, or stratification and standardisation of riding exposure (outcome/miles driven), or stratification by age group. The limitation of stratification is that it is difficult to control for many variables simultaneously because a large number of strata will need to be generated, resulting in small numbers that cannot be meaningfully analysed. <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK> developed statistical models to assess the probability of a crash after taking the rider training course in an intervention and control group, while examining differences by sub-groups (e.g. age). Participation rates were also very low in this study, with only 558/4000 (13.95%) in the eligible intervention group and 588/4000 (14.7%) for the control group completing surveys.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies reported blinding of outcome assessors to the intervention or control status of the participants. Seven studies used driver records containing police recorded data as their main measure of outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>).  Another four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>) only used self-report. <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK> was the only study using self-report as the main outcome measurement in which study instruments were validated. Self-report might prevent the underreporting that has been described for the use of police-driver records (see 'Risk of bias' in the randomised trials above) but has other risks of bias, especially if questionnaires or interview methods have not been validated and tested for reliability. Recall bias arises from mistakes in recollecting events, both because of failures of memory and because of looking at things &#8216;with hindsight&#8217; and possibly changed views (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/resources/glossary.htm">http://www.cochrane.org/resources/glossary.htm</A>). As many studies were retrospective, risk of recall bias is likely and may have increased with length of follow up. For studies that used self-reported outcomes only, it is also possible that social desirability response bias played a role where participants in the training group may have felt it was &#8216;expected&#8217; to report good driving histories. Multiple methods to measure the same outcome for both groups decreases the risk of detection bias, for example because self-reported answers can be cross checked with other sources of information such as driver records.</P>
<P>In this regard, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>) used both self-report and driver records. <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK> found that for both intervention and control groups, more crashes were reported through self-report than on state crash records: an average of 54% of self-reported crashes could be found back on state crash records. One industry-based study (<LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK>) used occupational health records which were not validated, but which are unlikely to suffer from underreporting due to work cover claims. <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK> used information on rider crashes for a five-year period, but did not specify from where this information was obtained.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>The majority of studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>) inadequately reported on losses of participants to the study. We can therefore not be certain that there were no systematic differences in the characteristics between the intervention and control group participants. <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK> reported the response rates to their baseline survey, but did not report on the percentage of outcome data that was available for their study sample.</P>
<P>A similar deterrent effect of rider training as described for the randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>) occurred in two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK> reported that 65% (1499/2310) of the trained riders stopped riding, compared to 47% (949/2029) of the untrained riders. They excluded non-active and non-licensed riders before the study commenced so the differential choice to continue riding after training did not affect their analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK> reported that the percentage of participants in the intervention group obtaining their licence was 50% (no number provided by authors) lower than in the control group. This may have biased the measurement of outcomes because unlicensed participants will not be exposed to riding the motorcycle and therefore not be at risk of being involved in a crash or violation. As explained above, this makes it difficult to assess whether the reduction in crashes in the intervention group is due to a change in driving habits or simply due to delayed licensure.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK> describe that about 44% and 30% of course graduates, respectively, were excluded from analysis because they had not ridden a motorcycle in the previous year. However, because these studies were retrospective and the controls were active riders at the time of recruitment, a decision on whether the deterrent effect was differential between the two groups could not be made. Though not reported quantitatively, <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK> also describes the effect of rider training deterring individuals from becoming licensed and hence exposure to riding and risk of crash, death or offences involving a motorcycle. <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK> reported that 27% of the trained riders did not ride after the course, and excluded these from the analysis.</P>
<P>Use of different data collection strategies may have contributed to differential loss to follow up in the cohort studies. <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>, for example, interviewed the intervention group over the telephone, but mailed questionnaires to the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK> distributed questionnaires in person to the control group, but mailed them to the intervention group. This may have played a role in the observed differential response rates where more subjects responded in the personally approached groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Survival bias</HEADING>
<P>For those studies that assessed offences, crashes and injuries, but not death, survival bias may have also played a role. Motorcyclists who were fatally or seriously injured in crashes during the follow-up period after the intervention would have been less likely or unable to respond to surveys. This could bias the effect measures towards or away from the null. None of the studies wrote about this issue or examined the characteristics of those lost to follow up in order to address the possibility of survival bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention integrity</HEADING>
<P>Although the interventions were intended for the entire &#8216;exposed&#8217; groups, most studies reported difficulty in tracking participants who received the intervention and those who did not. <LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK> estimated that 62% of the total study sample received the intervention. The remaining studies did not report the percentage of the study population that received the intervention as was intended, or reported that this percentage was unknown (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK> reported the degree to which their intervention was delivered as intended. No studies reported on possible &#8216;contamination&#8217; of participants by other interventions than the one to which they were allocated. Because <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK> were retrospective studies and participants were recruited from a list of graduates, it was known that they had completed and passed the course.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>In some studies, some participants who reported at baseline that they were untrained decided to enroll in a rider training programme after the baseline survey. The non-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK> experienced this move of subjects from the untrained to the trained group, but failed to conduct analyses by &#8216;intention-to-treat&#8217;. This can bias the results in randomised and non-randomised trials if participants who changed groups differ significantly with regard to potentially confounding characteristics. On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK> also experienced this move of subjects from the untrained to the trained group: more than 100 riders (5% of the total sample) originally stated that they were untrained at baseline, but then received training between the baseline and follow-up surveys. Yet, since the <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK> study was a cohort, their analyses then proceeded by including those riders who were &#8216;newly&#8217; trained as exposed. Riders who were &#8216;newly&#8217; trained since baseline, but with a programme other than the one under study, were excluded from the analysis. Nevertheless, confounding factors were not accounted for in the analyses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK> matched exposed with unexposed subjects but could not find suitable matches for the majority (60%) of their subjects. They could therefore only conduct analysis on the resulting 40% (139/346), which is an inappropriate and inefficient analysis. Some studies that reported on the issue of non-active licensed riders (<LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>) excluded non-active riders from analysis, introducing selection bias as it is likely that riders who continued to ride differed with regards to potentially confounding characteristics across intervention and control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>, for example, conducted several analyses to assess the effect of various sub-sets of the control group. Original analyses included all controls and led to erroneous results, since only a small proportion of controls had gone on to get a licence after their learner&#8217;s permit and were actually exposed to the possibility of experiencing a crash. Subsequent analyses compared only intervention and control subjects who had a licence. <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK> reported crashes by person-days of exposure but did not explain how they could be sure that each study intervention and control participant was an active rider and actually exposed to the risk of experiencing a crash.</P>
<P>Potential confounders that are unequally distributed by study arm at baseline need to be dealt with in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK> did not take into account any confounding factors, either by design or in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK> accounted for potential confounding factors at the design stage by matching the subjects in the intervention and control groups. Other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK> and also <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>) adjusted for one or two confounders by stratification or standardisation (e.g. crashes/miles driven, age group). <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK> conducted a univariate analysis of crash rates in which no potential confounders were accounted for, but also calculated cumulative crash rates by mileage travelled.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias in the case-control studies</HEADING>
<P>A case-control design is suitable for the assessment of risk factors for outcomes such as motorcycle crashes, injuries or deaths, but not appropriate for the evaluation of an intervention such as motorcycle rider training. It can potentially result in spurious conclusions regarding the efficacy of the intervention because the intervention has not been applied at random to an intervention and control group. Even with the control of possible confounders, using a case-control design to evaluate an intervention can lead to these kinds of results, since those who choose to undertake rider training may differ on important prognostic factors that affect the outcome, compared to those who do not choose to participate in rider training.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>A potential source of bias in case-control studies, as with all other study types where the intervention is not randomly allocated to participants, is that comparison groups are likely to differ on potentially confounding characteristics. This means that ideally all cases need to be included in the study as well as a random sample of controls taken from the population that gave rise to the cases. If that is not possible, cases and controls either need to be carefully matched to make them comparable, or differences at baseline need to be adjusted for in the analysis. All four case-control studies were population based. <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1975</LINK> included all fatalities and injured cases leading to hospitalisation, and appropriately recruited a random sample of controls from the same population. <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> did not manage to recruit all, or a random sample of cases. Only half of the notifications of crashes to the police were received in time by the researchers; the research team, for unreported reasons, was only able to respond to half of those again. Data collection was therefore completed for only about a fifth of all cases. Nevertheless, this was still a large sample of 900 cases. <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>, using a similar study design was more likely to have included all cases, but this is not entirely clear from the study reported. It is unclear for example whether fatalities were included, as they did not use coroner's reports for the recruitment of cases. The <LINK REF="STD-MAIDS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MAIDS 2004</LINK> study was conducted in five European countries but it was unclear how cases were recruited; whether they were all cases during the two years that the study lasted or a random sample of all cases; what the response rates were etc. Controls were recruited from randomly selected petrol stations but it was likewise not clear what the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study were, how they were recruited (e.g. randomly), and what the response rate was.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK> both matched controls to cases by recruiting them at the same time of day and same day of week as the crash occurred. <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK>, however, recruited controls two years later, and it is likely that there would have been differences between the two comparison groups. One important difference was that during data collection for cases, there was very little specialised motorcycle training available in the study region, whereas two years later, when control data were collected, there was some training available.</P>
<P>These four case-control studies also suffered from selection bias due to potential differences between those that gave consent to participate in the study and responded to interviews and questionnaires and those that did not. None of the studies have assessed such differences, although <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> did acknowledge that controls giving consent to cooperate may have differed from those motorcyclists who did not. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Measures that can be taken to reduce detection bias in case-control studies are: blinding of interviewers for case or control status; blinding of the participant for the study factor of interest; validating measurement instruments and using these in an identical way for cases and controls; and cross checking self-reported information with other, more objective sources such as registers. None of the studies reported blinding of the intervention assessors to case or control status but all used consistent measurement methods for both case and control groups.</P>
<P>All case-control studies used self-report as their main measure to assess whether cases and controls had received rider training and if so, the type of training. The major potential source of bias in case-control studies, when self-report is used as a measure, is recall bias. One way of reducing recall bias is by double-checking self-reported data with more objective data. <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1975</LINK> also used police accident reports for information on rider characteristics but such information was not available about rider training. <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MAIDS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MAIDS 2004</LINK> did not report on any measures to limit recall bias. <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> reported further questioning of cases by the interviewer when answers did not make sense or when participants seemed to contradict themselves as part of the in-depth unstructured interview technique. This qualitative research technique can result in valuable information, but as interviewers were not blinded to case or control status of the participants, it may have led to more thorough examination of cases compared to the controls, and thus differential detection bias.</P>

<P>The studies provided conflicting evidence regarding motorcycle rider training, which is likely due to the poor design, quality and reporting of the studies. Most of the studies included in the review were likely to be adversely affected by significant selection bias, along with substantial detection bias (measurement and recall bias) which limits our ability to make conclusive comments.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mandatory pre-licence rider training</HEADING>
<P>There were two RCTs, three cohort studies and one case-control study that examined pre-licence rider training. The two RCTs evaluated the Motorcycle Skills Operating Test (MOST) (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>).  <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> found a statistically significant reduction in <I>crashes</I> in the intervention group at six months, one and two years follow up. However, when only participants who obtained their licence were included in the analysis, the reduction was statistically significant only at one year follow up. The other RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>) found no statistically significant differences in crash rates at any point of time, neither in the total population group, nor in the licensed subgroup. Neither of the two cohort studies assessing crash rates found a statistically significant difference in crash rates between intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kloeden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kloeden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>) and the case-control study (<LINK REF="STD-MAIDS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MAIDS 2004</LINK>) also did not find a statistically significant difference in the odds of experiencing a crash, between trained and untrained riders. With regards to <I>offences</I>, neither of the RCTs found a statistically significant difference in offence rate between the intervention and control groups in the analysis of the total group of participants entering the trial. However, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> found a statistically significant increase in offence rates in the intervention group, but only after two years of follow up and only in the analysis of participants who obtained their licence. The two cohort studies assessing offence rates found no statistically significant difference between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrino 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the five studies (RCTs or cohort) found a reduction in crashes or offences following mandatory pre-licence rider training except for <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK> who observed a statistically significant reduction in crashes in the intervention group at one year in both analyses. It is not clear why both RCTs that evaluated the same MOST and training intervention observed different results. Both studies enrolled large samples, and observed a similar uptake of licensure following the intervention. It is possible that differences may have arisen due to different study samples (California versus New York) or that the intervention delivery differed between studies.</P>
<P>In both trials of the Motorcycle Skills Operating Test including rider training, only a third of motorcycle licence applicants obtained their motorcycle licence.  It is possible that a licensing process including a skills test may reduce crashes through decreased exposure. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Non-mandatory pre-licence training</HEADING>
<P>Three studies assessed the effect of non-mandatory pre-licence training. The <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1988</LINK> cohort study found no difference in <I>crash or offence rates</I> between the trained and untrained groups. We cannot however be confident about this result as the study suffered from selection bias which could have biased the measure of effect toward the null. The RCT conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Swaddiwudhipong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swaddiwudhipong 1998</LINK> examined <I>injury and death rates </I>and found a statistically significant lower injury rate in the intervention villages after one year of follow up but no longer at two year follow up. There was no statistically significant difference in death rates between intervention and control villages. Our confidence in the results of this study are hindered by the inadequacy of the randomisation process that led to significant differences between the intervention and control districts on two important variables. The intervention districts were more likely than the control districts to have a valid licence and to wear a helmet. Since these differences were not taken into account in later analyses they could explain the differences observed in injury rates between districts. Furthermore, with only six districts randomised, the sample size was probably too small to detect a difference between intervention and control groups, had there been one. The <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK> cohort study found a lower percentage of <I>injuries</I> in the intervention group, although a statistical test was not conducted. <LINK REF="STD-McDavid-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McDavid 1989</LINK> drew their intervention and control groups from different populations, but did adjust for confounders although they only analysed 40% of the initial sample (139 trained and 139 untrained). Because of these substantial weaknesses we are unable to draw conclusions from this study.</P>
<P>An overall effect of pre-licence training on the reduction of crashes, injuries, deaths and offences was not found although one should be aware that the research of this issue to date has had significant flaws. However, a mandatory skill test (such as the MOST) in combination with, and even without pre-licence training as part of a licensing process seems to reduce the number of individuals completing the licensing procedure, and therefore indirectly reduces crash rates through a reduction in exposure to motorcycle riding. Making licensure a more difficult process may therefore be seen as advantageous if it delays licensure and therefore reduces exposure. It is possible that the group who chose <I>not </I>to continue riding a motorcycle would not have been the group to experience a crash or commit an offence if they <I>had </I>continued to ride anyhow, for example because they are more safety conscious and this was the reason for their giving up riding in the first place. If this is the case, deterring individuals from completing their licence and riding may not necessarily decrease overall crashes, deaths or offence rates. In addition, other potentially adverse effects of complicating a licensing procedure need to be considered, such as increases in unlicensed riding. In Thailand, non-mandatory rider training offered as a community intervention may have decreased injury rates, but this needs to be confirmed through further research.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Non-mandatory training</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the studies assessed non-mandatory training (training independent of any licensing procedure) and the results were varied. The two non-randomised trials assessing <I>crash rates</I> found no statistically significant difference in crash rates between the intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Adams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>). Of the nine cohort studies, <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK> found a lower percentage of crashes in the intervention group, although it is unclear whether this was a statistically significant result; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK> also found a lower percentage of crashes in the intervention group although it is unclear with which control group the intervention group was compared; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK> found a statistically significant higher crash rate in the intervention group; and the remaining cohort studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Billheimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Billheimer 1998</LINK>) found no statistically significant difference in crash rates between intervention and control groups. No conclusions can be drawn from these studies with confidence. The <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1997</LINK> studies did not adjust for any confounding factors even though important differences existed between the intervention and control groups. Although <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK> adjusted for a number of confounders at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>) and in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1992</LINK>), the intervention and control groups were drawn from such different populations that it is possible that unmeasured confounders were responsible for the statistically significant increased risk of crashes observed in the intervention group. The observed difference could also be attributed to the observed differential loss to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1979</LINK>), which could bias the measure of effect towards or away from the null. The <LINK REF="STD-Osga-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Osga 1980</LINK> study found a protective effect of rider training in the univariate analysis, but statistically significant higher crash rates in the intervention group when accounting for riding exposure. Sex (a significantly higher proportion of females in the intervention group) and other potentially confounding factors that could explain the difference between the groups, were however unaccounted for. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Savolainen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Savolainen 2007</LINK> did control for potential confounding variables, yet it is not clear whether variables were controlled for simultaneously or one at a time. One case-control study (<LINK REF="STD-MAIDS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MAIDS 2004</LINK>) found no statistically significant reduction in the odds of experiencing a crash between trained and untrained riders but the quality of this study was poor, mainly because the analysis did not account for any confounding factors.</P>
<P>One cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>) assessed the effect of non-mandatory rider training on injurious crashes and found a lower percentage of <I>injuries</I> in the intervention group, although a statistical test was not conducted. As mentioned above, the <LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK> study&#8217;s validity is reduced due to its lack of adjustment for confounding factors. </P>
<P>The only non-randomised trial that assessed <I>offence rates</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK>) found a statistically significant lower offence rate in the intervention group, and of the five cohort studies that assessed offence rates (<LINK REF="STD-Satten-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Satten 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mortimer 1988</LINK>) one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK>) also found a statistically significant lower offence rate in the intervention group. However, we have little confidence in the results from <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1987</LINK> since potential confounding factors were not appropriately addressed.  <LINK REF="STD-Jonah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jonah 1982</LINK> did conduct a multivariate analysis but was hindered by an initial low response rate. The other four cohort studies did control for several potential confounders and found no difference in offence rates following non-mandatory post-licence rider training. </P>
<P>The non-randomised trials and cohort studies evaluating non-mandatory rider training were at high risk of substantial selection bias due to the non-random allocation of participants, as well as low participation rates and attrition bias, and could therefore not provide conclusive evidence with regard to the effect of the training. It should be noted that despite the biases and other issues with this group of studies, most did not detect major effects related to rider training in either direction. This may suggest that any potential impact of rider training will be modest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Studies examining unspecified modes of rider training</HEADING>
<P>Three case-control studies assessed whether injured or deceased motorcyclists were more or less likely to have had rider training compared to control motorcyclists. All had conflicting results. <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> found the odds of having an injurious crash was lower in those who had received rider training, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1975</LINK> found that the odds of having an injurious crash were higher in younger and older trained riders. <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>, who compared advanced versus beginner training, found no effect on motorcycle injuries or deaths, although they did find that those who had completed advanced training had reduced chances of crashing compared to those who had done a beginners' training course. Similar issues with uncontrolled confounding and biases of selection as described above, arose with the three case-control studies. <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> suffers from inadequate control of confounding via poor matching, and both the <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1975</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK> findings were only controlled for limited factors by means of stratified analysis. It is likely that these limitations are the reason for the contradictory directions of effect observed for the three case-control studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological weaknesses of the studies</HEADING>
<P>In summary, most studies investigating the effectiveness of motorcycle rider training on reducing crashes, injuries and death suffered from serious methodological weaknesses.</P>
<P>The majority of studies were non-randomised and were therefore limited mainly by selection bias. Although the approaches of matching, stratification, or regression analyses can minimise bias (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 2004</LINK>), they were poorly employed in the reviewed studies. The inadequate adjustment for confounders in particular, adds to our lack of confidence in the studies&#8217; results since it has been demonstrated that individuals who choose to take motorcycle rider training differ from those not taking rider training. For instance, trained riders often differ from controls in age, sex, and experience, usually ride less and may have a more positive attitude to safety as indicated by the reported more frequent wearing of seat belts (<LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two large randomised trials reported that a large proportion of their study group were never exposed to the risk of offences or crashes because they never attained licensure. This made it impossible to assess whether a reduction in crashes in the intervention group was a result of training, or due to delayed or never attained licensure.</P>
<P>In some studies the sample sizes were too small to detect any statistically significant differences. Follow-up time after training differed between studies and was an impediment to observing any real effects of training, if they existed. As riding experience accumulates over time, any differences in outcomes between those trained and untrained would diminish in studies with lengthy follow-up times. This dilution of any possible effect of rider training may have also occurred in studies that mixed both novice and experienced riders in the study groups since it is hypothesised that novice riders serve to benefit most from rider training. This would increase the difficulty in finding any effect of rider training, particularly when sample sizes are small. </P>
<P>Detection bias may also account for some of the differences observed between trained and untrained riders. Detection bias would have occurred if the self-report, hospital, driver, or police records used to record the outcomes of crash, injury, death or offences differed between the trained and untrained riders. Research has demonstrated that not all crashes are reported to police, for example small crashes or off-road crashes (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1975</LINK>); even serious injury crashes have been found to be underreported (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>). However, this would only introduce detection bias if the reporting of outcome differs for trained and untrained riders. This does appear possible in that responsible riders may be more likely to enroll in a rider training course and also may be more likely to report crashes to police than irresponsible riders, meaning that the number of crashes from riskier riders could be underrepresented on records. An analysis to investigate the effectiveness of rider training may then show that rider training is not effective in reducing crashes.</P>
<P>Rather than using reported outcomes, some studies used self-reported survey data, although this technique suffers from non-response biases. In fact, two studies reported differences in demographic characteristics in response rates to questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>). Self-reported data also introduce the risk of recall bias, survival bias and social desirability response bias. Recall bias may have been equally distributed among trained and untrained riders; however it is hypothesised that trained riders may have felt it was &#8216;expected&#8217; to report good driving histories, hence leading the rider training to appear effective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations of this review</HEADING>
<P>Limitations of this review were that we found very few recent studies (the two most recent ones published in 2002 and 2007) and that we found very few studies conducted in low-and middle income countries, even though our search strategy was set up to identify such studies. Another limitation was that, for the reviewed studies, we could not assess all outcomes of rider training that are potentially useful. Some of the included studies assessed outcomes such as use of safety clothing, including helmets. Such outcomes are valuable since the use of motorcycle helmets has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing head injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>). Despite this, the use of safety clothing was not included as an outcome in this review, because the studies measuring this outcome were limited by poor data quality due to very low response rates.</P>
<P>Another outcome of interest in assessing the effectiveness of rider training is &#8216;type of injury&#8217;. As <LINK REF="REF-Haworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haworth 2005</LINK> state in their review of motorcycle licensing and training, rider training could be considered effective if injuries become less severe because motorcycle riders have learned how to avoid more serious injuries through rider training. The studies included in this review did not specify type of injury and so this outcome could not be assessed. Last, changes in knowledge and attitudes following rider training are other potentially useful outcomes. We have excluded such studies (<LINK REF="REF-Osga-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osga 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clayton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenbeld-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenbeld 2004</LINK>) as these outcomes are proxies, rather than direct measures of the effectiveness of motorcycle rider training. We opted to report on the outcomes of crashes, injury, death and offences alone since there is little evidence about how changes in knowledge and attitudes relate to these outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-01-31 06:36:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the poor quality of studies included in this review, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of rider training on crash rates, injurious or fatal, or offence rates. The findings do suggest that mandatory pre-licence training may be an impediment to completing a motorcycle licensing process, thus possibly indirectly reducing crash, injury, death and offence rates through a reduction in exposure to riding a motorcycle. On the basis of the existing evidence it is not clear if, and what type of training reduces the risk of crashes, injuries, deaths or offences in motorcyclists and the selection of the best rider training practice can therefore not be recommended. The suggestion that mandatory pre-licence training indirectly reduces exposure to riding the motorcycle because trainees are impeded from completing the licensing process does not help those motorcyclists who persist in obtaining their licence and riding the motorcycle. Some type of rider training is likely necessary to teach motorcyclists to ride a motorcycle safely. Good policy is based on sound evidence and evaluation but such evidence for motorcycle rider training is seriously lacking. Policy makers are therefore encouraged to include a rigorous evaluation component to any new or existing rider training programme. Such an evaluation should ideally be randomized and assess whether the training programme is effective and if so, which component(s) of the programme work best.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-28 10:29:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the results of this review, which found little reliable evidence about the effectiveness of motorcycle rider training, it is necessary to build up an evidence base of the effectiveness of motorcycle rider training in the reduction of crash, injury, death and offence rates. To this end, well designed randomised controlled trials need to be conducted that examine the impact of rider training on crashes and offences. A randomised controlled trial is the preferred method as it would significantly reduce most biases described in this review. To minimise the impact of participants delaying or never attaining their licence and therefore exposure, as found in the randomised trials in this review, such a trial should include riders who are already licensed, and reliable measures of riding exposure in a reasonably lengthy follow up period. It is expected that a randomised controlled trial of sufficient sample size would observe equal balance on possible confounders by study arm, however an assessment of potentially important confounders (such as helmet wearing) by study group would enable control for these variables in the analyses if necessary. It is imperative that the effectiveness of each component of the rider training (such as theory, practice, knowledge, skills and modification of behaviour) and the synergy of such components are evaluated. Outcomes should be objective, ideally those that are routinely collected rather than self-reported outcomes. Even though riding the motorcycle poses different challenges and incurs different risks, lessons may be learned from research into the effects of car driver training.</P>
<P>Motorcycles are a common means of transport in low- and middle income countries and usage is increasing. As the burden of motorcycle crash victims is mostly borne in such countries, research should be focused on the effectiveness of types of rider training on the reduction of crashes, injuries and fatalities in such countries, and be supported by higher income countries. This review found only one study conducted in a middle income country that suggested decreasing injury rates. It would be beneficial to conduct additional research to confirm this suggestion and to enhance our knowledge of the role of rider training in low- and middle-income settings. </P>
<P>March 2006 saw the launch of the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Centre partnership with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), and plans were revealed to conduct a study of the potential benefits of motorcycle rider training. The study is funded by the MSF and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Called 'The Discovery Project', it will compare data on crash rates from riders participating in a basic motorcycle safety class with riders participating in a basic motorcycle safety class as well as a variety of continuing education classes. The collection of pilot data was due to start in March 2007 and the data collection portion of the study is expected to take three years (<A HREF="http://www.hsrc.unc.edu/directions/2006/spring/HSRC%20Directions%20-%20Spring%202006.pdf">Highway Safety Research Center</A>). It is vital that researchers and policy makers collaborate to develop further high quality evaluations of motorcycle rider training programmes to help inform development of new and effective training programmes.</P>
