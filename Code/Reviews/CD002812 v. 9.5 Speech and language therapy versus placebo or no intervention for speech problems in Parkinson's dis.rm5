<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:04:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people with Parkinson's disease suffer from disorders of speech. The most frequently reported speech problems are weak, hoarse, nasal or monotonous voice, imprecise articulation, slow or fast speech, difficulty starting speech, impaired stress or rhythm, stuttering and tremor. People with the condition also tend to give fewer non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions and hand gestures. These disabilities tend to increase as the disease progresses and can lead to serious problems with communication.</P>
<P>This review compared the benefits of speech and language therapy versus placebo (sham therapy) or no treatment for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of 16 medical literature databases, various registers of clinical trials and an examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews.</P>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. These were studies where two groups of patients were compared, one group had speech and language therapy, the other did not receive any therapy intended to improve speech. The patients were assigned to each of the groups in a random fashion so as to reduce the potential for bias.</P>
<P>Three trials with a total of 63 patients were found comparing speech and language therapy with an untreated group. The quality of the methods used in these trials was variable, with all studies failing in at least one critical area. All three of the controlled trials reported a positive effect of speech and language therapy for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Many of the outcome measures examined appeared to improve by a clinically significant amount after therapy. However, it should be noted that there were flaws in the methods used in these studies and only a small number of patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease were examined. This means that there is insufficient evidence to absolutely prove or disprove the benefit of speech and language therapy for the treatment of speech disorders in Parkinson's disease patients, but lack of evidence does not mean lack of effect.</P>
<P>A large well designed placebo-controlled randomised trial is needed to assess the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease should be chosen and the patients followed for at least six months to determine the duration of any improvement.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:04:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three randomised controlled trials with a total of 63 participants were found comparing SLT with placebo for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Data were available from 41 participants in two trials. Vocal loudness for reading a passage increased by 6.3 dB (P = 0.0007) in one trial, and 11.0 dB (P = 0.0002) in another trial. An increase was also seen in both of these trials for monologue speaking of 5.4 dB (P = 0.002) and 11.0 dB (P = 0.0002), respectively. It is likely that these areclinically significant improvements. After six months, patients from the first trial were still showing a statistically significant increase of 4.5 dB (P = 0.0007) for reading and 3.5 dB for monologue speaking. Some measures of speech monotonicity and articulation were investigated; however, all these results were non-significant.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:09:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although improvements in speech impairments were noted in these studies, due to the small number of patients examined, methodological flaws, and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively support or refute the efficacy of SLT for speech problems in Parkinson's disease. A large well designed placebo-controlled RCT is needed to demonstrate SLT's effectiveness in Parkinson's disease. The trial should conform to CONSORT guidelines. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease should be chosen and patients followed for at least six months to determine the duration of any improvement.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:04:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For definition of terms see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Glossary<BR/>Speech problems are common in Parkinson's disease and increase in frequency and intensity with progression of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Streifler-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streifler 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sapir-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapir 2001</LINK>). Dysarthria is a collective name for a group of speech disorders resulting from disturbances in muscular control of the speech mechanism due to damage of the central nervous system. It designates problems in oral communication due to paralysis, weakness or incoordination of the speech musculature (<LINK REF="REF-Darley-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darley 1969</LINK>). Common characteristics of Parkinsonian dysarthria are monotony of pitch and volume (dysprosody), reduced stress, imprecise articulation, variations in speed resulting in both inappropriate silences and rushes of speech, and a breathy hoarseness to the speech (hypophonia) reflecting the difficulty the patient has in synchronising talking and breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Logemann-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logemann 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995</LINK>). Many of these features are attributed to hypokinesia (paucity of movement) and rigidity which are considered to be cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mawdsley-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mawdsley 1971</LINK>). Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients also suffer from cognitive impairment which leads to difficulties in language selection, language understanding, coordination and dual tasks (talking and walking) as well as emotional intent and understanding. These issues do not come under the umbrella of dysarthric speech but impact on the ability of individuals to participate in spoken communication. As a result it was decided that the title of this review should be changed from &#8216;dysarthria&#8217; to include the full complexity of &#8216;speech problems in Parkinson&#8217;s disease&#8217;.</P>
<P>Four approaches to speech therapy are available: behavioural treatment techniques (drill, exercise), instrumental aids including prosthetic and augmentative devices, medication, and surgical procedures. Pharmacotherapy and surgery have a limited role in the management of specific motor impairments such as speech disorders, particularly those that emerge during later stages of the disease. It has been suggested that the behavioural treatment techniques of speech and language therapy (SLT) may be more effective in improving the intelligibility of speech in Parkinson's disease. Even then, "compensated intelligibility" rather than "normal speech" may be considered the more limited goal of SLT (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbek-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbek 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>A 2009 patient survey by Parkinson&#8217;s UK showed that only 34% of patients with Parkinson's disease in England reported receiving SLT (<LINK REF="REF-Parkinson_x0027_s-disease-society-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkinson's disease society 2008</LINK>). This low referral rate does not accord with the advice in most published guidelines which suggests that SLT should always be made available for the management of Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-NCC_x002d_CC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCC-CC 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review compared the efficacy of speech and language therapy with placebo or no intervention for speech problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. Another review will examine trials that compare two forms of SLT techniques.</P>

<P>Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of general biomedical and science databases: MEDLINE (1966 to 2011), PubMed (2010 to 2011) EMBASE (1974 to 2011), CINAHL (1982 to 2011), ISI-SCI ((1981 to 2011); rehabilitation databases: AMED (1985 to 2011), MANTIS (1880 to 2000), REHABDATA (1956 to 2011), REHADAT, GEROLIT (1979 to 2011); English language databases of foreign language research and third world publications: Pascal (1984 to 2000), LILACS (1982 to 2011), MedCarib (17th Century to 2000), Journal@rchive (19th century to 2011), AIM (1993 to 2000), IMEMR (1984 to 2011) and handsearching of appropriate conference proceedings. Relevant trials were included on the Group's specialised register of randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>2. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the CenterWatch Clinical Trials listing service, controlled-trials.com, ClinicalTrials.gov, RePORT, PEDro, NIDRR and NRR, were also searched for relevant trials.</P>
<P>3. The reference lists of located trials and review articles were searched.</P>
<P>4. Grey literature (e.g. conference abstracts, theses and internal reports) were searched. This included The International Congress on Parkinson's disease (1999, 2001), The International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 to 1998, 2002, 2004 to 2011), The American Academy of Neurology 51st annual meeting (1999) and the Congress of the European Federation of Neurological Societies (2003 to 2010). The following grey literature databases were searched: OpenSIGLE (1980 to 2011), ISI-ISTP (1982 to 2000), Proquest (1999 to 2011), Conference Papers Index (1982 to 2011) Ethos (1970 to 2011) and Index to Theses (1716 to 2011).</P>

<P>The review authors (CH, CT and CEC) independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy. Disagreements about inclusions were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>We contacted authors in the cases where further trial information was required for full analysis. Full papers were assessed for methodological quality by recording the method of randomisation and blinding, whether an intention-to-treat analysis was used, if an a-priori sample size calculation had been done, whether any selective reporting was apparent, the credibility of the placebo used and the similarity of the patients baseline characteristics as well as any loss to follow up. In addition we assessed whether patients remained on a stable drug regimen throughout the treatment period and follow-up, and if not whether any changes were fully disclosed.</P>
<P>Two authors (CH and CT) abstracted data onto standardised forms independently, checked them for accuracy and amalgamated the results. Disagreements about inclusions were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>We combined the results of each trial using standard meta-analytic methods (fixed-effect model) to estimate an overall effect for speech and language therapy intervention versus no intervention.</P>
<P>All relevant outcomes were continuous variables: for these the mean difference between treatment arms was calculated using weighted mean difference methods (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>). In summary, this involved for each trial, calculating the mean change (and standard deviation) from baseline to the post intervention time point for both the intervention and no intervention groups. The mean difference and its variance between arms for each trial could then be calculated. In some studies the standard deviation for the mean change was not reported. In these cases we imputed this standard deviation using the standard deviations for the baseline and final scores. To do this we used the following formula to estimate the variance of the change in score:</P>
<P>var<SUB>
<I>diff</I>
</SUB> = var<SUB>
<I>pre</I>
</SUB> + var<SUB>
<I>post</I>
</SUB> &#8211; 2r&#8730;(var<SUB>
<I>pre</I>
</SUB>var<SUB>
<I>post</I>
</SUB>
<I>)</I>
</P>
<P>where var<SUB>
<I>diff</I>
</SUB> is the variance of the change score; var<SUB>
<I>pre</I>
</SUB> is the variance of the baseline score; var<SUB>
<I>post</I>
</SUB> is the variance of the final score and r is the correlation between the pre- and post-treatment scores. We assumed a correlation coefficient of 0.5, which is a conservative estimate, to reduce the chance of false positive results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>These values were then combined using weighted mean difference methods to give the overall pooled estimate of the mean difference, with 95% confidence interval, for speech and language therapy versus no therapy (control). A result with a value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>: Characteristics of Included Studies and <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for PRISMA flow chart.<BR/>Three randomised controlled trials were found comparing speech and language therapy with placebo for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. A total of 63 patients were examined.</P>
<P>TRIAL DESIGN<BR/>All trials were parallel group, single centre studies.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>'s and <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK>'s baseline characteristics for both treatment and placebo groups had a high degree of similarity between the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> did not give the data on the four withdrawals, all of whom were in the control group. There was a difference of 10 years in the mean age of the two groups in this study.</P>
<P>INTERVENTIONS<BR/>There were significant differences in the duration and intensity of the therapy given to the patients. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> treated their patients for 10 hours over four weeks, <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> treated for 16 hours over four weeks and <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> treated for 35 to 40 hours over two weeks. All studies were conducted in an outpatient setting.</P>
<P>The methods of SLT differed in all of the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> gave the patients individual therapy with the emphasis placed on prosodic features of pitch and volume. Therapy was reinforced with the use of a number of visual feedback systems. <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> also aimed therapy at improving loudness and pitch variation but they also worked on respiration, voice production and intelligibility. Like <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>, they used visual feedback to reinforce the therapy, however, most of this therapy was carried out in a group setting with individual interventions carried out only where needed. The therapy in <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> aimed to maximize phonatory effort and loudness during speech with improved vocal fold adduction and overall laryngeal muscle activation and was carried out on an individual basis. This method was referred to as Lee Silverman Voice Therapy (LSVT).</P>
<P>CONTROL DESIGN<BR/>None of the three trials provided a description of the control intervention. In personal communications with the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> they stated that their control group was untreated. It is assumed that this was also the case in <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> but we were unable to contact the authors to confirm this.</P>
<P>OUTCOME MEASURES<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> provided no raw data on any outcome measure, and neither was this available from the authors. <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> reports the volume (synonymous to sound pressure level and loudness - see Glossary Table 1) of various modes of speech as well as measures of vowel articulation, including vowel formant frequencies and perceptual ratings of vowel goodness. The sound pressure level for reading a standard passage (the Rainbow passage) and for a monologue was comparable with the volume measured for these two activities in <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>'s study. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> also gave an overall assessment of speech quality using the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment and of the pitch of the speech in the measure of fundamental frequency.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> was the only study to carry out an extended follow-up to determine the longevity of any improvements. Measurements of volume were repeated for all patients six months after treatment.</P>
<P>EXCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>See Table: Characteristics of Excluded Studies.<BR/>We found twelve other trials and obtained the full papers to evaluate suitability of the trials for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Corte-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Corte 2009</LINK> was a focus group trial. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wohlert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wohlert 2004</LINK> did not adequately randomise participants.

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:04:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> for summary of the methodological quality of the trials.</P>
<P>Blinding of patients and treating therapists in trials examining the efficacy of SLT is not possible in practice. This leaves such trials open to performance and attrition bias. Performance bias could be due to factors such as the patients in the therapy group performing better due to placebo and Hawthorn effects, whilst attrition bias could be due to patients in the placebo group potentially being more likely to withdraw from the trial due to disappointment at not being placed in the active therapy arm. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>) used blinded raters which reduces the potential for detection bias. <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> offered treatment to everyone in the control arm at the end of the follow-up period: this may have reduced the potential for withdrawal from this arm of the trial.</P>
<P>RANDOMISATION METHOD AND CONCEALMENT OF ALLOCATION<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> used alternate allocation to randomise, which is not a truly random method. <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> used a &#8216;numbers pulled out of a hat&#8217; method of randomisation. Concealment of allocation cannot be confirmed when using such methods, thus selection bias cannot be excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> did not state their method of randomisation or concealment of allocation (see Glossary Table 1).</P>
<P>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA<BR/>The eligibility criteria for the trials were broad. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> did not state any eligibility criteria although it is implicit in the report that they only treated patients with Parkinson's disease. <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> required that all individuals in their Parkinson's disease groups had adequate hearing for daily communication and were on a stable drug regime. <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK>'s inclusion criteria stated that the participants must have Parkinson's disease and be on a stable drug regime.</P>
<P>It is vital that eligibility criteria are well defined so that it is understood what sort of a population were treated. For example, it is important that the Parkinson's disease accords with the UK Brain Bank Parkinson's Disease criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Gibb-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibb 1988</LINK>), otherwise it is more likely that individuals with Parkinson's plus syndromes will be included which have a significantly different clinical course compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</P>
<P>None of the trials stated explicitly that their patients had a speech deficit. However, it is highly unlikely that individuals were referred for therapy unless they had some form of speech problem. Defining the severity of the speech problem would have enabled an assessment of which patients benefit most from the therapy.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANT NUMBERS<BR/>A total of 63 patients were examined. With such a small number of participants, it is unlikely that they were truly representative of the Parkinsonian population as a whole. Overall only 18 of the 63 patients examined were female (29%), which introduces difficulties when trying to extrapolate the results of these trials to the general Parkinson's population.</P>
<P>SIMILARITY AT BASELINE</P>
<P>Considering the small number of patients in all of the studies, the likelihood of an unequal distribution is high, as demonstrated by the <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> study where the two groups differed in their mean age by 10 years. Differences like this suggest that the method of randomisation used was unsuitable.</P>
<P>The baseline characteristics of those patients who withdrew were not given in <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK>. Considering that the characteristics of these four individuals may have contributed to their withdrawal from the trial, it is important that this information should be available.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> gave an indication of the severity of Parkinson's disease within the groups. This makes it difficult to judge which patients would benefit most from the therapy and whether the results are generalized across the international Parkinson&#8217;s disease population. It is accepted that the Hoehn and Yahr score assesses physical disability and does not have a speech component; however, it has been shown that impairment in speaking ability increases in frequency and intensity with the progression of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sapir-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapir 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Streifler-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streifler 1984</LINK>
<LINK REF="REF-Sapir-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapir 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY<BR/>The methods of speech and language therapy were broadly described in the study publications. <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> provided a reference to a book (<LINK REF="REF-Ramig-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramig 1995</LINK>) that describes the LSVT method in greater depth. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> provided a schedule of events for each of the ten therapy sessions. <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> provided a brief description of the activities carried out during their therapy sessions. It is important that sufficient detail is provided so that the method of therapy can be repeated by other speech and language therapists.</P>
<P>The drug therapy of the patients was constant in <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> stated that drug therapy was constant for at least months prior to start of trial. It is important that drug therapy is kept constant for the duration of the trial as it has been shown that various drug therapies may affect speech quality (<LINK REF="REF-Biary-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biary 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dann-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION OF PLACEBO<BR/>None of the included studies used a placebo treatment. &#8217;No therapy&#8217; is an inadequate control for the speech therapy methods being studied as all the therapy groups were treated in an outpatients department of a hospital and therefore had to get up in time for their appointment, dress, travel, spend time in the company of other patients etc. None of this is speech and language therapy but it may have had an effect on the wellbeing and overall quality of life (Hawthorne effect) of the patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease who took part.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The data were analysed on a per protocol basis in <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> (see Glossary <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), this means that the analysis of the data could be biased if the drop-outs were due to the unacceptability of the placebo (as all of the drop-outs were in the placebo arm). There were four drop-outs in this study despite it only running for two weeks. No baseline information was given for these patients. It is assumed that <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis (see Glossary <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) as there were no withdrawals from these studies, though this was not stated in the publications.</P>
<P>None of the studies statistically compared the change in a given outcome measure (i.e. score after therapy minus score at baseline) between the two groups (i.e. change due to therapy versus change due to placebo). <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> statistically compared the final scores between the two therapy groups. This relies on the baseline characteristics of the two groups being very similar, but with such small numbers of participants, variations between the two groups at baseline are common. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> statistically compared the change in an outcome for each group individually over time. This means that this trial does not examine whether SLT is better than no treatment, only that changes, if any, occurred after a given therapy.</P>
<P>OUTCOME MEASURES<BR/>An analysis of the clinimetric soundness of the outcome measures used is included in the Discussion section of the review.</P>

</P>
<P>A total of 63 individuals were randomised into the three trials included in this review, no analysable data were available for the 22 patients from <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK>, this meant that the number available for numerical analysis was just 41. Both <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> compared mean values before and after the treatment. We converted these to mean changes from baseline and the mean differences between the groups were calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (95 % CI) and significance values (P).</P>
<P>SUMMARY ASSESSMENTS OF SPEECH IMPAIRMENT<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> measured total impairment with the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment, which improved significantly with therapy by 29.0 points (95% CI 13.7 to 44.3; P = 0.0002) compared to the no therapy group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> stated that the scores of the Dysarthria Profile were comparable in the two groups at baseline. Immediately after therapy the scores were significantly higher in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (ANOVA: F(1,16) = 3.85, P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS: LOUDNESS<BR/>See Glossary: <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for explanations of the various terms used to describe loudness.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> measured loudness objectively (sound pressure level, dB) with four different speaking modes, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> studied two speaking modes (volume, dB). Both <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> measured the mean loudness of a monologue. In <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> the patient chose the subject on which to talk, whilst in <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> the patients were given a list of subjects to select from. There was a statistically significant improvement in objective loudness of 11.0 dB (95% CI 3.98 to 18.02; P = 0.002) in <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> and 5.4 dB (95% CI 2.6 to 8.2; P = 0.0002) in <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> immediately after therapy. The results from these studies are combined in a forest plot in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>: although the treatment methods were not the same in these two trials the plot shows a significant improvement with therapy compared to no therapy of 6.17 dB (95% CI 3.57 to 8.77; P &lt; 0.00001). <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> continued to follow their groups for six months at which point the improvement in objective loudness had reduced to 3.5 dB (95% CI 0.9 to 6.1), but this was still a significant increase (P = 0.009). When the patients were asked to describe a picture in <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> the mean objective loudness of speech was also improved compared to baseline by 5.2 dB (95% CI 2.0 to 8.4; P = 0.001) more in the LSVT group than the no therapy group and this was maintained over six months (4.2 dB, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.3; P = 0.008). <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> both measured the mean objective loudness of reading a standard passage both of which improved by 6.3 dB (95% CI 3.5 to 9.1; P = 0.0007) and 11.0 dB (95% CI 5.2 to 16.9; P = 0.0002), respectively. These results were also meta-analysed in a forest plot, shown in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, the combined therapies gave an increase of 7.18 dB (95% CI 4.65 to 9.71; P = 0.00001) when compared with no therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> again recorded reading loudness six months after therapy and showed that this improvement was mostly maintained (4.5 dB, 95% CI 1.9 to 7.1; P = 0.0007). <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> also measured the mean objective loudness of a prolonged 'ah'. Again this improved after therapy by 12.1 dB (95% CI 8.9 to 15.4; P &lt; 0.00001) and the improvement was maintained for six months (9.4 dB, 95% CI 6.2 to 12.6; P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS: MONOTONICITY<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> measured two variables that could influence the monotonicity of speech and voice. Maximum pitch range was found by asking the patients to sing up and down to their highest and lowest notes. This improved by 66 Hz after therapy but the change was not significant (95% CI -4.4 to 136.6; P = 0.07). Maximum volume range was measured by asking the patients to count to five starting with the quietest voice they could achieve and ending with the loudest. There was a significant improvement of 23.7 dB (95% CI 9.3 to 38.1; P = 0.001) after therapy for this outcome.</P>
<P>SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS: PITCH<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> measured the mean pitch (fundamental frequency, see Glossary <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) of saying 'ah'. There was a non-significant difference of -65 Hz (95% CI -133 to 2; P = 0.06) between the two groups, with approximately 30 Hz of this change attributable to an increase in the placebo group.</P>
<P>OTHER OUTCOMES<BR/>No study provided any information on activities of daily living, intelligibility of speech, quality of life, adverse events, carer outcomes or performed an economic analysis.</P>

<LI>Three randomised controlled trials were found comparing speech and language therapy with placebo (63 participants); numerical data were only available in two of the trials (41 participants). These trials varied significantly in their methodology.</LI>
<LI>All of the trials claimed a positive effect of speech and language therapy on speech problems in Parkinson's disease. Many of the outcome measures examined appeared to improve by a clinically significant amount after therapy. However, considering the small number of patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease examined, the methodological flaws in the studies, and the possibility of publication bias, it is unsafe to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of speech and language therapy.</LI>

<P>Summary assessments of speech impairment<BR/>The Frenchay Dysarthria assessment has been validated for use with Parkinson's disease patients. Personal communication with the author of the scale has revealed that it is hard to determine whether a 29 point gain in the summary score is clinically useful. If the improvement was in areas associated with improvements in 'speech' it would be seen as clinically useful, however, if gains were in other parts of the test then they might not have a significant impact on the patient's communicative ability.</P>
<P>Speech impairments: loudness<BR/>Parkinsonian speech is often characterised by a quiet voice. This can exacerbate problems with intelligibility as listeners strain to hear what is being said by the patient. The tests can be divided into spontaneous and prompted speech. Spontaneous speech, such as a monologue or describing a picture is harder for people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease as it requires greater cognitive effort. However, it is more 'real life' than the prompted speech tests (reading or saying 'ah'). It can be suggested that with current computer technology it should be possible to record a conversation with a patient, remove the therapists' voice and then carry out vocal parameter analysis (volume, pitch etc.) on the patient's speech as it sounds in their most common speaking activity.</P>
<P>The objective loudness (volume or sound pressure level measured in decibels with a microphone) of the patients&#8217; speech improved, with all types of speech modality measured, after therapy. The size of these improvements had reduced a little after six months. When considering whether these improvements are clinically useful it is helpful to examine <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK>'s study. In addition to the therapy and placebo groups of Parkinson's disease patients, they also examined 14 healthy, age matched people with no speech or voice impairments. When the objective loudness of their speech is compared to the total Parkinson's disease group (therapy and placebo combined) at baseline, averaged over all four of the outcomes assessed, the healthy participants spoke 2.8 dB louder. All of the improvements immediately after therapy in the patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease are at least twice as large as this, and even at six months later all of the improvements in loudness are more than 3.5 dB. Therefore, this suggests that these increases in the loudness of speech are useful to the participants. However, as the patients and their carers were not asked whether they felt that their speech had got louder and/or more intelligible, it cannot be said what impact these improvements had on the patient's communication abilities.</P>
<P>Speech impairments: monotonicity<BR/>It is accepted that a patient's maximum loudness and pitch variation will have an impact on the monotonicity of their day-to-day conversation. It would have been more useful to measure the objective loudness and pitch variability in a sample of speech, however, it is recognised that at the time of the <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> study the technology may not have been easily available.</P>
<P>Speech impairments: pitch<BR/>The only measure of pitch of the patient's speech was measured by asking them to say 'ah'. This is a highly artificial situation, and the standard deviations were quite large which may explain why the pitch reduced in the therapy group, when therapy would have been aimed at increasing pitch.</P>
<P>Activities of daily living (ADL)<BR/>It is important to assess the impact that poor communication has on the ADL of patients with Parkinson's disease. For example, many patients have difficulty using a telephone or talking to strangers. If after therapy they found that these skills improved, this could also reduce their sense of isolation and so probably also increase their quality of life.</P>
<P>Adverse Events</P>
<P>Adverse events were not reported by any of the trials included in this review. Although the risk associated with speech and language therapy is low, patients could be affected by vocal strain or abuse during high effort exercises</P>
<P>Quality of life (QOL) and intelligibility<BR/>It is now generally accepted that quality of life measures should be used as the primary outcome of interest in larger clinical trials to provide a global patient-orientated perspective on an intervention. However, with speech and language therapy it could be argued that the primary outcome of interest is improved intelligibility. At present quantifying this multi-factorial outcome is difficult and there are few validated scoring systems that assess this outcome. One available system is the Assessment of Intelligibility for Dysarthric Speech (AIDS), which quantifies single-word intelligibility, sentence intelligibility, and speaking rate. None of the trials reviewed used QOL or intelligibility scales. Therefore, the trials reported here cannot be used to inform sample size calculations for future trials.</P>
<P>Depression<BR/>The effectiveness of the therapy could potentially be affected by depression. Depressed patients could be less compliant both during the therapy sessions and also in the practice at home. The therapy itself might affect depression. The patient's mood may improve due to the attention they are being paid by the therapist, by getting out of the house and meeting other people. A well designed placebo intervention would control for the non-therapeutic confounders. If the therapy affected the patient's physical well-being so that they felt more in control and able to carry out more of their ADL independently, this could improve the patient's mood. Also it is important to measure depression, as a number of surveys (<LINK REF="REF-GPDS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">GPDS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karlsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Visser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visser 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 2004</LINK>) have found depression to be the main contributor to reduction in quality of life due to Parkinson's disease.</P>
<P>Carer outcomes<BR/>Approximately 75% of Parkinson's disease patients live with a partner, who is usually of a similar age and may have disabilities of their own (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 1999</LINK>). The impact of caring for a person with Parkinson's can be severe (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Reilly-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Reilly 1996</LINK>), and it would be hoped that an intervention such as speech and language therapy could have a positive effect on the carer's life as well as the patient's. It is also important to assess the carer's perception of the speech impairment as they are usually the ones that have the greatest interaction with the person with Parkinson's disease.</P>
<P>Health economics<BR/>No health economics analysis of speech and language therapy has been performed, which precludes an understanding of the economic value of this therapy. If we can prove that SLT works, we then need to persuade health care purchasers to buy the service. They need to know whether it is cost neutral or whether it increases or decreases the overall costs of care and whether this is balanced by improvements in efficacy.</P>
<P>SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY METHODOLOGY<BR/>There is no consensus amongst therapists on which SLT method to use or whether it should be a combination of methods. A recent survey of speech and language therapists in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2011a</LINK>) showed a high proportion of patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease referred for SLT receive only an assessment, advice and review service. When treatment methods were employed, voice quality was most commonly addressed with LSVT or other vocal loudness exercises and intelligibility was treated with pacing/rate control exercises supported by work on loudness. Psychosocial and language strategies were rarely employed by the therapists surveyed despite these being flagged as important reasons for referral. Over 75% of all therapists surveyed wanted further training and over half of these specifically desired training in LSVT techniques. As part of the same study a survey of SLT provision was carried out with patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease and their carer&#8217;s (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2011b</LINK>). Of the 83 patients who had received any treatment from a speech and language therapist, 56% had their sessions in a local clinic or hospital outpatients setting and 37% were visited in their own home. Median duration of therapy for those treated was four weeks with 68% attending a single weekly session, a further 22%, who were predominantly receiving LSVT, had four or more therapy sessions per week. Most sessions (80%) lasted between 30-60 minutes.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review highlights the fact that there is insufficient trial evidence to support any form of SLT for speech problems in Parkinson's disease. Lee Silverman Voice Therapy (LSVT; <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK>) concentrates solely on volume with participants being encouraged to 'think loud'. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> used a more traditional multi-dimensional approach, both using visual feedback. They used vocal drills to improve the patients' overall speech quality and their perception of their speech.</P>
<P>SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY TERMINOLOGY<BR/>The terminology in this review has been aimed at a general clinical audience unlike some of the trial reports. It is hoped that this will improve understanding by non-speech and language therapists. In an attempt to make reading the original reports easier we have included a glossary in this review (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: Glossary).</P>
<P>The same outcome measure was often labelled differently in different trials (e.g. volume and sound pressure level), which adds further to the confusion. It was also difficult for a non-specialist to determine the value of any given change in the vocal characteristics measured in these trials. Care should be taken when writing reports of speech therapy outcomes that an association is made with the direction and size of change in a given measure and its impact on the communication ability of the patient. For example, pitch range (fundamental frequency variability) is important because Parkinsonian speech tends to drift towards a monotone with none of the pitch variations that are important in conveying the sense of a phrase.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:04:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY<BR/>Methodological quality and standard of reporting was poor. However, two of the three studies were published before the CONSORT guidelines were published (1996).</P>
<P>The trials used insufficient numbers of participants to avoid reaching false negative conclusions and to reduce the possibility of selection bias. Only 29% of the patients enrolled into the trials were female. This is in contrast to the general population of Parkinson's disease patients where the prevalence of the disease is evenly divided across the sexes (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 1996</LINK>). This is a common finding in Parkinson's disease trials but raises questions as to whether the results can be generalized across the whole Parkinson's disease population and to women in particular.</P>
<P>The method of randomisation was not stated in <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>. Alternate allocation was used in <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramig 2001</LINK> picked numbers out of a hat, both of which are fallible as these methods are not truly random and allocation is not concealed.</P>
<P>All three trials failed to clearly define their disease of interest or state their inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is vital that eligibility criteria are well defined so that it is understood what sort of a population were treated. For example, it is important that the Parkinson's disease accords with the UK Brain Bank Parkinson's Disease criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Gibb-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibb 1988</LINK>). This will reduce the likelihood of including individuals with Parkinson's plus syndrome which have a significantly different clinical course compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The eligibility criteria should also define the severity of Parkinson's disease and the speech problems in those eligible to participate, and state clearly any exclusion criteria such as dementia. This would allow an easier assessment of the applicability of the results in real clinical situations.</P>
<P>It is recognised that inclusion of credible placebo arms in rehabilitation therapy trials is more challenging and expensive than in drug trials. A control arm receiving &#8216;no therapy&#8217; leaves both the therapist and the patient unblinded which could lead to performance bias. It is important, therefore, to include control groups which account for time and attention given to active therapy groups. People with Parkinson's disease are frequently socially isolated and the attention paid to them could have a significant impact upon their mood and perception of their disability. However, it is recognised that a 'placebo' therapy may be impractical to apply in large multicentre trials and that an untreated 'best medical practice' group would represent a less than adequate comparator. Although the estimate of the size of improvement due to therapy would be more difficult to determine because of the placebo effect, which is estimated at around 16% in Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Goetz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetz 2008</LINK>), this design may be more reflective of current therapy provision and practice.</P>

<P>Improvements in speech impairments were noted in the 41 participants evaluable from these studies, though it cannot be stated whether or not these changes were of a clinically useful magnitude. Considering the methodological flaws in many of the studies, the small number of patients examined, and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of speech and language therapy for speech problems in Parkinson's disease.</P>

<LI>To obtain proof of the efficacy of speech and language therapy for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease patients large randomised placebo-controlled trials are required. A rigorous method of randomisation should be used and the allocation adequately concealed. Data should be analysed according to intention-to-treat principles. The trial should be reported according to the guidelines set out in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 1996</LINK>). This review emphasises many methodological shortcomings in the three trials of speech and language therapy versus placebo for speech problems in Parkinson's disease. The issues arising from this review have a significant bearing on the conduct of future speech and language therapy trials in Parkinson's disease and other conditions:-</LI>
<LI>         firm diagnostic criteria should be used (e.g. UK Parkinson's Disease Brain Bank Criteria) (<LINK REF="REF-Gibb-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibb 1988</LINK>); </LI>
<LI>         inclusion and exclusion criteria should be clear and trials should aim to enrol uniform cohorts of Parkinson disease patients;</LI>
<LI>         investigators should clarify at what stage of the disease speech and language therapy is being evaluated; </LI>
<LI>         trials must have sufficient numbers of participants to avoid false positive or false negative conclusions;</LI>
<LI>        ideally trials should include an adequate placebo control groupalthough it is recognised that an untreated 'best medical practice' group may be more practicable;  </LI>
<LI>         trials must include a very clear description of the therapeutic intervention;</LI>
<LI>         patients should be followed for at least six months after treatment to assess any long-term effects of the SLT intervention;</LI>
<LI>         for some scales, trials should report whether scores on impairment and disability refer to the 'on' or 'off' phase;</LI>
<LI>         suitable clinimetrically sound outcome measures should be chosen so that the efficacy and effectiveness of SLT can be assessed and an economic analysis performed. Outcomes which have meaning to Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients and carers should be used wherever possible since they need to know the value of SLT in practical terms;  </LI>
<LI>         the data must be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and the change in an outcome measure must be compared statistically across the two therapy groups;</LI>
<LI>        associations between size/direction of changes in outcome measures and the ability of the patients to communicate should be made, with intelligibility used as a key outcome measure to facilitate this.</LI>

<TD>
<P>DEFINITION</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Amplitude</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The maximum absolute value of a periodically varying quantity. For a sound wave, the maximum variation in pressure relative to static conditions (e.g. atmospheric pressure). Small variations produce weak (or quiet) sounds whilst large variations produce strong (or loud) sounds. (See loudness below).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Articulation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The production of vowels and consonants using both the moving parts of the mouth (e.g. tongue and lips) and the fixed structure of the mouth (e.g. hard and soft palate). It does not involve the voice box.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Concealment of allocation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The process used to conceal foreknowledge of group assignment, which should be seen as distinct from blinding. The allocation process should be impervious to any influence by the person making the allocation. Adequate methods of allocation concealment include: centralised randomisation schemes (telephone randomisation) or sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Decibel (dB)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A unit used to express relative difference in power or intensity, usually between two acoustic or electric signals, equal to ten times the common logarithm (i.e. base 10) of the ratio of the two levels. i.e. 10 log10 (W2/W1) where W1 is the reference power level and W2 is the quantity being specified in dB relative to W1. It is commonplace to want to express in decibels, quantities that are related not to power, but power squared. Examples include sound pressure and voltage. In such cases the expression for the decibel level becomes 20 log10 (p2/p1). So that individual quantities can be specified, default reference values are defined for sound pressure (20x10E-6 pascals), sound power (10E-6 watts) and sound intensity (10E-12 watts per square meter). For other quantities (e.g. voltage) a value of unity is often used implicitly. The reference level for sound pressure (corresponding to 0 dB) was originally set as an approximation to the threshold of human hearing. A whisper has an intensity of ~30 dB, normal speech ~60 dB, a shout ~90 dB and a jet aircraft ~120 dB.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Dysarthria</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Dysarthria is a collective name for a group of speech disorders resulting from disturbances in muscular control of the speech mechanism due to damage of the central nervous system. It designates problems in oral communication due to paralysis, weakness or incoordination of the speech musculature.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Dysprosody</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Abnormal prosody (see prosody). Loss of the 'melody' of speech.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Frequency</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The number of complete cycles of a periodic process occurring per unit time. For sound waves this is the number of times the pressure variation cycle occurs in one second. The unit used to measure frequency is the hertz (Hz) (see below).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Fundamental frequency (F0)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The fundamental frequency is the inverse of the period (T0); i.e. F0 = 1/T0. For complex sounds such as speech, F0 will normally correspond to the frequency of the lowest harmonic. It is measured in hertz (see below). The aim of S&amp;LT is to increase the fundamental frequency of Parkinsonian speech as this leads to improved intelligibility. See also Pitch (see below).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Fundamental frequency variability</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The variation in fundamental frequency (see above) of speech. Measured as the standard deviation of F0 in hertz or semitones (STSD). The aim of S&amp;LT is to increase F0 variation and thus decrease the monotonicity of the patient's speech. See also Pitch.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Hertz (Hz)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Hertz is the unit of frequency expressed in cycles (sound waves) per second.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Hypophonia</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A breathy hoarseness to the speech.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Intelligibility</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Degree of clarity with which utterances are understood by average listeners. It is influenced by articulation, rate, fluency, vocal quality and intensity (see below).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Intensity (of sound)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The sound power propagating through a unit area of the sound field in a given direction. For example, the sound intensity of a point source radiating spherical waves and of a given sound power, will diminish as the distance from the source is increased, in proportion to the inverse of the square of this distance (1/distance squared). It is a vector quantity since it specifies both a magnitude and direction, therefore direct measurement is not straightforward. Sound intensity has units of watts per square metre, but can also be expressed in decibels (see above). Sound intensity is related to the square of the sound pressure, but the exact relationship depends on the characteristics of the sound field.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Intention-to-treat data analysis</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Data are analysed according to the randomisation allocation, irrespective of protocol violations and withdrawals. Withdrawals, and therefore missing data points, are usually compensated for by using the last observation carried forward. Intention-to-treat analyses are favoured in assessments of effectiveness as they mirror the non-compliance and treatment changes that are likely to occur when the intervention is used in practice and because of the risk of attrition bias when participants are excluded from the analysis.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Loudness</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Loudness is usually the subjective impression of the level of a sound. However, in the text of this review we have also mentioned 'objective' loudness. We define this as being loudness measured mechanically, see intensity, sound pressure level and decibels. The subjective loudness of a sound is defined as being relative to the perceived loudness of a 1000 Hz tone generating a sound pressure level of 70 dB. Loudness is influenced by frequency, level and waveform shape and is governed by the physiology of the ear. It is measured in units of phons. Typically, an increase in sound pressure level of 10 dB results in a doubling of loudness. However, at low levels of loudness, the increase is more like 6 dB for a corresponding perceived change. Loudness is sometimes also referred to as volume.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Monotonicity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A lack in variation of both loudness (see above) and pitch (see below).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Period (T0)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The length of each sound wave (cycle) in time is called the period of a waveform. It is equal to 1/frequency.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Per protocol data analysis</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Data are analysed according to what therapy the patients received, rather than according to their randomised allocation. Withdrawals are removed from the analysis. This form of data analysis risks attrition bias.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Phonation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The mechanism of producing sounds with the vocal chords.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Pitch</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The perceptual correlate of frequency (see above). Normally, the pitch of a complex sound is a function of its fundamental frequency (see above). Equal steps in pitch are roughly equal to logarithmic steps in amplitude.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Prosody</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Prosody is defined as that aspect of spoken language which consists in correct placing of pitch and stress on syllables and words. It is responsible for conveying subtle changes of meaning independently of words or grammatical order. In addition to this semantic role, it makes a major contribution to the emotional content of speech.</P>

<P>So that individual quantities can be specified in terms of decibels, default reference values are defined for sound pressure (20x10E-6 pascals), sound power (10E-6 watts) and sound intensity (10E-12 watts per square meter). For other quantities (e.g. voltage) a value of unity is often used implicitly. The reference level for sound pressure (corresponding to 0 dB) was originally set as an approximation to the threshold of human hearing. However this equivalence has since been questioned.</P>

<TD>
<P>Sound pressure and Sound pressure level (SPL)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Sound pressure is the root mean square (r.m.s) variation in pressure from the static value (e.g. the atmospheric pressure) and is measured in pascals. The r.m.s variation in pressure from the static value (e.g. the atmospheric pressure). Sound pressure is measured in pascals, but can be expressed in decibels (see above), 20 log10(sound pressure/20x10E-6) whereupon it is referred to as sound pressure level. Sound pressure is a scalar quantity and is therefore relatively easy to measure: for example, a microphone responds to sound pressure. The reference level for sound pressure (corresponding to 0 dB) was originally set as an approximation to the threshold of human hearing. However, this equivalence has since been questioned.</P>
