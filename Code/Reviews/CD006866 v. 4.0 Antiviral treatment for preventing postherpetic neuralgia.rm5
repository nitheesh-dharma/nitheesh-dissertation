<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antiviral medicines for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>PHN is a painful condition that can occur after shingles (herpes zoster) in the area where the rash occurred. Many people with PHN find that treatments work only a little or not at all. Attention has therefore turned to stopping the development of PHN. Some people suggested that medicines that target the virus that causes shingles (antiviral medicines), given at the time of the rash, might prevent PHN. The aim of this review was to assess the whether antiviral medicines are able to prevent PHN.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified six clinical trials that met our standards for inclusion in the review. They included a total of 1319 participants. We decided that our main measure of whether antiviral medicines work in preventing PHN would be whether or not PHN had developed six months after a first attack of shingles (some of the studies we included of aciclovir measured PHN at four months).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Aciclovir, which is an antiviral medicine, was used in five trials (900 participants) and was not better than a placebo (dummy pill) in preventing PHN. In the other trial (419 participants), famciclovir, which is another antiviral drug, was no better than placebo in preventing pain following healing of the shingles rash. The number of side effects with aciclovir and famciclovir was not very different from the number with placebo. The trials did not have any major problems of design or conduct that put the results in doubt, although most of the reports did not provide enough information to fully assess every aspect. We conclude that according to high quality evidence, oral aciclovir was ineffective in reducing the incidence of PHN and there is not enough evidence on other antiviral treatments. There need to be further well-designed trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents with a greater number of participants. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should include different groups of people, such as those who have lowered immunity.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to April 2013, when the searches were last updated. Because new evidence on this topic is slow to emerge, we have scheduled the next update of this review for 2017.</P>

<P>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful and refractory complication of herpes zoster. Treatments are either partially or totally ineffective for many people with PHN.

<P>On 26 April 2013, we updated the searches in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System. We checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials, and contacted authors to obtain additional data. We searched other databases in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> for information for the Discussion and two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.</P>

<P>Six RCTs with a total of 1211 participants were eligible; five trials evaluated oral aciclovir, and one, with 419 participants, evaluated oral famciclovir. We were able to conduct meta-analyses as there were sufficient similarities in the included studies, such as the reporting of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation and treatment regimen. For our primary outcome, based on three trials (609 participants) we found no significant difference between the aciclovir and control groups in the incidence of PHN four months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.11), nor was there a significant difference at six months (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, two trials, 476 participants). In four of the trials (692 participants), there was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain four weeks after the onset of rash. In the trial of famciclovir versus placebo, neither 500 mg nor 750 mg doses of famciclovir reduced the incidence of herpetic neuralgia significantly. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache for aciclovir, and headache and nausea for famciclovir. For neither treatment was the incidence of adverse events significantly different from placebo. None of the studies were at high risk of bias, although the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain for all but one study. We found no new RCTs when we updated the searches in April 2013.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-28 21:02:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments; therefore, further well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate famciclovir or other new antiviral agents in preventing PHN. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-03 17:17:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-03 17:17:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a condition of persistent pain in the area previously affected by acute herpes zoster infection (shingles). Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which is usually dormant in the cranial sensory and spinal dorsal root ganglia after the onset of chicken pox (<LINK REF="REF-Gnann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gnann 2002</LINK>). Immunosuppression, aging, physical and emotional stress, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can trigger reactivation of VZV. People who have received an organ transplant and those receiving chemotherapy and steroid therapy are also susceptible to VZV (<LINK REF="REF-Fillet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fillet 2002</LINK>). The incidence of herpes zoster ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 per 1000 person years, and rises steeply with age; fewer than one per 1000 person years in children and as many as 12 per 1000 person years in those aged over 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2001</LINK>). The normal age-related decrease in cell-mediated immunity is thought to account for the increased incidence in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Stankus-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankus 2000</LINK>). Herpes zoster is initially characterised by a prodromal phase that is associated with pain and paraesthesia in the affected dermatome. Hours to days later, a papular rash appears and progresses to vesicles, then pustules, and finally crusts and heals three to four weeks later. In some people, the pain persists for weeks, months or years after the rash has healed; this is called PHN.</P>
<P>PHN is the most common complication of herpes zoster. Although PHN has been defined in different ways, data support the distinction between acute herpetic neuralgia (within 30 days of rash onset), subacute herpetic neuralgia (30 to 120 days after rash onset), and PHN (defined as pain lasting at least 120 days from rash onset) (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Desmond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmond 2002</LINK>). In a prospective study, PHN with a pain intensity of 4 (rated on a 0 to 10 scale, 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated very severe pain) was rare (<LINK REF="REF-Thyregod-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thyregod 2007</LINK>). Accordingly, the severity of pain needs to be considered in trials and in this systematic review. Age was an important risk factor for PHN. Forty per cent of individuals older than 50 years and 75% of adults 75 years and older develop PHN after VZV infection and experience the same burning, incapacitating pain endured during the herpes zoster infection (<LINK REF="REF-Portenoy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portenoy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2001</LINK>). Pain often leads to depression, fatigue, insomnia, altered activities of daily living and decreased socialisation. Individuals may also experience anorexia, physical inactivity and difficulty concentrating (<LINK REF="REF-Schmader-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmader 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-02 16:28:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Owing to the severity and complexity of the disease, treatment is initiated at the onset of the rash and may be necessary for months, or even years. Treatments with established efficacy for the treatment of the pain of PHN include gabapentin, lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, pregabalin and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hempenstall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hempenstall 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Attal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 2006</LINK>). However, for many people these medications are either partially or totally ineffective, whether administered alone or in combination. With insufficient good quality evidence, there is no recommended first-line topical or systemic management in the treatment of PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Khaliq-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaliq 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2009</LINK>). Therefore, attention has turned to approaches that may prevent the development of PHN and antiviral agents are the best-established.</P>
<P>Eradication of varicella with a vaccine should result in fewer cases of herpes zoster because the incidence of reactivation of the vaccine is lower than that of the virus. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the Shingles Prevention Study, SPS) showed that a VZV vaccine administered to adults, 60 years of age or older, reduced the incidence of herpes zoster and PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 2005</LINK>). However, a recent Cochrane systematic review, which included the SPS trial, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove the efficacy of the vaccine for preventing PHN, beyond its effect on reducing herpes zoster (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>). Further, the vaccine is given to healthy people, not people with herpes zoster. A Cochrane review has found another potential therapy, corticosteroids given acutely during herpes zoster infection, to be ineffective in preventing PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-03 17:17:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>VZV is a highly contagious DNA virus. It is thought that VZV passes to the dorsal root ganglion via the skin during the initial infection (chicken pox) and lies dormant. Although the pathophysiology of PHN remains unclear, pathological analysis of ganglia from people with PHN has revealed diffuse and focal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1991</LINK>). The detection of VZV DNA and proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of people with PHN further supports the notion that low-grade viral ganglionitis contributes to PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Vafai-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vafai 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahalingam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahalingam 1995</LINK>). If chronic pain reflects active infection, there may be a rationale for aggressive treatment with antiviral agents to prevent PHN. The antiviral agents inhibit VZV replication and accelerate cessation of viral shedding, hasten rash healing, and reduce the duration of acute pain (<LINK REF="REF-Gnann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gnann 2002</LINK>), but their roles in preventing PHN remain controversial.</P>
<P>Many studies have demonstrated no benefit from aciclovir in reducing the duration or incidence of PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Kost-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kost 1996</LINK>). However, two meta-analysis studies of all placebo-controlled trials with aciclovir for herpes zoster suggested a significant reduction in zoster-associated pain in people who received aciclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1997</LINK>). In 2000 a systematic review suggested, from the limited evidence then available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), that early treatment of acute herpes zoster with famciclovir or valaciclovir started within 72 hours of rash onset for seven days might reduce PHN incidence or duration (<LINK REF="REF-Alper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alper 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-28 20:39:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been numerous trials and reviews to assess the effects of various antiviral treatments for preventing PHN; however, their results have been inconsistent and we still have no clear evidence. We therefore carried out this Cochrane systematic review. The review was first published in 2009 and we updated the searches in 2013.</P>

<P>We undertook the task of analysing the data using RevMan 5 and reported them according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. We calculated a treatment effect using a fixed-effect model across trials with RevMan 5. We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), risk differences with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes and as mean differences for continuous outcomes. If studies used differing follow-up periods, we rescaled the results or expressed them as effects/unit time to allow for this. If the difference in effect with the standard error was available, but the standard deviations of the individual study groups were not, we used the RevMan generic inverse variance facility to pool studies.</P>

<P>We found many studies of antiviral treatment for acute zoster, but only a few studies addressed relevant end points, such as the incidence and duration of PHN or the associated pain after the acute phase. Among the studies, six trials with a total of 1211 participants were suitable for inclusion.</P>
<P>The reports of all included studies explicitly stated Inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the studies recruited adults with the characteristic rash of herpes zoster that had been present for 72 hours or less. One study was limited to people over 50 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>), while another study involved people over 60 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>); the other trials only required adults to be older than 16 to 20 years. Sample sizes differed between trials, ranging from 46 to 419 participants (three studies had more than 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>)). Each trial reported the demographic characteristics of participants, including gender distribution, mean age and mean duration of rash before enrolment; they recorded no significant differences. Altogether, 580 males and 614 females were included in our review (discrepancies in the number of participants were due to occasional missing items of data in some trials). More than 831 (69%) participants were 50 years of age or older. The locations of rashes were reported in several trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>), and one trial enrolled people with acute herpes zoster ophthalmicus only (<LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>). Common exclusion criteria across the trials included: immunosuppression; pregnant or nursing women; hepatic or renal dysfunction; systemic glucocorticosteroid therapy or any antiviral therapy; people who required immunosuppressive therapy; cancer; and the presence of crusts on herpetic lesions at enrolment. No trial evaluating the efficacy of antiviral treatment for people who were immunocompromised met the inclusion criteria for our review.</P>
<P>Oral aciclovir was the most commonly used antiviral treatment for herpes zoster, and five of the six studies evaluated its effect, with treatment commencing within 72 hours of the zoster rash. These five studies used oral aciclovir at a dose of 800 mg five times daily: two studies administered the antiviral for seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>), two studies administered the antiviral for 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>), and the remaining study administered the antiviral for 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK> additionally studied a 400 mg dosage five times per day for 10 days. <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK> randomised participants to aciclovir, prednisone, both aciclovir and prednisone, or neither aciclovir or prednisone, for 21 days.</P>
<P>In the sixth included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>), participants were assigned to one of the following regimens: famciclovir 500 mg, famciclovir 750 mg or matched placebos, identical in taste and appearance three times daily for seven days from within 72 hours of onset of the rash. All aciclovir trials followed the participants for six months or longer after enrolment, while in the famciclovir study participants were followed for five months after the lesions healed. Follow-up included the following approaches: participants returned to see the physician at a prescribed time or as often as clinically necessary (<LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>); investigators contacted participants by telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>); or a research nurse or assistant assessed the participants at home (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>). The remaining trial did not describe the method of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). The six trials reported loss to follow-up and withdrawal, but one trial did not refer to the reasons for loss to follow-up or withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>). Only two trials stated that an intention-to-treat analysis was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>), which was not described in the other trials.</P>
<P>The outcome measures differed between the trials. All the included trials reported the presence or duration of PHN, which was defined with different cut-off times and intensities of pain. Severity of pain was referred to as a separate outcome in several trials, but measured in different ways: specifically, <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK> used a VAS set vertically at 100 mm, and compared pain scores directly between groups, while <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK> recorded pain by asking participants to mark a linear scale ranging from 'none' to 'very severe', and for analysis, translated the mark on this linear scales to a score of zero to three by quartering. In the other trials, the intensity of pain was only evaluated as 'absent', 'slight', 'moderate', or 'severe', and was often recorded in the acute phase only. Quality of life was measured in <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK> and included the times to cessation of acute neuritis, return to uninterrupted sleep, and return to 100% usual activity, but it was only evaluated during the first month after disease onset. None of the trials reported quality of life measured with the SF-36 after six months. All included trials reported adverse events during treatment, or within two weeks of stopping treatment. Adverse events were categorised as 'serious' or 'not serious'.<BR/>

According to the summary assessment of the risk of bias for each important outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>), we rated one of the trials as at a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>), rated five of the trials as at an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>), and none were at a high risk of bias.

The Huff, Whitley and Wood studies used a computer-generated randomisation code to randomly assign participants to the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>, the laboratories of the centre conducting the trial provided each course of study medication in a numbered and randomised bottle. <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK> did not describe the method of randomisation.

<P>All of the six included trials were double blind, using placebo in the control group. Most of the trials used matching placebo identical to the active drug, but only described blinding in broad terms, such as 'double blind,' which made it impossible to know exactly who was blinded (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).

Further all the outcomes, including persistence and severity of pain and adverse events, were participant-reported, so the risk of bias from knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel during the study or by outcome assessors was low in those two trials, but there was insufficient information for the other four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>) to make an assessment.</P>

<P>We also considered performance bias due to use of other treatment measures. Exclusion criteria usually ruled out people on other relevant treatments from the studies but in some trials, other conventional medications, such as corticosteroids, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, topical preparations and antidepressants, were permitted during treatment and follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-02 17:32:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiviral treatment has been widely used to accelerate the resolution of herpes zoster and its complications. The differing results from relevant trials and reviews of the efficacy of antiviral treatment for preventing PHN prompted the present systematic review of RCTs. We have done our best to collect and extract all possible data to conduct a more complete systematic analysis.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-02 17:32:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six randomised controlled trials that addressed relevant endpoints for treatment of PHN, five of which compared oral aciclovir with a control treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>), and the sixth oral famciclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>). Despite different designs, methods, duration of follow-up, and efficacy end points, sufficient similarities (such as reports of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation (less than 72 hours), and treatment regimen) meta-analysis was possible. Based on a limited number of studies, the result indicated that antiviral treatment did not have a significant effect on the incidence of PHN after four or six months compared to placebo (three studies after four months (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994</LINK>), and two studies after six months (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>)). <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> shows the main findings, including key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of oral aciclovir and the sum of data on the main outcomes. The incidence of PHN, reported in some natural history studies, was 10% to 50%, according to different definitions of PHN and different possible risk factors for its development such as age, prodromal pain, ophthalmic zoster and immunocompromised state (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stankus-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankus 2000</LINK>). In trials included in this review, the incidence of PHN in placebo groups was 11% to 60%, which might be considered as the natural incidence of PHN. The incidence in treatment groups was similar at 12% to 58%.</P>
<P>Although studies defined PHN in several ways, opinion supports the definition of pain lasting at least 120 days from rash onset (<LINK REF="REF-Desmond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmond 2002</LINK>), and in this way we partitioned pain lasting 30 to 120 days after rash onset as subacute herpetic neuralgia. As an additional outcome measure, we extracted all data about herpetic neuralgia from one month after the onset of the rash. The meta-analysis showed a slight but significant reduction in the incidence of pain in the aciclovir group compared with the placebo group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96). This finding is consistent with the benefit reported in some controlled trials from antiviral treatment for acute herpes zoster (<LINK REF="STD-Cobo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cobo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKendrick-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKendrick 1986;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Wassilew-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wassilew 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared to the incidence of PHN, which was the main focus in this review, measures of severity of pain and quality of life can help assess the efficacy of treatment for preventing PHN. However, only a few trials addressed these measures. One trial reported significantly lower mean VAS pain scores in the aciclovir than in the placebo group at two to six months (<LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK> concluded that no significant difference existed in any aspect of quality of life between the aciclovir plus prednisone-placebo and the double placebo group, as evaluated by the times to return to uninterrupted sleep, 100% usual activity and total cessation of the use of analgesic agents, but without any validated scale. Similar information was not obtainable from the other trials.</P>
<P>There were no serious adverse effects attributable to the experimental therapy reported during treatment, or within two weeks of stopping treatment. Adverse effects were not significantly more common amongst the antiviral than the control participants.</P>
<P>Additionally, we analysed important demographic prognostic variables that might have had an impact on the results in subgroups. Although we obtained insufficient information to undertake the subgroup analysis for a different duration of rash before treatment initiation (24 hours or less versus longer than 24 hours), we did an evaluation of the efficacy of oral aciclovir according to the age of participants, and it did not show a significant benefit either in those older or younger than 50 years of age.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-02 15:46:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the included trials addressed relevant endpoints for PHN and adverse effects, but data regarding the severity of pain and quality of life were limited. The types of participants allowed us to draw conclusions only for people who are immunocompetent. Our analysis does not include people who were immunocompromised, which is a population at high risk for herpes zoster and PHN, because we did not find any eligible trials evaluating the efficacy of antiviral treatment in this group. Because of insufficient data, we did not assess the effects of antiviral treatment starting sooner rather than later after the onset of herpes zoster.</P>
<P>We included none of the intravenous antiviral treatment trials because follow-ups were limited to assessment of efficacy during the acute phase, so the trials did not address the incidence of PHN.</P>
<P>Thus, the results of our review were limited to oral antiviral agents (aciclovir and famciclovir) and immunocompetent people with herpes zoster. These results do not provide evidence of efficacy on outcomes such as pain severity and quality of life.</P>
<P>In the opinion of the authors, since antiviral treatment is still widely used for acute and subacute herpes zoster, it is important to inform patients that PHN might still develop despite antiviral treatment in the early phase, because the relationship between acute inflammation, pain and PHN is not simple or clear.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-28 20:45:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All six included trials were randomised, controlled parallel studies. However, we rated only one trial as good quality, because of its design and efforts to avoid selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other bias. We rated the others as fair, since they had an unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains, commonly for allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, or incomplete outcome data. Hence, the identified evidence did not permit a totally robust conclusion to be reached on the efficacy of antiviral treatment for preventing PHN.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-12-28 20:45:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Different definitions of PHN and different time points for measures between trials hampered the extraction of data. Although we tried to collect all relevant data at several cut-off times, the possibility of missing data remained. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK> defined PHN as pain after rash healing, and followed participants up monthly for five months thereafter. We have contacted the author for the primary data but have not yet received a reply.</P>
<P>We have done our best to search the pertinent literature, including published and unpublished studies, without any language restrictions, and we contacted the investigators to obtain additional information as required. As there were too few studies, we did not use a funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias, but used a descriptive analysis to evaluate the possible reporting bias. There is still a need, however, to take publication bias into account because most of the included studies were published in English, and trial authors did not provide enough useful information in response to enquiries. To reduce the risk of attrition bias, the meta-analyses were of the intention-to-treat population.</P>

They conducted a pooled analysis of four trials of recommended doses of oral aciclovir versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Huff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Huff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harding-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 1991</LINK>), and calculated that the incidence of PHN at six months was reduced by 42% in the participants treated with aciclovir. However, we could not substantiate from the original trials the incidence rates reported in the <LINK REF="REF-Crooks-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crooks 1991</LINK> review.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of the same four trials performed by Wood and colleagues indicated a significant reduction of at least 50% in the prevalence of PHN at three and six months among aciclovir recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1996</LINK>). However, the meta-analysis seemed not to include <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1988</LINK>.</P>
<P>The most recent systematic review reviewed several approaches including antiviral treatment for preventing or shortening PHN (which was defined as any pain after healing of cutaneous zoster) (<LINK REF="REF-Alper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alper 2000</LINK>). Alper and co-workers also included the four above-mentioned placebo-controlled trials of oral aciclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Alper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alper 2000</LINK>), providing marginal evidence for a reduction in the incidence of PHN at one to three months; and one trial of oral famciclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Tyring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tyring 1995</LINK>), concluding that it significantly reduced the duration, but not the incidence of PHN. The conclusions are partly in agreement with our review. However, <LINK REF="REF-Alper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alper 2000</LINK> only performed a descriptive analysis without a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A review of famciclovir for herpes zoster included the only famciclovir trial in the present review, besides three comparative trials of famciclovir and aciclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1998</LINK>). It suggested a slight benefit of famciclovir for reducing the incidence of post-zoster pain, and showed no statistically significant difference between famciclovir and aciclovir in terms of efficacy or tolerability.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-02 15:52:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-28 20:46:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not significantly reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, defined as pain lasting 120 days or longer from rash onset. There was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain in the short term, that is four weeks after the onset of rash. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of other antiviral agents for preventing PHN.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-02 15:52:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials of aciclovir would be inappropriate, but well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, comparing them to aciclovir and with a greater number of participants, are needed to evaluate the efficacy of these antiviral agents in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Future investigators should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life, and should consider different subgroups, such as the immunocompromised. The effects of antiviral treatment started sooner rather than later after herpes zoster onset should be stratified for assessment. Moreover, the quality of reporting should be improved, so that more useful data can be obtained.</P>

<P>An additional outcome measure, the presence of herpetic neuralgia one month after the rash onset, which was not specified in the protocol, was reported in the review. The authors changed the inclusion criteria to exclude quasi-RCTs, because RCTs are thought to be the only way to prevent systematic differences of baseline characteristics between intervention groups, according to the latest <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.</I> However, no quasi-RCTs were found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). In this update we added a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>

<P>New evidence on this topic is slow to emerge. The next scheduled update of this review will be four years from the date of search rather than the usual two years. However, if we become aware of new data before the update is due, we will plan an earlier update.</P>
