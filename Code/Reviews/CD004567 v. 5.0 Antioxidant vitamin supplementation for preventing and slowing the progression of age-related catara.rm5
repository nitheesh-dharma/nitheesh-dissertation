<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-26 11:35:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A cataract occurs when the normally clear lens in the eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are the leading cause of correctable reduced vision worldwide. Most cataracts develop slowly with normal aging. However, cataracts also may be related to genetic diseases and medical conditions such as diabetes. Other factors such as poor nutrition, sun damage, radiation, corticosteroids, smoking, alcohol, eye trauma or other eye surgery may influence cataract formation.</P>
<P>Mild or early cataracts may not impair vision. In some cataracts, new eye-glass prescriptions, brighter lighting or magnifying lenses may overcome the vision losses. When these interventions fail to improve poor vision due to cataracts, surgical removal (extraction) is the generally accepted effective treatment. However, cataract surgery is associated with some risks. The estimated annual costs for outpatient, inpatient and prescription drug services related to the treatment of cataract is USD 6.8 billion.</P>
<P>Antioxidant vitamin supplementation has been studied as a means to prevent the formation or to slow the progression of cataract. Results from observational studies have been inconsistent.</P>
<P>The review authors searched for randomized controlled trials in which supplementation with the antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene (provitamin A), vitamin C and vitamin E was compared to inactive placebo or no supplement. Nine trials involving 117,272 adults of age 35 years or older were included in this review. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland, India, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States and were of high methodological quality. The doses of antioxidants given in each trial were higher than the recommended daily allowances. The trials provided no evidence of effect of the antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene, vitamin E and vitamin C given alone or in combination on the incidence of cataract, its extraction or progression and on the loss of visual acuity. Some participants (7% to 16%) on beta-carotene developed yellowing of the skin (hypercarotenodermia).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Cataract is the opacification of the normally transparent lens in the eye. Cataracts might be congenital or hereditary, associated with certain risk factors and systemic diseases, or caused by toxins and drugs or physical trauma.</P>
<P>Most cataracts develop slowly as a consequence of aging. The pathogenesis of age-related cataract is multifactorial and not completely understood. Important risk factors in addition to age include diabetes mellitus, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, use of corticosteroids and recreational drugs such as nicotine and alcohol. The formation of cataract is accelerated in ocular trauma, vitreoretinal surgery, uveitis and diabetes mellitus. Oxidation reactions in the lens, both as a consequence to normal aging and those triggered by UV radiation, are believed to be potent etiological factors in the development of cataract (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The earliest opacities may appear anywhere within the body of the lens; the processes that culminate in poor vision vary depending upon the site of initiation. Thus, age-related cataract is classified into three major types: nuclear, cortical and posterior subcapsular. Among these, cigarette smoking has been linked with nuclear cataract whereas corticosteroid use and trauma have been linked with posterior subcapsular cataract (<LINK REF="REF-Wevill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wevill 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Age-related cataract is the leading cause of blindness in the world. It accounts for 17.7 million (47.8%) of the total 37 million cases worldwide. It is even more significant as a cause of low vision and is the leading cause of low vision in all the World Health Organization sub-regions (<LINK REF="REF-GDVI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GDVI 2004</LINK>). In the United States, an estimated 20.5 million (17.2%) people older than 40 years have cataract in one or both eyes, with the prevalence expected to rise by 50% to 30.1 million in 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women have a higher risk of being visually impaired than men. The worldwide prevalence ratio of female to male visual impairment ranges from 1.5 to 2.2 (<LINK REF="REF-GDVI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GDVI 2004</LINK>). In the United States, women have higher age-adjusted prevalence of cataract than men (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>). The odds of cataract were 75% (odds ratio (OR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 2.56) and 35% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.49) higher among black and white women respectively when compared to men (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>). The prevalence increases with age and the overall global burden is expected to rise with increases in life expectancy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>Recent data on the costs related to management of cataract worldwide are unavailable. In the United States, healthcare costs for individuals over age 65 are partially covered by Medicare. Cataract surgery, IOL implantation, and other cataract-related costs amount to about 60% of all Medicare expenditures related to vision (<LINK REF="REF-Ellwein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellwein 2002</LINK>). It is estimated that the direct annual medical costs for outpatient, inpatient and prescription drug services related to the treatment of cataract total USD 6.8 billion (<LINK REF="REF-PBA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">PBA 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions for cataract</HEADING>
<P>The symptoms of early cataract can possibly be improved with the use of new eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare glasses or magnifying lenses. However, surgical extraction is the only effective treatment for cataract (<LINK REF="REF-Leyland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2006</LINK>). There are no medications, eye drops, exercises or glasses that have been proven to be effective in preventing the formation or slowing the progression of cataract in the otherwise healthy aging adult eye.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-04-26 11:30:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Supplementation with vitamins with antioxidant properties such as beta-carotene and vitamins C and E have been proposed as candidate interventions to prevent or slow progression of cataract.</P>
<P>Beta-carotene is a red-orange fat-soluble compound abundant in fruits such as mangoes, papayas, carrots and yams and in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and leaves of sweet potato and sweet gourd. It is a provitamin converted by the body to active vitamin A which has antioxidant properties. Vitamin A plays an important role in vision and is also needed for bone development, testicular and ovarian function, embryonic development and maintenance of mucosal and epithelial surfaces. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults has been established by the U.S. Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. There are no RDA for beta-carotene. The RDA for vitamin A is 900 micrograms retinol (3000 International Units (IU)) for adult males and 700 micrograms retinol (2300 IU) for adult females. One microgram of retinol is equivalent to one Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE). One RAE is equivalent to 2 micrograms all-trans-beta-carotene as a supplement or 12 micrograms of all-trans-beta-carotene in the diet. Deficiency of vitamin A can cause night blindness, xerophthalmia (dry eyes), dermatological problems and impairment of immune response.</P>
<P>Vitamin C is a water-soluble compound present in milk and animal products such as liver and fish; vitamin C is abundant in vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits such as oranges. It is important in the synthesis of collagen and carnitine and for neurotransmitter and cholesterol metabolism; it has antioxidant properties. The RDA for vitamin C is 90 mg for adult males and 75 mg for adult females. Deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy.</P>
<P>Vitamin E is a fat-soluble compound found in a variety of foods including oils, meat, eggs and leafy vegetables. Vitamin E has antioxidant properties and works as a free radical scavenger, protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), a major structural component of the cell membranes, from peroxidation. The RDA for vitamin E is 15 mg (22.4 IU) for adolescents and adults. Deficiency of vitamin E can cause neuromuscular disorders, lysis of red blood cells and impairment of immune response.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-04-26 11:30:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oxidation of lens proteins and mitochondrial function are key factors in cataract pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Wevill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wevill 2008</LINK>). Beta-carotene is known to be an effective antioxidant at low partial pressures of oxygen, as exists in the lens (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1984</LINK>). Vitamin C is located in the aqueous compartments of lens membranes where it may function as an antioxidant and protect enzymes in the lens from photo-oxidative destruction (<LINK REF="REF-Blondin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blondin 1986</LINK>). Vitamin E is lipid soluble and concentrated in the lens fibers and membranes and may inhibit cataract formation by reducing photo-peroxidation of lens lipids and by stabilizing lens cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Karslioglu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karslioglu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Libondi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libondi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohta-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varma-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varma 1982</LINK>).</P>

<P>Laboratory and epidemiologic evidence linking oxidative stress to cataract formation have led investigators to assess the role of antioxidant intake in the development of age-related cataract. Several observational studies have noted protective associations for various antioxidants. However, in totality, the evidence from the large number of observational studies that have examined this association (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chasan_x002d_Taber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chasan-Taber 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cumming-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumming 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hankinson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankinson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IACS-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">IACS 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacques-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacques 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacques-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacques 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacques-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacques 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacques-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacques 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knekt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knekt 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuzniarz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuzniarz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leske-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leske-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leske-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leske 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leske-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mares_x002d_Perlman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mares-Perlman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mares_x002d_Perlman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mares-Perlman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mares_x002d_Perlman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mares-Perlman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarty-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarty 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nadalin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadalin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rouhiainen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouhiainen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seddon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seddon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tavani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tavani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vitale-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshida-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshida 2007</LINK>) is inconsistent.

We evaluated the trials for the following criteria: sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), masking of care providers and recipients of care (performance bias), masking of outcome assessors (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias) and other sources of bias (intention-to-treat analysis, equivalence of baseline characteristics and adherence to treatment). We reported the judgment for each criterion as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear (information is insufficient to assess). We resolved disagreements through discussion. We contacted authors of the trials for additional information on issues that were unclear based on information available in the original report. In case of failure to communicate with the primary investigators, or if there was no response within six weeks, we assessed the methodological quality on the basis of the available information.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-APC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">APC 2006</LINK>, the progression of the three major types of age-related cataract was assessed separately. The primary outcome was change in nuclear opalescence from baseline as clinically evaluated by slit lamp using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) criteria. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline of nuclear color, cortical and posterior subcapsular opacities using the LOCS III criteria. The results were presented as difference in slope between the groups (with 95% CI) from generalized estimating equations.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>, the three major types of age-related cataract were assessed separately. Progression was defined in terms of events; a cortical event was defined as a change from baseline of 10% of the area of a standard central 5 mm circle; a nuclear event was defined as a change in opacity from baseline of 1.5 U and a posterior subcapsular event was defined as a change from baseline of 5% of the area of a standard 5 mm circle. "Any lens event" included any of the above events or incident cataract surgery. "Severe lens event" included changes of 20% for cortical, 2.5 U (units/steps) for nuclear, 20% for posterior subcapsular cataracts. Slit lamp photographs were used to grade nuclear opacities and retroillumination photographs were used to estimate the area of involvement for cortical and posterior subcapsular opacities. The results were presented as odds ratios (with 99% CI to account for multiple comparisons) from repeated measures logistic regression. For "any and severe lens event" both unadjusted and adjusted (for age, race, sex, baseline smoking status, age-related macular degeneration category) results were presented.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK>, the primary outcome measure was increase in percent pixels opaque in the digital, anteriorly focused retroillumination image. Progression of cataract was defined as the difference between the last value and baseline value in percent pixels opaque. The three major types of age-related cataract were assessed separately using the LOCS III criteria: LOCS III C grade for cortical, LOCS III NO grade for nuclear and LOCS III P grade for posterior subcapsular cataract. The results were presented as mean of the last value, mean of change from baseline (with P values from analysis of variance) and as regression models from generalized estimating equations.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2004</LINK>, the progression of the three major types of age-related cataract was assessed separately. Lens opacities were assessed clinically using the Wilmer Lens Grading system and objectively using masked grading of photos taken with the NIDEK lens camera. Progression was defined as (Wilmer Lens Grading System) an increase in cortical opacity by one grade or more, nuclear opacity by 0.5 of a grade or more and posterior subcapsular opacity by 1 mm<SUP>2</SUP> or more. As stated earlier, the change in grade had to be maintained for two consecutive years to be considered as progression. The results were presented as unadjusted risk ratios (with 95% CI).</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-APC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">APC 2006</LINK>, visual acuity was evaluated using the National Eye Institute Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution) chart using standard methodology. The results were presented as change in BCVA from baseline (with standard deviation) at the end of the study.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>, loss of visual acuity was defined as decrease in BCVA score from baseline of 15 or more letters which is equivalent to doubling of more of the initial visual angle. Visual acuity was measured every six months and was measured according to the ETDRS protocol. The results were presented as unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (adjusted for age, race, sex, baseline smoking status), with 99% CIs from repeated measures logistic regression.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK>, visual acuity was presented as mean of the last value and mean of change from baseline (with P values from analysis of variance) on the logMAR scale. Visual acuity was assessed approximately every four months.</P>

<P>The four trials that examined progression of cataract, regardless of designation of type, did not find any evidence of effect for either vitamin E alone (<LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2004</LINK>) or all three antioxidants in combination (<LINK REF="STD-APC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">APC 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK>). Progression of cataract was defined differently in these four trials. In <LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK>, though the effect estimate for progression of cataract (as the primary outcome) favored antioxidant supplementation as reported by the authors, their finding should be interpreted with caution because of the high attrition rate in the trial. Moreover, the test of statistical significance for this outcome yielded a probability considered "borderline." None of the effect estimates for progression of cataract (as secondary outcomes) were statistically significant. Additionally, the results by type of cataract were not statistically significant. In <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2004</LINK>, the non-statistically significant increase in progression of cataract (RR 2.5, 95% CI 0.6 to 11.2) and the non-significant decrease in incidence of cataract (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.1) in the subgroup of posterior subcapsular cataract should be interpreted with caution because of the low event rates and very small sample size.</P>
<P>The three studies that examined loss of visual acuity did not find any evidence of a beneficial effect for all the three antioxidants in combination (<LINK REF="STD-APC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">APC 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK>).</P>

The doses of antioxidant supplementation were higher than the RDA in all trials.</P>
<P>This systematic review of world literature suggests that there is no evidence of effect of the antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E on the incidence of cataract, incidence of cataract extraction, progression of cataract or loss of visual acuity. Several characteristics of the populations of these studies are noteworthy. Firstly, these studies included only those aged 35 years or older. It is possible that supplementation should be started at an earlier age to demonstrate a beneficial effect. Secondly, the protective effect of antioxidant vitamins perhaps may take decades of intake to manifest. Thirdly, all the included studies except <LINK REF="STD-APC-2006" TYPE="STUDY">APC 2006</LINK> were done in the developed world on apparently healthy individuals. The nutritional status of these individuals could be quite different from those in the developing world. Lastly, there are many different types of antioxidants, some natural and some synthetic, and the conclusions drawn here should be limited to supplementation with beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E only. It is possible that there are other antioxidants that are beneficial in relation to age-related cataract.</P>
<P>Though this systematic review did not find any protective effect for antioxidant vitamin supplementation, its results should not be extrapolated to imply that consumption of fruits and vegetables which are rich in antioxidant vitamins and other substances is not beneficial. The included studies used supplements in doses that were higher than the RDA for these antioxidant vitamins. It is possible that these doses are toxic. Fruits and vegetables contain safe amounts of antioxidants; only high levels of antioxidants that result from supplementation could be detrimental.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that beta-carotene may be a co-carcinogen (<LINK REF="REF-Paolini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paolini 2003</LINK>). In this review, hypercarotenodermia (yellowing of skin) was observed in 7% or more of those taking beta-carotene among the participants of <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ATBC-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ATBC 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PHS-I-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PHS I 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2004_x002f_8" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2004/8</LINK>. There was a statistically significant 6% increase in epistaxis among those taking vitamin E in participants of <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2004_x002f_8" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2004/8</LINK>. Additionally, studies have shown that beta-carotene used as a single agent or in combination with vitamin A and vitamin E either had no effect or a statistically significant increase in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caraballoso-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caraballoso 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vivekananthan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vivekananthan 2003</LINK>). In the light of no evidence of effect for beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E supplementation with respect to cataract and visual acuity and with evidence of adverse effects for beta-carotene and vitamin E, recommendations for use should be made with a great degree of caution. It should be noted that as with beneficial effects, adverse effects for these antioxidant vitamins and adverse effects of other antioxidants may require decades of intake to manifest.</P>
<P>The use of antioxidant vitamin supplementation by the general population of western countries is probably high. According to data from the Women's Health Initiative more than half the women were taking antioxidants in some form (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2003</LINK>). In view of the lack of evidence of a protective effect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation and the increase in risk associated with its use, great efforts should be made to educate physicians and the public about their potential deleterious effects. The ease of availability of these antioxidant vitamins over the counter and aggressive marketing strategies make awareness of these issues a pressing public health necessity.</P>

<P>We have been able to demonstrate, with high-quality evidence, the failure of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in preventing and slowing the progression of age-related cataract.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-REACT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">REACT 2002</LINK>) was judged to be at 'high risk of bias' (for incomplete outcome data) with respect to the parameters of quality assessed in this review.
