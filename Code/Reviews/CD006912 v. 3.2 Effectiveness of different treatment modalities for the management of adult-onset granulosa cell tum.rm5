<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary are rare ovarian tumours (2% to 5% of all ovarian cancers). Most ovarian tumours arise from the outer surface layer of the ovary, but GCTs arise from granulosa cells (sex cord cells) within the ovaries that produce oestrogen (primary female sex hormones). These tumours grow relatively slowly and can recur 10 to 15 years after primary treatment. If women with these tumours want to have children, the surgeon usually removes only the diseased ovary. However, standard treatment has consisted of surgery to remove tubes, ovaries and uterus, as most women develop GCTs around the time of the menopause, when fertility is no longer a matter of concern.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Previous studies have assessed chemotherapy (different combination regimens) with or without radiotherapy following surgery. This review aimed to examine the effects of various treatment methods, including fertility-sparing surgery, on the survival of women with GCT of the ovary.</P>
<P>
<B>Main findings</B>
</P>
<P>Five retrospective studies (including 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Two studies, which attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), suggested that no apparent evidence could be found of differences in overall survival between surgical approaches (including whether the surgery was keyhole or open) whether a patient underwent lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all women combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study.</P>
<P>One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent only surgery. In three studies, no apparent evidence to suggest that disease recurrence was associated with type of adjuvant chemotherapy or type of surgery, although surgical staging may be important. In one study, disease recurrence was not noted to be different between patients who underwent fertility-sparing surgery, where only the affected fallopian tube and ovary were removed, and those treated with conventional surgery, in which both tubes and ovaries were removed. Given the high overall survival rate, fertility-sparing surgery may be an important treatment option for young patients wishing to have children in the future. Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study.</P>
<P>Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life. All studies were at very high risk of bias (low quality).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All five studies were retrospective (looked at past findings) and were at very high risk of bias (low quality); therefore future studies should look at current evidence in randomised studies on adult GCT of the ovary. Three randomised studies comparing chemotherapy are ongoing. The study that may be able to answer the question regarding best choice of chemotherapy in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised study comparing the efficacy of two drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus standard chemotherapy (BEP - bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin).</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence in this review is of low quality, which may seriously weaken confidence in the results. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on evidence provided in the future. The effectiveness and safety of different ways of treating patients with adult-onset granulosa cell tumour of the ovary have not yet been assessed by high-quality studies. Such trials are required to assess toxicity and quality of life associated with different treatments and to assess the safety of the types of surgery used. Generally, current evidence is not robust enough to allow recommendations for changes in clinical practice.

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:16:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Granulosa cell tumour is a rare gynaecological tumour of the ovary with recurrences many years after initial diagnosis and treatment. Evidence-based management of granulosa cell tumour of the ovary is limited, and treatment has not been standardised. Surgery, including fertility-sparing procedures for young women, has traditionally been the standard treatment. Adjuvant treatments following surgery have been based on non-randomised trials. A combination of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) has traditionally been used for treatment of advanced and/or recurrent disease that cannot be optimally managed surgically.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:16:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment modalities offered in current practice for the management of primary, residual and recurrent adult-onset granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:16:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 2013. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:16:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and observational studies that examined women with adult-onset granulosa cell tumours of the ovary (primary and recurrent). For non-randomised studies, we included studies that used multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline characteristics.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:16:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to treatment comparisons, so data were not synthesised in meta-analyses, and methods for assessing heterogeneity were not needed. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed by using the six core items used to assess RCTs and by evaluating four additional criteria specifically addressing risk of bias in non-randomised studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-16 09:04:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Five retrospective cohort studies (535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) that used appropriate statistical methods for adjustment were included in the review.</P>
<P>Two studies, which carried out multivariate analyses that attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), reported no apparent evidence of a difference in overall survival between surgical approaches, whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all participants combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study.</P>
<P>One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent surgery alone (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 0.6, P value 0.04). Three studies reportedthat there was no evidence of differences in disease recurrence based on execution and type of adjuvant chemotherapy or on type of surgery or surgical approach, other than that surgical staging may be important. One study described no apparent evidence of a difference in disease recurrence between fertility-sparing surgery and conventional surgery. Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study.</P>
<P>Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life (QoL). All studies were at very high risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>One study showed a lower recurrence rate with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, although this study was at high risk of bias and the results should be interpreted with caution. After evaluating the five small retrospective studies, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of different types and approaches of surgery, including conservative surgery, as well as adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for management of GCTs of the ovary. The available evidence is very limited, and the review provides only low-quality evidence. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may alter our findings.</P>
<P>Ideally, multinational RCTs are needed to answer these questions. The disease is relatively rare and generally has a good prognosis. RCTs are challenging to conduct, but three ongoing trials have been identified, demonstrating that they are feasible, although two of these studies are single-arm trials. The study that may be able to provide answers to the question of which chemotherapeutic regimen should be selected for management of sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing, randomised, phase 2 study, led by the Gynaecological Oncology Group to compare the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel versus standard BEP. These investigators are also looking into the value of inhibin A and inhibin B as predictive biomarkers. Additional trials are required to assess toxicity and QoL associated with different treatment regimens as well as the safety of conservative surgical options.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:34:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary (unless otherwise stated, GCTs throughout this review refers to the adult-onset type) are classified under the category of sex -cord stromal tumours, which have an age-standardised rate ranging between countries from 0 to 0.9 cases per 100,000 women (aged 20 to 74 years) per year (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2003</LINK>). GCTs account for 70% to 85% of malignant sex cord stromal tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>) but overall constitute only 2% to 5% of all ovarian tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Aboud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboud 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malmstrom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>). Adult-onset GCTs most frequently occur during the perimenopausal or early postmenopausal period (<LINK REF="REF-Aboud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboud 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Rustum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Rustum 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>) and are more likely to be unilateral than bilateral.</P>
<P>The clinical presentation of GCTs may involve detection of a pelvic mass, but most women present with postmenopausal bleeding or irregular perimenopausal bleeding. GCTs secrete hormones, hence women present with symptoms caused by the production of oestrogen (primary female sex hormones), follicle-regulating protein, folliculin and the inhibin hormone. These act primarily to inhibit the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone by the anterior pituitary gland, which releases many hormones that affect growth, sexual development, metabolism and the system of reproduction (<LINK REF="REF-Gershenson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gershenson 2004</LINK>). Thus, it is usually the general gynaecologist or endocrinologist who initiates investigations for GCTs.</P>
<P>Patients with GCTs of the ovary are often treated with surgery alone. Although patients often present at an early stage, adult-onset GCTs are malignant and can metastasise, recur and cause death. Around a quarter of patients develop recurrent tumours and require further treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>). One-third of recurrences present more than five years after initial treatment, and one-fifth after 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Aboud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboud 1997</LINK>). Reported five-year overall survival for patients with stage I disease ranges from 75% to 95%, with many studies demonstrating survival rates in excess of 90% (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>). However, the five-year overall survival rate is reduced to between 55% and 75% for patients with stage II tumour and drops to 22% to 50% for those with stage III/IV tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Colombo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombo 2007</LINK>). The overall 10-year survival rate has been reported as between 85% and 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Ayhan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayhan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savage-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 1998</LINK>), and reported disease mortality rates are approximately 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1975</LINK>; Homesley 1999). More than 70% of women with recurrent disease die from their disease (<LINK REF="REF-Colombo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malmstrom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmstrom 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pathologically, the grade of malignancy of GCTs is difficult to determine (<LINK REF="REF-Aboud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboud 1997</LINK>). Unfortunately, no histological signs are accurate for predicting poor prognosis. The only absolute indicative factor for prognosis is the presence of extraovarian spread at the time of initial diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1992</LINK>). Tumour size and mitotic rate are associated with poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1975</LINK>).</P>

<P>A vast majority of cases are International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2000</LINK>) stage I disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pankratz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Pankratz 1978</LINK>). However, as staging may be incomplete at the time of primary surgery, this has been disputed (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Rustum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Rustum 2006</LINK>) because nodal metastases are rarely reported at primary diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Rustum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Rustum 2006</LINK>). As a result, many patients do not receive further treatment after initial surgery, and recurrence can occur decades after primary diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 2003</LINK>), possibly because the natural history of the tumour is relatively indolent and residual disease may take many years to become clinically apparent. Even if a GCT is confined to the ovary, hyperoestrogenism over a prolonged time may lead to endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. The reported co-incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in GCTs of the ovary is 24% to 80%, and that of adenocarcinoma is 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Hoskins-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoskins 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgery has been the mainstay of treatment for GCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>). Advanced tumour stage and the presence of residual disease are associated with poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Rustum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Rustum 2006</LINK>). Complete surgical resection with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is often performed (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>), and some sources suggest that primary treatment has the biggest influence on relapse and survival rates (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haba-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haba 1993</LINK>). This reinforces the argument for initial comprehensive surgical exploration and staging (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Rustum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Rustum 2006</LINK>). Staging of sex cord stromal tumours is generally similar to that of epithelial ovarian tumours, as defined by FIGO. This involves a vertical midline laparotomy incision that allows adequate exploration and biopsy of the upper abdomen and its contents (omentum, underside of diaphragm, paracolic gutters and bowel serosa). It may include a partial omentectomy, evaluation of para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes, peritoneal biopsies and peritoneal washings for cytology (<LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>). However, the prognostic significance of positive cytology or surface involvement in GCTs has not been well defined, unlike in epithelial tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>). Few recent studies have addressed the value of lymphadenectomy in GCTs, and the rate of lymph node metastasis in sex cord stromal tumours is extremely low so can be safely omitted (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thrall-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thrall 2011</LINK>). Controversy has arisen regarding the management of younger women who desire to retain fertility and have disease apparently confined to one ovary (stage Ia) (<LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>)&#8212;this describes more than 90% of such cases (<LINK REF="REF-Colombo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombo 2007</LINK>). If fertility-sparing surgery is performed, an endometrial biopsy is recommended to rule out concomitant endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Schumer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumer 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(B) Non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>(i) A variety of opinions have been expressed on chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for newly diagnosed disease and/or as primary treatment for recurrent disease (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tumour markers</HEADING>
<P>Inhibin and anti-müllerian hormones are produced by granulosa cells and have been used as tumour markers for initial diagnosis, for assessment of response to treatment and for follow-up. Their effectiveness as tumour markers for guidance on adjuvant therapy, follow-up and recurrence is unclear, as evidence comes from studies at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Boggess-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boggess 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geerts-I-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts I 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mom-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mom 2007</LINK>). Targeted therapies are an emerging treatment modality for ovarian cancer, and identification of the <I>FOXL-2</I> mutation (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Angelo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Angelo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamieson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamieson 2010</LINK>) in the pathogenesis of GCT of the ovary is now under evaluation. Consequently, recruitment of participants is now under way for a trial investigating the effects of ketoconazole on adult GCT of the ovary (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01584297" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01584297</LINK>).</P>
<P>Long-term follow-up has recently emerged as an independent predictor of relapse, prompting recommendations for lifelong follow-up, even in early-stage GCT of the ovary (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:42:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Optimum management for granulosa cell tumour (GCT) of the ovary varies, and relatively little evidence has been reported by small trials and cohort studies. To our knowledge, no systematic reviews have examined the management of adult GCT of the ovary. Treatment is usually individualised because of the rarity of the disease. Although staging of GCT of the ovary follows that of epithelial ovarian cancer, its pathology, recurrence rate and management differ and remain challenging for the oncologist.</P>
<P>Furthermore, no standard follow-up has been determined for the management of adult GCTs of the ovary. This systematic review was conducted to establish and summarise existing evidence and to highlight gaps in the literature.</P>

<P>Studies that included women with co-existing tumours were excluded from the review, unless investigators reported separately the effects of treatment for women without co-existing tumours.

<P>The three categories above were analysed separately. If tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging was used, this was converted to FIGO staging. The staging methods used, as well as reasons for incomplete staging, were specified, either from the study report or by contacting the study authors. However, in cases where this information was difficult or not possible to obtain, this fact was clearly stated and data analysed appropriately when more than one study was included in this comparison group. In such circumstances, the study was excluded if inclusion was deemed inappropriate by consensus of the review authors.</P>

<P>The five included retrospective cohort studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>) provided data on 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT; diagnosis appeared to be pathologically confirmed in 522 of these women, and analyses focused on 362 women. It is unclear from the <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK> abstract whether analyses included data on the 160 women who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, as the abstract reports only the results of the 41 women who received different forms of adjuvant chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Two studies were single-centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>), and three were multicentre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The single-centre <LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK> study looked into the management of 103 women with GCT of the ovary from 1961 to 2006. All 103 women had been treated surgically. In this study women who received adjuvant radiotherapy (31/103) were compared with those who did not. The single-centre <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> study assessed 45 women between 1979 and 1998 who underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (4/45) and compared them with those who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (41/45). This study also compared women who underwent chemotherapy (30/45) as adjuvant treatment and those who received no adjuvant chemotherapy because they had no macroscopic residual disease. In addition, women who received external beam radiotherapy (11/45) as adjuvant treatment were compared with those who did not.</P>
<P>The multicentre studies of <LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK> examined 97, 176 and 201 (41 of which received adjuvant chemotherapy) women with GCT of the ovary from 1965 to 2008, from 1984 to 2010 and from 1995 to 2010, respectively.</P>
<P>The Italian multicentre MITO-9 retrospective study (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>) included women treated at or referred after primary treatment to MITO centres; all 97 women had undergone some form of surgery, and effects of surgical approach, lymphadenectomy and adjuvant treatment were compared in the form of Cox models. Participants were excluded if they had a concomitant diagnosis of another malignancy that was not a GCT or an endometrial carcinoma.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK> compared women who underwent fertility-sparing surgery (98/176) versus conventional staging surgery (78/176). Women who received chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment (28/176) were compared with those who did not.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>None of the five studies reported on parity, histological grade or performance status or provided details of whether women had received previous therapy. Median tumour size was not reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Median age in the <LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK> study was 47 years, and median tumour size was 10 cm (range 1 to 28 cm). Around three-quarters of the women had stage I disease. Median follow-up was 73 months, and by the end of the study, 38% of participants had developed recurrent disease and 12 women had died (10 of these women died of GCT).</P>
<P>Mean and median age in the <LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK> study was 52 and 51 years, respectively (range 27 to 82). Seventy (72%) women had stage I GCT of the ovary, and a further 11/97 (11%) had 'apparent' stage I (Ix) disease. Median follow-up was 88 months (range six to 498). At the time of last follow-up, five participants (4.5%) had died of disease, six (5.5%) were alive with evidence of disease, 80 (75%) were alive with no evidence of disease and 14 (13%) were lost to follow-up; two deaths (1.9%) were considered related to other causes.</P>
<P>Women in the <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK> study had a median age of 46 years and a mean tumour size of 10.4 cm (range 0.2 to 40). Most of the women in this study (77%) had stage I disease. Median follow-up was 60.7 months, and a recurrence rate similar to that of <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> was reported (21%). In the <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK> study, 137/176 (78%) women had stage I disease; nine of 176 (5%) had stage II, 10/176 (6%) had stage III and one of 176 (0.5%) had stage IV disease. In 19/176 (11%) women, disease stage was not known.</P>
<P>Median age in <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK> was 47 years (range 37 to 58). Most women had stage I disease (86%). No differences in body mass index (BMI), age or race were noted between groups. Median follow-up time was 41 months (range 0.2 to 350). A total of 17 of 41 participants (41%) with disease recurrence had received a chemotherapy regimen.</P>
<P>Median age in <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> was 46 years, and 52% of women had stage I to II disease. Median follow-up was 84 months, and the recurrence rate was 21%. Mean survival with early and late-stage disease was 122 and 34 months, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Review authors used multivariate analyses to attempt to determine which factors were associated with better outcomes in terms of overall and disease-free survival or both.</P>
<P>The authors in the <LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK> study reported DFS in univariate and multivariate analyses but reported OS rates only at 5, 10 and 15 years of follow-up. The HR in the multivariate model for disease recurrence was adjusted for postoperative radiotherapy, tumour size, stage, unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, presence of endometrial cancer and rupture. Median DFS was also reported. Adverse events and other important secondary outcomes were not reported in any of the studies, other than toxicity, which was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed in the <LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK> study to identify independent predictors of recurrence and survival. To define prognostic parameters for relapse and survival, variables regarding participant characteristics were dichotomised in the following manner: age younger than 50 or older than 50 years of age; juvenile GCT subtype versus adult GCT histology; tumour size smaller than 10 cm versus larger than 10 cm; primary surgery at MITO centres or elsewhere; conservative versus radical surgery; laparoscopic versus laparotomic approach; complete staging versus incomplete staging; residual disease at primary surgery versus no residual disease; execution of lymphadenectomy versus no lymph node dissection; stage I of disease versus advanced stage of disease and adjuvant treatment versus no postsurgical treatment. Variables with P value less than 0.05 on univariate analysis were selected for multivariate analysis.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK> study analysed PFS in women with GCTs who received different chemotherapy regimens. Hazard ratios for recurrence were estimated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. In univariate analysis, BMI of 30 or greater was associated with worse PFS (HR 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.92). The exact variables used in the Cox models for PFS were not explicitly reported, but it is likely that variables on demographics including age, race and BMI and clinical data including stage and adjuvant treatment were assessed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> reported OS in both a univariate model and a multivariate model that was adjusted for age, menopausal status, parity, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Overall response rate in the chemotherapy arm was reported, along with mild toxicity and treatment-related deaths (none). The numbers of deaths have been documented by cause.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK> study reported overall 5- and 10-year survival rates. Recurrence rates were also reported in univariate and multivariate analyses. The multivariate Cox model for disease recurrence was adjusted for age, initial stage, presence of residual tumour after initial surgery, need for adjuvant chemotherapy, tumour size and type of surgery.</P>

<P>All were retrospective analyses, so the methods of sequence generation and concealment of allocation (relevant only to RCTs) were deemed to be unsatisfactory. None of the five studies reported details of assignment of participants to groups. Thus it was unclear whether the two intervention groups in each study were representative of women with GCT of the ovary. None of the studies reported whether outcome assessors were blinded. It was unclear whether additional bias may have been present in any of the studies, but it did seem that outcomes may have been selectively reported, as none of the studies had adequate and complete reporting of overall survival data using appropriate methods, or studies did not report the HR, although DFS was by and large well reported. A multivariate analysis was performed in all five studies, with adjustment for important prognostic factors, so the two groups in each study were deemed to be comparable. At least 90% of participants were assessed at the endpoint in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK>), but this item was scored as having high risk of bias in the <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> study, as less than 80% of participants were assessed at endpoint, and as having unclear (so potentially high) risk of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>, as information was insufficient to permit judgement based on the abstract.</P>

Only older age at diagnosis (over 50 years), advanced stage of disease and residual tumour at completion of surgery were associated with a poor prognosis in univariate analyses, and multivariate analysis showed age and stage to be independent indicators of poor prognosis for survival. Surgical approach (laparoscopy vs laparotomy) and whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant treatment (mostly chemotherapy) did not appear to impact survival according to univariate analyses and were not considered in the multivariate model.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> reported a median follow-up of 84 (six to 141) months.

After multivariate analysis, only residual tumour following surgery and tumour size (13.5 cm) were associated with recurrence.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:20:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Five retrospective cohort studies (including 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) met our inclusion criteria, but all studies were at very high risk of bias.</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>), which carried out multivariate analyses that were undertaken to identify the factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), no evidence suggested a difference in overall survival associated with surgical approaches and whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage survival for all participants combined was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK>) and was not reported at all in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK>) showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who were treated with surgery alone (adjusted HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6, P value 0.04). In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>), no apparent evidence showed differences in disease recurrence associated with execution and type of adjuvant chemotherapy or with type of surgery or surgical approach, other than that surgical staging may be important. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK>), no apparent evidence revealed a difference in disease recurrence between fertility-sparing surgery and surgery performed to remove both tubes and ovaries. Recurrence-free survival was not reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> study.</P>
<P>Specific adverse effects of surgery and toxicity due to chemotherapy or radiotherapy were not adequately documented in any of the five studies, but mild toxicity due to chemotherapy was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK> study, PC was reported to have a more favourable therapeutic index (measure of relative safety of the drug) compared with BEP. Safety and toxicity data of chemotherapeutic regimes are vital in allowing a full assessment of interventions, especially in the <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK> studies, as all of the women who received chemotherapy were given a combination of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin&#8212;PC or BEP.</P>
<P>Quality of life (QoL) data were not documented in any of the five studies. Data on QoL and on complications following surgery would have provided valuable information.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:21:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Although the five included studies met our inclusion criteria, the effectiveness and safety of different types and approaches of surgery (including fertility-sparing surgery; conservative, radical and staging surgery and laparoscopic or laparotomic approach), as well as of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, for the management of adult-onset GCT of the ovary need further evaluation, and no real inferences can be made at this time. Clinical practice is unlikely to change on the basis of these five studies. Although one study assessed the effects of postoperative radiotherapy and showed lower risk of recurrence in women who received radiotherapy, this study was at very high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We were unable to fully address our objectives in this review; types of interventions and outcomes (primary and secondary) specified in the review were incompletely reported. No studies primarily compared fertility-sparing surgery versus non-conservative staging surgery or toxicity data versus different chemotherapeutic regimens. None of the studies provided any documentation with regard to the nature of follow-up or any guidance on tumour markers.</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence is of low quality (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group 2004</LINK>), as we are very uncertain about each of the survival estimates for all of the comparisons examined, and these biases and uncertainties in the review may seriously weaken confidence in the results. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may further inform our findings. The effectiveness and safety of different treatment modalities for the management of adult-onset granulosa cell tumours of the ovary have not been assessed in RCTs or even in good quality non-randomised studies. Although all five included studies used statistical adjustment, which may minimise the effects of selection bias, the fact that all studies were at very high risk of bias based on a thorough assessment of quality items makes conclusions based on this potentially unreliable evidence uncertain. If the GRADE approach is used (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group 2004</LINK>), any sort of recommendations for the use of any treatment modality in this setting on the basis of available observational studies would be very unlikely because the benefits and potential harms of these treatments are unclear and point estimates were not reported in many cases, so consistency of point estimates and accuracy of these estimates (examination of 95% CIs) could not be assessed (only P values of statistically significant results were reported from Cox models for survival in <LINK REF="STD-Mangili-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mangili 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2012</LINK> studies in most cases). It is unclear what effect the design of these studies and the selection of co-variates used in statistical adjustment had on the validity of the findings. However, these adjustments did appear to be sensible, so overall we deemed the evidence to be of low quality rather than of very low quality, despite the other limitations outlined above. In some patients, radiotherapy could be considered as a possible treatment option independent of the quality assessment; it has been suggested that for some women, radiotherapy following salpingo-oophorectomy may delay time to disease recurrence, but the associated toxicity has not been reported.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:21:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>All five studies were retrospective in nature, at very high risk of bias and likely to be underpowered, given the modest numbers in each study and the multiple adjustments used. HRs should be used for survival outcomes, and an HR was reported explicitly only for DFS in the <LINK REF="STD-Hauspy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hauspy 2011</LINK> study and for the comparison of PC and BEP in <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2013</LINK>. Currently, the quality of the evidence is low; therefore further evidence from good quality prospective studies is needed.</P>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment modalities for the management of primary and recurrent granulosa cell tumours of the ovary. We were unable to address these specific objectives adequately, as the quality of the evidence was low (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group 2004</LINK>), all five included studies were at very high risk of bias and survival outcomes were poorly and incompletely reported (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>). Other important outcomes such as QoL, adverse events, toxicity and details of tumour markers were not reported at all or were reported to an inadequate level. We were unable to deduce valid conclusions on types of surgery and on adjuvant treatment options.</P>
<P>The five studies met all of our inclusion criteria, but the results should be interpreted with caution; the findings of this review are unlikely to change clinical practice, although further research is very likely to have an important impact, so this outcome could change if future trials are included in a subsequent update. Each of the included studies has multiple limitations, with poor and incomplete reporting of outcomes a matter of particular concern. RCTs are challenging in this area, but we did identify one relevant comparative ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01042522" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01042522</LINK>) that compared the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel with that of BEP, so they are feasible (see <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>). Ideally, multicentre RCTs with long-term follow-up comparing other treatment modalities are needed to define the role of treatment for ovarian GCTs.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:22:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature, and all studies were sifted and data extracted independently by at least two review authors. We suspected that we would find no relevant RCTs. Therefore, we attempted to ensure that we did not overlook any relevant evidence by searching a wide range of non-randomised studies of reasonable quality design.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be publication bias: Studies that did not find benefits of different treatment modalities may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility, as we did not find an adequate number of studies that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:22:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Several relevant prospective phase 2 trials had good methodological quality, but unfortunately, these were one-arm trials and did not include a comparison group. A prospective clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pecorelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pecorelli 1999</LINK>) led by the European Organization of Research and Cancer Gynecological Cooperative Group/Gynecological Cancer Cooperative Group (EORTC/GCCG) group assessed cisplatin (P), vinblastine (V) and bleomycin (B) as a combination regimen in recurrent or advanced GCT of the ovary and confirmed therapeutic activity of the PVB regimen. This was a good quality trial, which focused on chemotherapeutic toxicity and response rate outcomes. A phase 3 trial to confirm these potentially promising findings would be welcomed. The phase 2 trial led by the Gynaecological Oncology Group (GOG) (<LINK REF="STD-Homesley--1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homesley 1999</LINK>) examined the efficacy and toxicity of bleomycin (B), etoposide (E) and cisplatin (P) for ovarian stromal malignancies. Most of the women had GCT of the ovary, and this trial showed BEP to be an active regimen as a first-line chemotherapeutic combination for ovarian sex cord stromal tumours. The results of this trial are still applied in clinical practice, with the BEP regimen commonly used as the primary adjuvant treatment for management of GCT of the ovary. The previously used vinblastine was replaced by etoposide because of toxicity, but a phase 3 RCT is sought to confirm these findings.</P>
<P>One ongoing study following the emerging theory of <I>FOXL-2</I> mutations in GCT of the ovary is examining the effect of ketoconazole, which acts<B> </B>as an inhibitor of the enzyme CYP17. However, this is a single-arm phase 2 trial that will not be able to offer comparable data (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01584297" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01584297</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another phase 2 study led by the Gynaecological Oncology Group is a single-arm study assessing the effect of paclitaxel in women with ovarian stromal cancers. This study includes not only women with GCTs but also women with all ovarian stromal cancers that have not been amenable to surgery or women who have had recurrent disease after a single chemotherapeutic treatment. This study may help in guiding clinicians regarding treatment for recurrent cases (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00006227" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00006227</LINK>), but again, unless a phase 3 trial takes precedence, a gap in the evidence will remain.</P>
<P>The study that may provide answers to the question of the best choice of chemotherapeutic regimen in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised phase 2 study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01042522" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01042522</LINK>) that is comparing the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel with that of the standard BEP; it is being led by the GOG. Women who have undergone surgery with stages II to IVA recurrent disease and women with residual disease measuring greater than 1 cm following primary surgery are eligible. Moreover, this study is also looking into the value of inhibin A and inhibin B as predictive biomarkers.</P>
<P>Given the paucity of assessable data and the lack of RCTs, we recognise that available data are of limited value, and it is unlikely that clinical practice will change. However, we have highlighted gaps in the literature and have summarised existing evidence for the treatment and management of GCTs. We believe that in the absence of robust evidence, this review is important for facilitating decision making and outlining treatment options open to women. We recognise that GCTs are rare tumours; hence we have highlighted the need to conduct good quality studies and/or trials and have acknowledged the difficulties involved in doing so. These are rare cancers, and the published data reflect decades of &#8220;research,&#8221; mainly with small, phase 2, non-randomised studies or case series from centres worldwide.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:22:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>After evaluating only five small retrospective studies, we are unable to reach valid conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of different types and approaches of surgery such as fertility-sparing surgery, as well as adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for the management of GCTs of the ovary in clinical practice. One study showed improved disease-free survival with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, but because of high risk of bias, it is difficult to make meaningful clinical decisions based on these data. In the other studies that reported both overall and disease-free survival, no apparent survival advantage was seen with adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or no further treatment after surgery. No clear recommendations about the type of surgery that should be offered can be made on the basis of the available data.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The available evidence is very limited, and the quality of this evidence in this review is low. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may alter our findings. Ideally, multinational RCTs are needed to answer these questions. Although the disease is relatively rare and generally has a good prognosis, RCTs are challenging, but the fact that we identified three ongoing trials shows that they are feasible, albeit two of the trials are single-arm trials. The study that may provide answers to the question of the best choice of chemotherapeutic regimen in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised phase 2 study that is comparing the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel with that of the standard BEP; it is being led by the GOG. Moreover, this study is also looking into the value of inhibin A and inhibin B as predictive biomarkers. Additional trials are required to assess toxicity and QoL with the use of different treatment regimens and to assess the safety of conservative surgical options.</P>

<P>We added the following study constraint in the types of studies section, as it was apparent that selection bias would lead to considerably distorted results.</P>
<P>To minimise the effects of selection bias (systematic differences between baseline characteristics of the groups compared), we included only studies that applied statistical adjustments for baseline case mix using multivariate analyses (e.g. adjusting for age, stage, performance status, grade).</P>
<P>We had initially specified in the protocol that we would assess the risk of bias in non-randomised controlled trials in accordance with the <LINK REF="REF-Newcastle_x002d_Ottawa-Scale" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcastle-Ottawa Scale</LINK>. However, after publication of the protocol, we identified a subsequent publication that was based in part on this scheme (<LINK REF="REF-Taggart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taggart 2001</LINK>), and we created a modified version that we thought more adequately addressed risk of bias in the five included studies. A degree of repetition was noted in the <LINK REF="REF-Newcastle_x002d_Ottawa-Scale" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcastle-Ottawa Scale</LINK>, with core risk of bias items including assessment of attrition bias and items included that we thought were of lesser importance.</P>
<P>Only five studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, and none of these findings could be pooled, so we were unable to perform any quantitative synthesis. Should more studies be identified for updates of the review, the following methods will be employed.</P>
<P>Data on outcomes will be extracted in this way.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time-to-event (overall and recurrence-free survival) data, we will extract the log of the hazard ratio [log(HR)] and its standard error from trial reports; if these are not reported, we will attempt to estimate them from other reported statistics using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. </LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. adverse events, deaths), we will extract the number of participants in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at endpoint to estimate a risk ratio (RR).</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes (e.g. quality of life measures), we will extract the final value and standard deviation of the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at endpoint in each treatment arm at the end of follow-up to estimate the mean difference between treatment arms and its standard error.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When possible, all data extracted will be those relevant to an intention-to-treat analysis, in which participants are analysed in the groups to which they were assigned.</P>
<P>The time points at which outcomes were collected and reported will be noted.</P>
<P>Data will be abstracted independently by two review authors (MG, AB) onto a data abstraction form specially designed for the review. Differences between review authors will be resolved by discussion or by appeal to a third review author if necessary.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<P>We will use the following measures of the effects of treatment.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time-to-event data, we will use the HR, if possible. The HR summarises the chances of survival in women who received one type of treatment compared with the chances of survival in women who received another type of treatment. However, the logarithm of the HR, rather than the HR itself, is generally used in meta-analyses.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcomes, we will use the RR.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes, we will use mean differences between treatment arms if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale; otherwise standardised mean differences will be used.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>If data are missing or only imputed data are reported, we will contact study authors to request data on outcomes only among participants who were assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by visual inspection of forest plots, by estimation of the percentage of heterogeneity between trials that cannot be ascribed to sampling variation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), by a formal statistical test of the significance of the heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>) and, if possible, by subgroup analyses (see below). If evidence of substantial heterogeneity is found, possible reasons for this will be investigated and reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>Funnel plots corresponding to meta-analysis of the primary outcome will be examined to assess the potential for small-study effects. When evidence of small-study effects is found, publication bias will be considered as only one of a number of possible explanations.<I> </I>If these plots suggest that treatment effects may not be sampled from a symmetrical distribution, as assumed by the random-effects model, sensitivity analyses will be performed using fixed-effect models.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>When sufficient clinically similar studies are available, their adjusted results will be pooled in meta-analyses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time-to-event data, HRs will be pooled using the generic inverse variance facility of RevMan 5.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcomes, the RR was calculated for each study, and all RRs were then pooled.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes, mean differences (or standardised mean differences) between treatment arms at the end of follow-up will be pooled.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If any studies have multiple treatment groups, the &#8216;shared&#8217; comparison group will be divided into the number of treatment groups and comparisons between each treatment group, and the split comparison group will be treated as independent comparisons.</P>
<P>Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting will be used for all meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses will be performed with trials grouped by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>stage of disease; and</LI>
<LI>primary or recurrent disease.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Factors such as age, stage, type of intervention and length of follow-up will be considered in interpretation of any heterogeneity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will be performed while excluding studies at high risk of bias.</P>

<P>Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of recurrence and survival. To define prognostic parameters for relapse and survival, variables regarding women's characteristics were dichotomised in the following manner: age &lt; 50 or &gt; 50 years; juvenile GCT subtype versus adult GCT histology; tumour size measuring &lt; 10 or &gt; 10 cm; primary surgery at MITO centres or elsewhere; conservative versus radical surgery; laparoscopic versus laparotomic approach; complete staging versus incomplete staging; residual disease at primary surgery versus no residual disease; execution of lymphadenectomy versus no lymph node dissection; stage I of disease versus advanced stage of disease and adjuvant treatment versus no postsurgical treatment. Variables with P value &lt; 0.05 on univariate analysis were selected for multivariate analysis<BR/>
</P>
<P>Older age at diagnosis (&gt; 50 years), advanced stage of disease and residual tumour at the end of surgery were associated with a poor prognosis. At multivariate analysis, age (HR 5.52, 95% CI 2.42 to 6.86) and stage (HR 10.25, 95% CI 8.21 to 16.64) were independent poor prognostic indicators for survival. Histology, number of mitoses, mass diameter, surgical approach (laparoscopy vs laparotomy), surgical staging, lymphadenectomy, treatment at a referral tertiary centre and postoperative treatment were not statistically significantly associated with death</P>
<P>Surgical treatment outside the MITO centre (HR 3.32, 95% CI 1.35 to 8.15) and incomplete surgical staging (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.28) retained significant predictive value for recurrence in both univariate and multivariate analyses.
