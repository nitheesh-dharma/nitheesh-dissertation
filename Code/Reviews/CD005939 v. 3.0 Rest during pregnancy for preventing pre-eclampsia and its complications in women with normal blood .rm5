<P>Not enough evidence to say if rest is helpful in preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications for women with normal blood pressure during pregnancy.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. Rest has been proposed as being beneficial for women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia, including those with normal blood pressure. There are also possible adverse effects such as the potential for increasing the risk of blood clots in the legs, and the impact considerable periods of rest on women's lives and that of their families. The review of trials found two small studies, of not very good quality, and there were insufficient data to say what the potential benefits and harms might be. Further studies are needed, and in the meantime women will be guided by their own beliefs and reasoning, as well as those of their caregivers.</P>

</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised trials evaluating the effects of rest or advise to reduce physical activity for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Data were double checked for accuracy.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two small trials (106 women) of uncertain quality were included. Both recruited women with a singleton pregnancy at moderate risk of pre-eclampsia from 28 to 32 weeks' gestation. There was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk of pre-eclampsia with four to six hours rest per day (one trial, 32 women; relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.83), but not of gestational hypertension (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.00), compared to normal activity. Rest of 30 minutes per day plus nutritional supplementation was associated with a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia (one trial, 74 women; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.51) and also of gestational hypertension (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.63). The effect on caesarean section was unclear (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.41). No other outcomes were reported. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Daily rest, with or without nutrient supplementation, may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia for women with normal blood pressure, although the reported effect may reflect bias and/or random error rather than a true effect. There is no information about outcomes such as perinatal mortality and morbidity, maternal morbidity, women's views, adverse effects, and costs. Current evidence is insufficient to support recommending rest or reduced activity to women for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. Whether women rest during pregnancy should therefore be a matter of personal choice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:44:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy. Around 10% of women will have raised blood pressure at some point before delivery. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy comprise a spectrum of conditions that is usually classified into four categories: (i) gestational hypertension, a rise in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy; (ii) pre-eclampsia, usually hypertension with proteinuria (protein in urine) during the second half of pregnancy; (iii) chronic hypertension, a rise in blood pressure prior to pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation, and (iv) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). For women with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Outcome deteriorates if the blood pressure is very high, or pre-eclampsia develops. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder involving the liver, kidneys, brain, and placenta. It affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>), and is associated with a substantive increase in morbidity and mortality for both the woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>). Complications for the mother may include eclampsia (seizures), stroke, liver or kidney failure, and abnormal blood clotting, and problems for the baby include poor growth and preterm birth. </P>
<P>The cause of pre-eclampsia is uncertain, but current belief is that reduced blood supply to the placenta leads to abnormal function of endothelial cells lining blood vessels, possibly as a result of oxidative stress. Endothelial cell dysfunction results in generalised vasoconstriction, platelet activation and thrombosis, and decreased plasma volume, reducing blood supply to multiple organs. Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Restriction of activity and rest have traditionally been advocated during pregnancy for a variety of indications, including prevention and treatment of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1994</LINK>). Surveys conducted in Canada and USA on obstetrician and physician management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy suggest that advice to stop work or to rest more, or both, is common when blood pressure is raised (<LINK REF="REF-Caetano-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caetano 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maloni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maloni 1998</LINK>). This advice is based largely on findings from case-control studies, and the observation that when women are walking or moving about, they have a higher systolic blood pressure than when they have been sitting for some time. The issue of rest for women with hypertension during pregnancy is covered by another review (<LINK REF="REF-Meher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Women with normal blood pressure may also be advised to rest during pregnancy to reduce their risk of developing gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. In the past, another rationale for advising women that rest might reduce their risk of pre-eclampsia came from the belief that exercise would reduce uteroplacental blood flow, and bed rest would increase it. As pre-eclampsia is known to be associated with reduced placental perfusion, it was hypothesised that bed rest might therefore help prevent this syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Mathews-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathews 1978</LINK>). There is no information on how often women with normal blood pressure are advised to rest when they are at home. Nevertheless, it seems likely that women at high risk of pre-eclampsia would be offered this advice more often than those at low risk. Such advice may not come only from caregivers, but also from the lay literature, from friends and from family. Women with multiple pregnancy are at increased risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. In the past, women with multiple pregnancy and normal blood pressure were frequently advised to rest in hospital to improve pregnancy outcome, especially to reduce the risk of early birth and poor fetal growth. The effects of rest, including on hypertension, for women with a multiple pregnancy are covered by a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The relationship between rest, physical activity, and risk of pre-eclampsia is unclear and there is controversy over the potential effects of these interventions. In a cohort study of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, women with normal blood pressure in their first pregnancy who were in paid employment had higher blood pressures and risk of developing pre-eclampsia than those who were not in paid employment (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). A meta-analysis of observational studies of occupational physical activity has also shown an association between physically demanding work and increased risk of hypertension and pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2000</LINK>). In contrast, observational studies of regular recreational physical activity during pregnancy report a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Marcoux-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcoux 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorensen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorensen 2003</LINK>), and it has been suggested that exercise may even help prevent pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Weissgerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissgerber 2004</LINK>). However, at present there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials evaluating aerobic exercise in healthy pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2002</LINK>), and in women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Meher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There may also be risks associated with rest. Prolonged reduction in physical activity increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This is particularly so during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacevich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacevich 2000</LINK>), when the risk is already considerably higher. In addition, restriction of activity may be stressful and disruptive to women's lives. It may lead to difficulty with caring for their family and may mean that they (or their partner) have to give up recreational activities or paid employment. Discontinuation of paid employment may have financial implications for both the woman and her family, as well as the employer. </P>
<P>Any advice for women to alter their lifestyle to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia needs to be supported by reliable evidence that the benefits of following such advice outweigh the harms or inconveniences associated with it. It is therefore important to evaluate the effects of rest for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. </P>

<P>(a) High risk:<I> </I>defined as having one or more of the following: diabetes, renal disease, thrombophilia, autoimmune disease, or previous severe or early onset pre-eclampsia (for multiple pregnancy, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2001</LINK>).<BR/>(b) Moderate risk: defined as none of the above, but having either previous pre-eclampsia that was not severe or early onset (or severity unspecified), or a first pregnancy and at least one of the following: teenager or over 35 years age, family history of pre-eclampsia, obesity (body mass index of at least 30), increased sensitivity to Angiotensin II, positive roll-over test, abnormal uterine artery doppler scan.<BR/>(c) Low risk: defined as pregnancy that does not qualify as either high or moderate risk.<BR/>(d) Undefined risk: when the risk is unclear or not specified.</P>
<P>Women were excluded if they had hypertension or established pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>If a trial included women with pre-eclampsia or non-proteinuric hypertension as well as women with normal blood pressure, where possible, we planned to include only women with normal blood pressure. For trials that did not report results separately for the two groups, we planned to include them in the review but present them as a separate subgroup. No such studies were identified, however. </P>

<P>We carried out statistical analyses using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We presented the results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. As there was only one trial in each comparison, there was no need to assess heterogeneity. When more data become available, the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic will be used to assess heterogeneity between trials. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results will be pooled using a fixed-effect model. If substantial heterogeneity is detected (I<SUP>2</SUP> more than 50%), we will explore possible causes and will perform subgroup analyses for the main outcomes. Heterogeneity that is not explained by subgroup analyses may be modelled using a random-effects analysis, where appropriate.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Two studies were included in this review (total 106 women). One study was conducted in Colombia (<LINK REF="STD-Herrera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 1993</LINK>), and the other in USA (<LINK REF="STD-Spinapolice-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spinapolice 1983</LINK>). <I>See </I>'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>Both studies included nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy, normal blood pressure and a positive roll-over test. According to the criteria used in our protocol, all participants were therefore at moderate risk of pre-eclampsia. The women were enrolled between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation. Their baseline level of activity at trial entry is not reported for either trial. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Spinapolice-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spinapolice 1983</LINK>), some participants were in paid employment, but the level of physical activity in this employment is not stated. For the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Herrera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 1993</LINK>), there is no information about baseline activity at trial entry, although it is reported that women in the control group did not have regular daytime rest. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>One trial compared four hours per day of rest with unrestricted activity. The other compared two 15-minute periods of rest each day plus a nutrient supplement (soy protein, calcium and linoleic acid) three times per week with unrestricted activity plus placebo. For both trials, rest was lying in the left lateral position at home, but not necessarily in bed. Neither required women to stop working.</P>
<P>Neither trial reported data on compliance with the advice to rest. Although one study (<LINK REF="STD-Spinapolice-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spinapolice 1983</LINK>) states that the participants were visited by nursing staff three times a week to ensure compliance with rest, no information is available about what the nurses observed during these visits. Also, there is little information about women's baseline activity level or the activity level during the trial in the control group.</P>
<P>Trials of rest for women with a multiple pregnancy are described in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>Ten studies were excluded. Nine studies were excluded because all women had hypertension at trial entry (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catalano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somers-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1989</LINK>). In addition, in four of these studies all comparison groups had bed rest. Three of these studies compared an antihypertensive drug plus bed rest with bed rest alone (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catalano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1992</LINK>). The fourth was a three-arm study in which bed rest alone was compared with bed rest and compliance enhancement training with and without biobehavioural intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Somers-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1989</LINK>). One study was excluded because more than fifty per cent of the women randomised had miscarriages prior to 20 weeks' gestation; therefore, it was impossible to assess over half the participants for development of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1993</LINK>). <I>See</I> 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality of both trials is unclear. The methods used for allocation concealment were inadequately reported. Completeness of follow up was not reported in either trial. Clearly, blinding of participants to rest was not possible, although the caregivers were blinded in one trial. It is not reported whether the outcome assessor was blinded in either trial. Attempts to contact the trialists for further information were unsuccessful. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:39:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of rest on development of pre-eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure. Data from the two included studies suggest that rest at home from 28 weeks' gestation onwards, with or without nutrient supplementation, may reduce the relative risk of pre-eclampsia for women with a singleton pregnancy at moderate risk. The confidence intervals are wide, however, suggesting that for rest alone the true effect could be anything between a 17% reduction and a 100% reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Spinapolice-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spinapolice 1983</LINK>), and for rest plus nutrients, anywhere between a 49% and 97% reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Herrera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 1993</LINK>). As both trials were small and of uncertain quality, it is likely that at least some of these reported effects are due to the effects of bias and/or random errors, rather than to any true effect of rest. In view of our current understanding of pre-eclampsia as a multifactorial condition which originates in very early pregnancy, a large reduction in relative risk associated with rest from 28 weeks' gestation onwards seems implausible. Moreover, there is no information about other important outcomes such as perinatal mortality and morbidity, maternal morbidity, adverse events, women's views or costs. Therefore, it remains unclear whether rest or advice to rest for normotensive women is overall beneficial. </P>
<P>Neither trial reported data on compliance with the advice to rest, and there is little information about women's baseline activity level or the activity level during the trial in the control group. This information would have been important for understanding and interpreting the results of the studies, and is particularly relevant for trials that assess behavioral interventions. <BR/>
<BR/>Six trials (706 women) have evaluated rest in hospital compared with normal activity at home for women with a multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2001</LINK>). There appeared to be a moderate reduction in the risk of hypertension, although this was borderline for statistical significance (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.01). Data for pre-eclampsia were not reported.</P>
<P>There is little evidence that the nutrient supplements as used in the study by Herrera and colleagues (soy protein, calcium, and linoleic acid) influence the risk of pre-eclampsia. Calcium supplementation for prevention of pre-eclampsia is covered by a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2002</LINK>). Although the results of that review suggest that calcium supplementation reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia, the minimum dose of calcium for included studies is one gramme per day, whereas the dose in this trial was 300 mg three times per week. An interaction between the three supplements and rest remains possible, but would seem unlikely in the absence of evidence that any of the individual agents is beneficial. </P>
<P>Randomised trials evaluating bed rest for a variety of conditions outside pregnancy and during pregnancy have failed to demonstrate any clear evidence of benefit, and attention has been drawn to the potential hazards of recommending bed rest (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1999</LINK>). Caution is even more relevant for rest as a potential preventative intervention. As for any prophylaxis, before recommending rest for preventing pre-eclampsia, we must first be sure that this advice does more good than harm for both mother and baby. Moreover, whether women rest or reduce their physical activity during pregnancy is normally a matter for personal choice. Women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia should not be advised to rest more than they would otherwise choose to unless there is sufficient evidence that this is beneficial, and adequate reassurance that it is not harmful. In the absence of such evidence, women should be allowed to make their own choices.</P>
<P>Further large randomised trials are needed if we are to have reliable evidence about the effects of rest on the risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications. As well as pregnancy outcomes, such trials should collect information on adverse effects, women's views, and costs to the women, society and the health services associated with restriction of activity. Better descriptions of women's patterns of activity and rest will give insight into how findings may be generalised to other women. Such trials would be most appropriate in settings where women with normal blood pressure who have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia are currently advised to rest during pregnancy.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Currently there is insufficient evidence to support recommending rest or restriction of activity to women with normal blood pressure to reduce their risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications. In the absence of such evidence, whether women rest or reduce their physical activity during pregnancy should be a matter of personal choice. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Any further trials should be large, and should collect information about perinatal mortality and morbidity, maternal morbidity, adverse effects associated with rest, women's views on restriction of activity, and costs. Trials should also describe women's baseline level of activity, the duration for which they rested, and whether they were able to rest for the allocated time period.</P>
