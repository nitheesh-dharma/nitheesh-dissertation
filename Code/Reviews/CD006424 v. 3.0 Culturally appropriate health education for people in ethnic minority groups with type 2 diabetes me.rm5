<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does culturally appropriate diabetes health education lead to better outcomes than 'usual care' for people in ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In upper-middle-income and high-income countries, minority ethnic groups often have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus than is seen in the local population. They also tend to come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, with attendant difficulties in accessing good-quality health care. In some cases, cultural and communication barriers increase the problems that minority ethnic communities experience when attempting to access good-quality diabetes health education, which is vital for those who wish to understand diabetes and use available services to gain empowerment and bring about behaviour change toward a healthier lifestyle. In this review, 'culturally appropriate' health education is taken to mean any type of health education that has been specifically tailored to the cultural needs of a target minority group with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This updated review found in the world literature 33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of culturally appropriate health education on diabetes that met the selection criteria (participants from a defined ethnic minority group living in a upper-middle-income or high-income country, over 16 years of age, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and receiving a culturally tailored health education intervention). The median duration of the intervention was six months, and a total of 7453 participants were involved in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Culturally appropriate health education improved blood sugar control among participants, compared with those receiving 'usual' care, at three, six, 12 and 24 months after the intervention was provided. Knowledge about diabetes improved, and participants attained healthier lifestyles. No information was available regarding complications of diabetes and death from any cause, and there was a general lack of reporting of adverse effects in most studies. Neutral effects were observed for health-related quality of life, blood lipids like cholesterol, blood pressure and weight. The costs of educational programmes were rarely analysed. Compared with the first review, performed in 2008 (11 studies), many more published studies were identified in this review (altogether 33 studies), strengthening the original findings that blood sugar control and knowledge of diabetes are improved when culturally appropriate health education is provided to people in ethnic minority groups diagnosed with diabetes. The effects of this improvement are shown in this update as lasting longer &#8212; up to 24 months after health education was provided in some trials. However, additional high-quality standardised RCTs of longer duration are needed, along with full evaluation of costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Heterogeneity of the studies, in terms of populations studied, type and duration of health education provided, variety of outcomes measured and differences in timing of assessment, limits interpretation of our findings. Also, risk of bias was judged to be high for many outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Currentness of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>This evidence is up-to-date as of September 2013.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-06 15:29:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>A systematic literature search was performed of the following databases: <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Google Scholar, as well as reference lists of identified articles. The date of the last search was July 2013 for <I>The Cochrane Library </I>and<I> </I>September 2013 for all other databases. We contacted authors in the field and handsearched commonly encountered journals as well.</P>

<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of culturally appropriate health education for people over 16 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus from named ethnic minority groups residing in upper-middle-income or high-income countries.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-06 15:29:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When disagreements arose regarding selection of papers for inclusion, two additional review authors were consulted for discussion. We contacted study authors to ask for additional information when data appeared to be missing or needed clarification.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-28 12:23:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>A total of 33 trials (including 11 from the original 2008 review) involving 7453 participants were included in this review, with 28 trials providing suitable data for entry into meta-analysis. Although the interventions provided in these studies were very different from one study to another (participant numbers, duration of intervention, group versus individual intervention, setting), most of the studies were based on recognisable theoretical models, and we tried to be inclusive in considering the wide variety of available culturally appropriate health education.</P>
<P>Glycaemic control (as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) showed improvement following culturally appropriate health education at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.5 to -0.2); 14 trials; 1442 participants; high-quality evidence) and at six months (MD -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.4); 14 trials; 1972 participants; high-quality evidence) post intervention compared with control groups who received 'usual care'. This control was sustained to a lesser extent at 12 months (MD -0.2% (95% CI -0.3 to -0.04); 9 trials; 1936 participants) and at 24 months (MD -0.3% (95% CI -0.6 to -0.1); 4 trials; 2268 participants; moderate-quality evidence) post intervention. Neutral effects on health-related quality of life measures were noted and there was a general lack of reporting of adverse events in most studies &#8212; the other two primary outcomes for this review. Knowledge scores showed improvement in the intervention group at three (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.4 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6), six (SMD 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7)) and 12 months (SMD 0.4 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6)) post intervention. A reduction in triglycerides of 24 mg/dL (95% CI -40 to -8) was observed at three months, but this was not sustained at six or 12 months. Neutral effects on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were reported at any follow-up point. Other outcome measures (blood pressure, body mass index, self-efficacy and empowerment) also showed neutral effects compared with control groups. Data on the secondary outcomes of diabetic complications, mortality and health economics were lacking or were insufficient.</P>
<P>Because of the nature of the intervention, participants and personnel delivering the intervention were rarely blinded, so the risk of performance bias was high. Also, subjective measures were assessed by participants who self-reported via questionnaires, leading to high bias in subjective outcome assessment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-06 15:30:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Culturally appropriate health education has short- to medium-term effects on glycaemic control and on knowledge of diabetes and healthy lifestyles. With this update (six years after the first publication of this review), a greater number of RCTs were reported to be of sufficient quality for inclusion in the review. None of these studies were long-term trials, and so clinically important long-term outcomes could not be studied. No studies included an economic analysis. The heterogeneity of the studies made subgroup comparisons difficult to interpret with confidence. Long-term, standardised, multi-centre RCTs are needed to compare different types and intensities of culturally appropriate health education within defined ethnic minority groups, as the medium-term effects could lead to clinically important health outcomes, if sustained.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-11 12:34:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see 'Additional information' provided by the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About,' 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>Although several specific causes of diabetes mellitus have been identified, most cases of diabetes fall into one of two categories, now called type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Type 1 diabetes mellitus has as its main aetiology the destruction of pancreatic islet beta-cells. People with type 1 diabetes mellitus usually need insulin treatment to replace the insulin they can no longer make themselves. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur at an earlier age than type 2 diabetes.</LI>
<LI>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the more common type of diabetes. It includes the common major form of diabetes that results from defect(s) in insulin secretion, almost always combined with insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity and physical inactivity.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 2 diabetes mellitus is more common among people from certain ethnic backgrounds</HEADING>
<P>On a global scale, diabetes is estimated to be the fifth leading cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Roglic-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roglic 2005</LINK>). The global burden of diabetes is increasing. The prevalence of diabetes for all age groups worldwide has been estimated as 6.4% in 2010, rising to 7.7% in 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2010</LINK>), which has increased from Wild's (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2004</LINK>) estimate of an expected rise to 4.4% in 2030. However, this is a simplification of a more complex problem, as illustrated by the UK experience. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes can be as high as 4.3% in UK communities (<LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1989</LINK>), but in certain ethnic minority communities in the same country, it has been found to be as high as 11.2%, or up to four to five times more common than in the indigenous white population (<LINK REF="REF-Fischbacher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischbacher 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mather-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mather 1985</LINK>). In addition, people from some ethnic minority communities appear to develop diabetes at a younger age (<LINK REF="REF-Raleigh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raleigh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1993</LINK>). Similar findings are reported for American Indian and Hispanic communities in the USA, South Asian communities in South Africa and Scandinavia and Maori and Aboriginal communities in New Zealand and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Abate-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abate 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">People from ethnic minority communities living in upper-middle-income or high-income countries (World Bank Classification) tend to be at a disadvantage in accessing health care for a variety of reasons</HEADING>
<P>These communities tend to have the disadvantage that they lack knowledge of the main language of the country, and they are often relatively deprived in comparison with the majority community (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nazroo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nazroo 1997</LINK>). They are less likely to know about available services or to use them for preventive care (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molokhie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molokhie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naish-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naish 1994</LINK>). Even when service provision is equal or higher in an ethnic minority group, outcomes are worse (<LINK REF="REF-Fischbacher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischbacher 2009</LINK>). Not being able to read or understand the main language results in difficulty accessing health information (<LINK REF="REF-Lip-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lip 1996</LINK>). As a result, the focus of specific public health measures for minority communities tends to be decided by health professionals, with little or no reference to the needs of the communities themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhopal-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhopal 1988</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The cost of poorly controlled diabetes is high in some of these communities</HEADING>
<P>Diabetes is a progressive disease with disabling long-term complications if not properly managed. Persistently high blood sugar levels and high blood pressure can result in damage to both large and small blood vessels with ensuing eye, kidney, nerve, heart and circulatory complications; tight control of these parameters and other risk factors such as cholesterol and triglyceride levels can reduce or delay their progression (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>). In particular, the presence of diabetes increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease by three- to four-fold, and morbidity and mortality are significantly higher in people of South Asian origin living in the UK than in their white counterparts (<LINK REF="REF-Mather-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mather 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1996</LINK>). People with diabetes from ethnic minorities in the UK and in North America have been found to be at higher risk for developing complications (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanting-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanting 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Office-of-Minority-Health-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Office of Minority Health 2012</LINK>). Blood sugar control has been shown to be poorer in several studies of South Asian individuals in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Mather-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mather 1998b</LINK>), contributing to an additional increased prevalence of microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy in this group. Along with the cost of diabetic morbidity and mortality for patients and their families, treatment of diabetes in the UK takes up a not insignificant 10% of total health resource expenditures. The vast majority of this is attributed to type 2 diabetes and is due to the treatment of complications of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Hex-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hex 2012</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-11 11:24:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limited evidence suggests that ethnic minority communities benefit from health education programmes</HEADING>
<P>The recommended approach to the management of diabetes is multi-factorial, consisting of optimising blood sugar levels and blood pressure, managing risk factors for heart disease, providing motivational counselling to encourage patients to choose healthier lifestyles and performing regular screening and monitoring for diabetic complications. In addition, providing information about self-management and available services contributes to patient empowerment and facilitates access to services. The Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners in the UK and the British Diabetic Association (1998) have reported that "the twin cornerstones of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus are patient education and lifestyle modification (primarily diet and exercise)" (<LINK REF="REF-Calman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calman 1994</LINK>), and a meta-analysis of studies of educational interventions and outcomes in diabetic adults concluded that these interventions were effective in producing positive patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1990</LINK>). However, research also suggests that many of these programmes are considerably less successful in patients from ethnic minority groups, with worse outcomes, lower rates of participation and higher attrition rates (<LINK REF="REF-Coonrod-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coonrod 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wierenga-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wierenga 1995</LINK>). In addition, ethnic minority groups often are not included as a subgroup in large trials, and little evidence indicates that their outcomes are similarly influenced by health education (<LINK REF="REF-Mukhopadhyay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhopadhyay 2005</LINK>). Surveys of people from ethnic minority groups in the UK have shown that they are likely to know little about diabetes and its management or the services available for screening and management of complications, even when offered the same health care as the indigenous population (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leedham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leedham 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majeed_x002d_Ariss-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majeed-Ariss 2013</LINK>). In the UK, the problem is much worse if patients are unable to speak English well, or to read in English. Study participants tended to place greater emphasis on cultural beliefs about disease and medication, and they found adhering to dietary measures difficult within their ethnic community (<LINK REF="REF-Majeed_x002d_Ariss-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majeed-Ariss 2013</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>As this review concerns an educational intervention, serious adverse effects for study participants are unlikely. However, as adverse events were one of the primary outcomes of the study, these were searched for in the studies selected.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-20 10:42:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Substantial evidence shows that structured educational programmes such as the X-PERT patient programme and the DESMOND programme can be very effective for patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Deakin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deakin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skinner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 2006</LINK>). Behaviour-oriented patient education enhances patient empowerment, which enables patients to take responsibility for their diabetes and for other improvements in outcomes such as quality of life and lifestyle change (<LINK REF="REF-Lacey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2002</LINK>). National guidelines such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>) emphasise the need to utilise such programmes to improve patient outcomes. However, NICE also stresses that the success of such programmes is dependent on the personal and sociological background of patients, and that any such educational intervention should be tailored to patient groups or individuals.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-06 15:41:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the first review, which included 11 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 2008</LINK>), culturally appropriate health education provided to study participants with type 2 diabetes from ethnic minority communities produced a clinically significant improvement in glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)) at three and six months, yet this improvement was not sustained at one year. Other improvements were noted in total cholesterol levels at one year post intervention and in knowledge scores at three, six and 12 months post intervention. No significant differences in other outcome measures were reported. Since the time of the first review, research into the impact of culturally appropriate diabetes education has continued. The National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education in America now considers determining "the diabetes educational needs of the target population....such as ethnic background" as an essential standard in diabetes self-management education (<LINK REF="REF-Funnell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funnell 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the burden of disease of type 2 diabetes in ethnic minority groups, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of health interventions such as culturally appropriate health education. It is also important that those aspects of health education interventions that are effective in improving outcomes in ethnic minority communities are identified, so that lessons learned in one place and by one community can be adapted and used to benefit others, in terms of improving health outcomes and quality of life. One caveat to this philosophy is that it must be remembered that all minority communities are not the same, nor are all individuals within a community the same. Stereotyping can be avoided by taking generic messages from research and applying them in a culturally sensitive manner, working in partnership with minority communities to achieve the best outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Leedham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leedham 2000</LINK>). Another important aspect of health education to take into account is the possibility of negative or adverse effects of the intervention(s) and how these can be identified, thereby improving educational interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Pill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pill 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Study participants were people with type 2 diabetes mellitus of any duration of diagnosis, with or without complications of diabetes. To be consistent with changes in classification and diagnostic criteria of type 2 diabetes mellitus through the years, the diagnosis should have been established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Ideally, diagnostic criteria should have been described. If necessary, authors' definitions of diabetes mellitus were used. Diagnostic criteria were eventually subjected to a sensitivity analysis. Both male and female patients over 16 years of age were considered.<BR/>
<BR/>Participants belonged to ethnic minority communities residing in upper-middle-income and high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2013</LINK>). "Ethnic minority communities" refers to upper-middle-income and high-income countries with large numbers of residents from other countries, with identifiable differences in culture, religion or language, from the majority (or dominant) population and likely to be at a health disadvantage. The search for evidence of culturally appropriate health education was restricted to the following countries: European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, USA, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.<BR/>
<BR/>We have limited the review to these countries for the following reasons: Increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus amongst ethnic minority communities in these countries has been shown, large minority communities reside there (making it a significant public health issue) and these countries have a greater chance of having in place systematic population-based diabetes educational programmes. In addition, it is known that people from ethnic minority communities are often disadvantaged socioeconomically, have poorer linguistic abilities in the main language of the country and often poorer educational status and have greater difficulty accessing the healthcare provisions of the country in which they live. The ethnic minority group was considered in relationship to the ethnic dominant group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The effects of culturally appropriate (or adapted) health education for ethnic minority communities with type 2 diabetes mellitus were considered, both separately and in comparison with conventional diabetes health education. One of the interventions should be culturally appropriate to the intervention group or groups. We also considered interventions that compared two different types of culturally appropriate health education.</P>
<P>'Culturally appropriate' health education is defined here as education that is tailored to the cultural or religious beliefs and linguistic skills of the community being approached, taking into account likely literacy skills (<LINK REF="REF-Overland-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overland 1993</LINK>). It could include adapting established health education to innovative delivery methods, such as using community-based health advocates, delivering the information to same-gender groups or adapting dietary advice to fit the likely diet of a particular community.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparator</HEADING>
<P>We anticipate that 'conventional' diabetes education varies from one country to another, also acknowledging the different models of health education interventions. Therefore we are defining 'conventional' diabetes health education as 'any mode of delivery of health education that does not take into account the cultural background and context of the individual or group to whom the intervention is directed.' Thus conventional diabetes health education should be the 'usual' health education offered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the country being investigated. Educational intervention(s) could include any of the following: dietary advice; healthy lifestyle; information on smoking, exercise and weight reduction; and information on the use of screening services, foot care and self-monitoring of blood sugars and blood pressure.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2014-08-06 15:42:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Important clinical outcome measures for diabetes health education include morbidity and mortality rates, incidence and progression of diabetic complications and improvements in patient empowerment and health-related quality of life. However, the priority attached to these may vary, both among patients and within the healthcare system, for example, after the introduction of new guidelines in diabetes care, new treatments for diabetes are provided, along with additional financial incentives for healthcare staff for improving care provided to patients with diabetes.<BR/>
<BR/>In addition, it is difficult to quantify knowledge, skills and attitudes, although several validated questionnaires attempt to do so. Also various qualitative measures are available that can indicate the value and effectiveness of health education interventions.<BR/>
<BR/>The patient group consulted with regard to development of the protocol (Diabetes UK) has agreed with the proposed outcome measures.</P>

<P>Two review groups from The Cochrane Collaboration were asked for support and advice on the methodology of the review: The Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group is hosting the review and provided the bulk of support; the Consumers and Communication Review Group also provided valuable input and support for the patients' perspective in the review. In addition, opinion on the methodology of the review and in particular on the main outcome measures was given by Diabetes UK, the main UK diabetes consumer group. Diabetes UK read through the protocol and gave its opinion on which of the main outcome measures would be likely to be most relevant to consumers.</P>

<P>To determine which studies should be assessed further, two review authors (JC and MA) independently scanned the abstract, title or both sections of every record retrieved by the searches. JC was involved as the lead review author until November 2011, and MA was the lead review author between November 2011 and December 2013. KH was involved as a co-review author throughout the update. When differences in opinion were expressed, they were resolved by consensus. If resolving the disagreement was not possible, the article was added to the list of those 'awaiting assessment,' and we contacted study authors for clarification.<BR/>
<BR/>An article was rejected during this initial screening if the review author could determine from the title or abstract, or from both, that it did not meet the inclusion criteria. If rejection was not possible, full-text copies were retrieved. Differences between review authors' extraction results were resolved by discussion within the larger group. Study authors were contacted for clarification. All studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included unless serious methodological flaws made the data unreliable.</P>
<P>With guidance from the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Review Group, trials that had only an abstract available were treated with caution and were included only if it appeared that they were relevant to the review and after the study authors were contacted to obtain the full version.

In 23 papers, participants did not have type 2 diabetes (or the paper included mixed diabetic populations, which were not separated in the reporting of outcomes). Two studies were excluded because the intervention described was not culturally adapted (<LINK REF="STD-Heudebert-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Heudebert 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phumipamorn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Phumipamorn 2008</LINK>). Eight studies were excluded as they did not include clearly defined diabetes health education (<LINK REF="STD-Amaoko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Amaoko 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amaoko-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Amaoko 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Batik-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Batik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calles_x002d_Escandon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Calles-Escandon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hotu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hotu 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murrock-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Murrock 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruelas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ruelas 2009</LINK>). Six studies appeared ongoing, and no results were available at that time (<LINK REF="STD-Egede-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Egede 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Palmas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosal-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rosal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2012</LINK>). Four studies appeared relevant but did not contain any of the outcomes from our protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Barrera-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Barrera 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boudreau-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Boudreau 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2011</LINK>). Three studies were excluded because the interventions compared within these studies, although fulfilling the criteria for culturally appropriate health education, did not have a 'usual care' control group (<LINK REF="STD-Davidson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welch 2011</LINK>). In all three of these studies, the interventions within each study were essentially the same, and they differed only in terms of the intensity of the intervention and follow-up, thus data on the effects of the intervention itself were not provided. Two papers initially excluded were later included after the study authors provided a breakdown of included ethnic groups (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011-_x002d_-African-Ameri" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011 - African Ameri</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011_x002d_-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011- Hispanic</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-African_x002d_Amer" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 African-Amer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 Hispanic</LINK>). Data from both of these studies were therefore analysed as data from two separate smaller trials.</P>
<P>In all, 26 study authors (from 13 excluded studies and 13 included studies) were contacted by the review team. Three studies were excluded because the study authors were unable to provide missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Trief-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Trief 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinstock-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstock 2011</LINK>) or because information provided excluded them on the basis of the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hill_x002d_Briggs-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hill-Briggs 2011</LINK>). Seven studies were excluded because the study authors did not reply to requests for missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravis-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bravis 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cramer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cramer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crasto-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Crasto 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egede-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Egede 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2011</LINK>). One study author was initially contacted after our electronic search was completed, as the search located the protocol for that trial, which sounded suitable for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Powers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Powers 2009</LINK>). As the results of this study had not yet been published at this point, the study authors were contacted to provide preliminary results of their trial for inclusion in the review. They said that this may be possible; however, as our update took longer than anticipated, the results of this study were published in time for inclusion in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 2013</LINK>). One study author (<LINK REF="STD-Jernigan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jernigan 2011</LINK>) replied and referenced another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK>), which provided study data. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2012</LINK>) provided the reference to the full, now published results (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty-two new studies (analysed as 24 separate trials because of the two trials for which study authors provided us with separate data for Hispanic and African American participants) plus 11 studies from the original review were included in the review analysis. The total number of participants in these studies was 7453, with studies ranging in size from 20 to 1486 participants. Some studies were quite small and were designed as pilot studies. Four study authors provided additional data for the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bellary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bellary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011-_x002d_-African-Ameri" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011 - African Ameri</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011_x002d_-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011- Hispanic</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-African_x002d_Amer" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 African-Amer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 Hispanic</LINK>).</P>

<P>Participants were identified and recruited for the studies by several different methods and from different sources depending on the healthcare system of the host country, which determined where the target groups were likely to be found in the highest concentrations. In Britain and the Netherlands, studies recruited participants attending their general practitioners (or family doctors) (<LINK REF="STD-Baradaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baradaran 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Middelkoop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Middelkoop 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hare-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hare 2004</LINK>), secondary care diabetes clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1997</LINK>) and day care centres (<LINK REF="STD-Baradaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baradaran 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Six studies tailored health education to a preliminary, baseline evaluation of the level of knowledge of their target group.

Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2009</LINK>) were deemed by the study authors to use a purely interactive patient-centred method.

<P>Health education interventions were delivered by various combinations of healthcare workers, including link or community health workers (16 studies), dieticians (12 studies), nurses (16 studies), podiatrists (one study), psychologists (two studies), lay workers (four studies) and exercise physiologists (two studies). One study used a solely multimedia-based intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011_x002d_-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011- Hispanic</LINK>). <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK> shows the range of health education teams used to provide the programmes in these RCTs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration of interventions and follow-up</HEADING>
<P>The interventions lasted from one session (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1997</LINK>) to 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toobert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Toobert 2011</LINK>). The median duration of interventions was six months, whilst the mean duration was roughly eight months. Twelve studies followed up participants between one and three months after the start of the intervention. Twenty-two studies followed up participants between three and nine months after the intervention. Twelve studies collected data between nine and 18 months after the intervention. Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bellary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bellary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Eramo-Melkus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">D'Eramo Melkus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2013</LINK>) followed up participants for longer than 18 months from the start of the interventions. In two cases, the intervention groups were reassessed immediately after the intervention phase had been completed (<LINK REF="STD-Babamoto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Babamoto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2005</LINK>). Several studies mentioned the ethical dilemma they faced in asking a control group from a community that was needy and deprived to wait a significant period of time before they could benefit from the intervention, and serious worries arose that people would refuse to enter an RCT if they believed there was a good chance they would not benefit from it. Six studies used a delayed intervention for the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePue-2013" TYPE="STUDY">DePue 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Middelkoop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Middelkoop 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 Hispanic</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Middelkoop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Middelkoop 2001</LINK> was the only paper offering delayed intervention that collected data on that group afterwards, in the style of a cross-over study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of outcome measures used</HEADING>
<P>A variety of outcome measures were used by the various trials: diabetes-related biochemical blood values (HbA1c levels, lipid levels, blood glucose levels); results of validated attitudinal and behavioural questionnaires; knowledge of different diabetes-related topics; health-related quality of life measures; weight, body mass index (BMI) or waist-to-hip ratios; and blood pressure measurements. HbA1c was the most commonly measured outcome, as it was included in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Baradaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baradaran 2006</LINK>). Seventeen studies used blood pressure measurements as outcome measures, and 26 studies used a variety of different, but validated, before and after questionnaires asking for behavioural and attitudinal measures.<BR/>The degree of heterogeneity of the outcome measures in these studies is illustrated by the following example of assessing knowledge about diabetes, although some improvement has been described in studies using similar instruments since the time of the first review, thereby allowing a better comparison. Eighteen of the 33 studies assessed knowledge, and we identified 11 different instruments used to collect these data. The 24-item Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire specifically adapted for Hispanics was used most by various studies, with five studies utilising it (<LINK REF="STD-Babamoto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Babamoto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lujan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lujan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sixta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sixta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 2007</LINK>). The Diabetes Knowledge Scale was used by three different studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samuel_x002d_Hodge-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel-Hodge 2009</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Eramo-Melkus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">D'Eramo Melkus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rosal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toobert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Toobert 2011</LINK>) used validated quality of life measures, and most papers used different instruments. As the Diabetes Quality of Life Measure (DQOL) used in <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK> had a scale wherein a lower value inferred a positive outcome (which was opposite to results in the other studies), this value was inverted in the analysis. Five studies recorded hospital admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Babamoto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Babamoto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePue-2013" TYPE="STUDY">DePue 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2013</LINK>). Two studies recorded hypoglycaemic/hyperglycaemic episodes (<LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philis_x002d_Tsimikas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Philis-Tsimikas 2011</LINK>). No studies really addressed the long-term incidence of complications of diabetes or mortality rates (although 18 studies provided data on the number of participants who died during the study period); however given their relatively short follow-up times, this is not too surprising. Still only seven studies included in their discussions a rough estimate of the costs of the interventions post hoc, with only <LINK REF="STD-Bellary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bellary 2008</LINK> providing sufficient detail.</P>
<P>With respect to follow-up times, a variety of subtly different timings were used. The study authors, for the sake of some clarity, grouped these into immediate and three, six, 12 and 24 months by rounding them to the nearest point. For instance, an outcome measure at eight weeks would be rounded into the three-month category. This was seen as essential for any meaningful meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison groups</HEADING>
<P>The comparison groups in the selected studies tended to receive 'usual' care, which varied depending on the country of origin of the study and its healthcare system. Half of the studies' control groups received their usual care alone, with roughly half of those being "wait-listed" for the intervention, as described above. Control groups of the other studies received usual care plus a token non&#8211;culturally adapted intervention, such as mailed leaflets, newsletters and occasional telephone calls, to maintain interest. <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Eramo-Melkus-2010" TYPE="STUDY">D'Eramo Melkus 2010</LINK> actually held group sessions for the control group, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2009</LINK> delivered nurse-led home visits to the control group.<BR/>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Although some data could be determined from 18 studies with losses to follow-up reasons, only four studies investigated adverse events specifically and reported on whether they were secondary to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Bellary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bellary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePue-2013" TYPE="STUDY">DePue 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-African_x002d_Amer" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 African-Amer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 Hispanic</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Data from 28 of the 33 studies could be included in the meta-analyses. One paper could not be included, as no results were provided in the paper and the study author was not able to provide further information (<LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2009</LINK>). Three studies did not provide enough statistical information (e.g. no standard deviation/error, using a different method such as fixed-effect regression models) to be incorporated into the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Babamoto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Babamoto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carter-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePue-2013" TYPE="STUDY">DePue 2013</LINK>). Again study authors were contacted to provide the missing data, but we received no response. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Gucciardi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gucciardi 2007</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis because it was comparing group versus group and individual counselling and had no comparable study (the only other study to include this comparison was <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2002</LINK>, but the outcomes for the latter study were taken at six and 12 months, not at three months as in <LINK REF="STD-Gucciardi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gucciardi 2007</LINK>, and therefore were not statistically comparable).</P>
<P>Some sections of data were excluded from some studies, as they were a hybrid of two methodologies: <LINK REF="STD-Middelkoop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Middelkoop 2001</LINK> used an RCT method for the first six months, then changed to a 'controlled before and after study' method for the next 12 months; <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK> used an RCT of a diabetes self-management group intervention for the first six months, followed by telephone reinforcement of only the intervention arm assessed at 18 months. For <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005</LINK>, we used data from the first six weeks of the study only, as the wait-list control group was offered the culturally appropriate health education intervention at this point and from then on was no longer a control group. <LINK REF="STD-Baradaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baradaran 2006</LINK> included more than two arms in the RCT: the intervention group and two control groups&#8212;one local white Caucasian and one South Asian. Participants in the white control group were not randomly assigned, and the results for that group were excluded from the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2002</LINK> also had three arms: an intervention group that received care in the clinic and community, an intervention group that received care in the clinic only and the control group (minimal intervention). We decided to compare the most intensive intervention (clinical plus community care) with the control (usual care) group, as part of the main analysis.</P>

<P>Psychosocial measures such as health-related quality of life (QoL), knowledge of diabetes and so forth were assessed by various studies using a diversity of questionnaires, each assessing different aspects of these outcomes (e.g. knowledge of nutrition, knowledge of disease, knowledge of complications, monitoring of blood glucose, self-efficacy in management or in diet). For each study, we chose one psychosocial outcome measure identified from the main focus of the study in question. For example, we included the outcome 'attitudes towards perceived seriousness of diabetes' in the <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005</LINK> study, omitting other attitudinal outcome measures. For the <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2005</LINK> studies, we included results for mental QoL but did not include social QoL. For <LINK REF="STD-Rosal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rosal 2005</LINK>, we included the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL), but not global or specific QoL scores. For <LINK REF="STD-Baradaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baradaran 2006</LINK>, we selected attitudes towards seriousness of the condition and omitted attitudes towards complications. For <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Toobert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Toobert 2011</LINK>, we included results for self-efficacy but excluded those for self-care management, problem solving and stress management practice.</P>
<P>We excluded data that were outside of the outcome assessment points and could not be incorporated into the existing ones. Although both <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK> presented data on emergency department visits, this information was provided at different time frames and not in statistically comparable formats. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK> presented data at 36 months, which was well beyond the two-year outcome assessment point; <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 2007</LINK> presented data at eight and 12 weeks, so we included just the 12-week data. <LINK REF="STD-Lorig-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lorig 2008</LINK> presented data on satisfaction, but these could not be included, as no comparable data were provided by other studies. <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK> presented what the study authors believed were anomalous data for baseline values and standard deviations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and serum triglyceride values of the control groups, so all data for LDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides were excluded from the analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of selection bias</HEADING>
<P>All studies included in the meta-analysis were RCTs; therefore selection bias should have been minimised. Half of these studies adequately explained their randomisation process using an approved method, whilst the other half did not adequately describe their method of randomisation. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Middelkoop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Middelkoop 2001</LINK>) described an inadequate method of randomisation (using alternative dates of birth). In contrast, only six studies adequately described their allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samuel_x002d_Hodge-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel-Hodge 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most studies published detailed baseline data, often with P values or similarities between groups to highlight pre-intervention differences. Several studies demonstrated statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups in baseline characteristics such as gender and, most commonly, age (<LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samuel_x002d_Hodge-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel-Hodge 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2011-Hispanic" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2011 Hispanic</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toobert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Toobert 2011</LINK>), but none seemed so different as to warrant concern for the validity of the study.

<P>The studies used various outcomes, both subjective and objective. HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, serum cholesterol and hospital visits were among those classed as objective, whilst health-related quality of life, knowledge and self-efficacy were the main subjective outcomes. Objective measures with standardised methods of collecting, such as blood tests and automated blood pressure readings, were deemed at low risk of detection bias, as knowledge of a participant's group was considered unlikely to affect the outcome. Those that required levels of rounding (such as BMI and waist circumference) and a more subjective method of measurement (such as manual blood pressure) were deemed at unclear risk of detection bias when performed by non-blinded staff. All subjective measures used self-reporting as a method of detection (such as using questionnaires) and thus were deemed at high risk of detection bias, as the participants were never blinded. As all studies fell into this category, data were comparable, if not likely to overestimate the effects of the intervention. Those that were deemed to have an unclear risk of bias included no subjective measures or no relevant data in the meta-analysis.</P>

The reasons for those lost to follow-up were largely heterogeneous and ranged from family crises to emigration. None of the withdrawals or losses to follow-up were likely to be due to any interventional harm, given its nature, but more likely reflected differing local communities, the tenacity of the study authors and the nature of the intervention in engaging participants. As all studies used subtly different methodologies and interventions, it was impossible to correlate the attrition rate with a particularly successful method of intervention. The effects of the attrition rate can be examined by using a sensitivity analysis to eliminate those studies with high attrition rates.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Several possible subgroup analyses were identified in the protocol, to look at covariates, but data provided by the studies selected were not sufficient for evaluation of all. As a result, the following covariates were not investigated in the data: age, gender, educational status of participants, length of time since diagnosis of diabetes or presence or absence of diabetic complications. In addition, it was not always possible to identify the venue(s) at which the health education intervention took place, and indeed in some studies, a mixture of primary and secondary care venues was used for the convenience of participants, so venue could not be assessed.<BR/>However, it was possible to perform the following subgroup analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-015.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.32</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-10" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 10</LINK>), making some pragmatic decisions based on the low number of included studies and the different timing of collection of outcome measures, resulting in limitations to the types of comparisons that could be made.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Type of intervention used (comparison between studies): group, individual or combined. Combined education seemed to give the best short-term benefit for HbA1c, whereas group education seemed to give a more prolonged and cumulative benefit for HbA1c. Individual education in general was less effective at comparable endpoints; however it was the only method to show a statistically significant effect at two years because more data were available. The combined HbA1c was no longer statistically significant at one year, whereas the group showed its biggest reduction at one year. Scant data were available for comparison of total cholesterol or diabetes knowledge between these groups.</LI>
<LI>Type of health educator: Use of a community worker or a link worker showed a reduction in HbA1c at all endpoints, which was sustained at two years to almost the same degree as at three months and one year. A consistent increase in diabetes knowledge was demonstrated, although a significant reduction in cholesterol was evident only at one year. Use of a diabetes nurse also created a good reduction in HbA1c initially, but this finding was no longer significant at one year and was much reduced at two years. Participants showed little improvement in knowledge, but again cholesterol did become significantly reduced after one year, to the same extent as with community/link workers. Use of a dietician yielded the least reduction in HbA1c and cholesterol but did seem to increase knowledge to a comparable effect as the community/link workers. Based on this limited evidence, it seems that use of a community/link worker is more effective than use of a diabetes nurse, which in turn is more effective than use of a dietician.</LI>
<LI>Duration of intervention: Interventions that lasted less than three months lacked sufficient follow-up for study authors to comment on their effectiveness past six months. Meta-analysis of these studies showed no statistically significant change in HbA1c, knowledge or total cholesterol at three-month follow-up, although it did show some effects at six months in HbA1c and knowledge. Data for studies with an intervention lasting longer than three months are more convincing. They show a decrease in HbA1c at all follow-up points up to two years and an increase in knowledge at all follow-up points lasting up to one year. Again a reduction in cholesterol is seen but is not noticed until one year of follow-up. Based on these data, interventions lasting beyond three months seem to be more effective than shorter ones.</LI>
<LI>Healthcare system delivering the intervention (USA 27 studies vs remaining countries six studies; see <LINK REF="APP-10" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 10</LINK> and Discussion section): The paucity of data from outside of North America made comparing health systems virtually impossible. North American results largely tied in with results of the main analysis, with the exception of loss of statistical significance of improvement in HbA1c at two years because of the omission of the large-scale UK study (<LINK REF="STD-Bellary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bellary 2008</LINK>). When individual studies are taken into account, available data from Europe do seem broadly in line with those from the USA and Canada. However, the differing ethnic make-up in Europe as opposed to North America does mean that the two are not directly comparable, and so this is an area that needs further study. More research is needed to look at effects in different cultural contexts.</LI>
<LI>Differences between health education supplied to different ethnic minority groups&#8212;for these purposes, we have subdivided the studies into those aimed at South Asians, African Americans and Hispanic individuals: Most of the US studies looked at effects on Hispanic or African American populations, whilst all five European studies worked with South Asians. Broadly, the evidence appears to suggest that Hispanic populations are most likely to benefit in terms of glycaemic control from a culturally appropriate healthcare intervention and to maintain that improvement. These individuals showed a growing reduction in HbA1c sustained at one year. Although African Americans showed the largest reduction in HbA1c of nearly 1% at six months, no statistically significant changes were noted at one or two years. Data were insufficient for a clear analysis of differences in knowledge improvement between these ethnic groups, whilst cholesterol showed no statistically significant changes across the board. Available data were also insufficient for comparison of African American and Hispanic populations versus the South Asian population.</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-27 19:49:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Thirty-three RCTs of culturally appropriate health education for ethnic minority communities with diabetes from around the world were included in the review, including 11 from the original 2008 review. Culturally appropriate health education programmes improved glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) in participants from ethnic minority communities with type 2 diabetes mellitus, compared with those receiving 'usual care.' This improvement was seen at three (MD -0.4%, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2), six (MD -0.5%, 95% CI -0.7to -0.4), 12 (MD -0.2%, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.04) and indeed 24 months (MD -0.3%, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.1) post intervention. No studies followed up participants beyond two years or looked at diabetic complication rates. Of our other primary outcome measures, three studies reported on health-related quality of life and showed a significant improvement, and only four studies reported some data on adverse events.</P>
<P>No statistically significant change in total cholesterol, LDL or HDL was seen at any follow-up point. A statistically significant reduction in triglycerides of 24 mg/dL (95% CI -40 to -8) was noted at three months, but this was not sustained at six or 12 months, and so its clinical significance is doubted. Knowledge scores improved in the intervention group at three (SMD 0.4, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6), six (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.7) and 12 months (SMD 0.4, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) post intervention, thus showing a relatively stable retention of knowledge up to one year. No other differences were found in the other secondary outcome measures (participant-based outcomes or body mass index measurements), except for an increase in self-efficacy at six months (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). This was no longer present at the one-year follow-up point and therefore has doubtful clinical significance.</P>
<P>Some secondary outcome measures (such as development of diabetic complications and death rates) selected by the review authors at the protocol stage were not reported in any of the selected studies. Although rough estimates of cost per participant (ranging from $150 to $701, depending on the length of the intervention) were described in five studies, only one study included a cost-effectiveness comparison, so no meta-analysis could be done.<BR/>Examination of various subgroups (see <LINK REF="APP-10" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 10</LINK> or 'Subgroup analyses' above) yielded results (weighted towards HbA1c) in favour of using community health or link workers or nurses as a medium for the intervention, employing group or both group and individual sessions and using an intervention that lasted longer than three months. However, not enough comparable data were available to allow any strong recommendations from these analyses.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-06 16:14:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We aimed to identify the efficacy of using a culturally appropriate healthcare intervention for ethnic minority members with type 2 diabetes. The main limitation of the review was the variation between studies in terms of their interventions, differing outcomes and follow-up points and participant populace. This made highly powered meta-analysis difficult, as few of the 33 studies could offer results for all aspects of the review. However, the total number of included trials has tripled since the original review, allowing better quality data than were available before.</P>
<P>The review authors have attempted to minimise factors that may affect external validity: All trials are randomised, minimising selection bias; the trials were conducted at a variety of geographical locations across the world and within the United States itself; and studies with overlapping study groups have not been included in the same analysis (e.g. pilot studies and their follow-ups). In terms of external validity, results of this review apply most strongly to culturally appropriate healthcare interventions within North America, largely to Hispanic and African American groups, on which 24 of the 33 studies focused. There is nothing to suggest that the results could not be generalised to European South Asian minority groups; however we do not have sufficient data to confidently assert this (only five studies). Even a couple of study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Samuel_x002d_Hodge-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel-Hodge 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rosal 2011</LINK>) stated that their intervention probably would not be as successful in a different community, even if participants were of the same ethnicity. The existence of such heterogeneity between and within ethnic groups means that we would not be confident in generalising these results to smaller minority groups, those in less developed countries or those in countries with otherwise dramatically different cultures and/or healthcare approaches.</P>
<P>Another problem associated with trying to evaluate complex interventions is that we were highly inclusive in the variety of educational interventions permitted in the review. Although we have attempted to perform subgroup analyses, it is sometimes difficult to work out which aspects of the educational intervention or study population have generated the significant effect. Although previous evidence has suggested better outcomes with behaviour-centred interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Glazier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacey 2000</LINK>), we did not attempt to perform any analysis of the type of educational intervention or theory that was most effective, and it may not be true that all 'culturally appropriate health education' in type 2 diabetic individuals is effective.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-27 19:49:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The body of evidence presented here does confirm a prolonged decrease in HbA1c when a culturally adapted method of health care is used. The figures point to a reduction, maintained at two years post intervention, in the region of 0.2% to 0.5%. This is based on data from 26 studies with a total of 5724 participants. The consistent increase in knowledge was based upon available data from 13 of the 18 studies that measured it, with<I> </I>a total of 1496 participants. The endpoints for which no consistent change was observed were based on the following data: total cholesterol (11 studies; 1705 participants), systolic blood pressure (12 studies; 1896 participants), diastolic blood pressure (11 studies; 1578 participants), BMI (eight studies; 763 participants), self-efficacy (nine studies; 1546 participants) and health-related quality of life (three studies; 224 participants). As is evident, our HbA1c result is based on nearly three times more data than any other endpoint. The other outcomes are based on roughly similar numbers, with the notable exception being health-related quality of life, with only three of the seven studies reporting it providing adequate data. Increased risk of detection and experimenter bias noted by the study authors for all subjective outcomes in an unblinded intervention group diminishes reliability relative to the objective laboratory-based outcomes.</P>
<P>Although no adverse events occurred which were felt to be secondary to the intervention (and there are unlikely to be any due to the nature of the intervention); there was a general lack of reporting of adverse effects in most studies. Although data were available from 15 studies in the lost to follow-up information, mortality rates were not specified or investigated entirely in any of the studies meaning some information may have been missed. Furthermore, reasons for death were often not given and no long term reporting of mortality rate was carried out.</P>
<P>This review aimed to assess patient-based outcomes including health-related quality of life, diabetes knowledge, patient satisfaction, self-efficacy and patient attitudes. However, one key issue with this is that the study authors often used different tools and scales in their assessments, making comparability questionable (see <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>). Although we attempted to minimise this effect by researching the direction of the scale and its validity and by carrying out a sensitivity analysis of those studies providing inadequate information, the number of studies remaining often decreased the power of any effect found. Another limitation of the subjective measures is that when different assessment tools were used, it is not possible to quantify the magnitude of the improvement, only that an improvement was seen.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analyses carried out showed marginal and variable (increased or decreased) changes in effect size when certain studies were excluded, but this did not affect the overall outcome in most cases. The only situations in which the sensitivity analyses led to change in statistical significance of outcomes were diabetes knowledge at three months (a change to no significant effect, which changed to an improved effect at a later time point); BMI at six months (a change to a significant effect) and diastolic blood pressure at three months (a change to a significant effect).</P>
<P>In summary, we believe this leads to relatively high internal validity for HbA1c, a medium/high-strength judgement on knowledge and all other objective measures and weaker validity for health-related quality of life and self-efficacy, the latter being due to high risk of bias because of subjective variables and lower study numbers.</P>

<P>Although we did not restrict the search strategy to publications in English, all papers eventually included were published in English. Our inclusion criteria for the review were strict, particularly regarding randomisation of participants; this may have led to exclusion of non-randomised studies that potentially could have provided relevant information on the issues discussed in our review. However, an effort was made to analyse any non-randomised trials located, in case they could contribute to the discussion of our findings in context with other literature.</P>
<P>Although selection was discussed with a second review author (KH) and following a set protocol, different review authors (JC and MA) were responsible for selecting trials at different points in the update, which may have introduced some subjectivity in the selection of suitable studies. Also studies were excluded if health education was not 'clearly defined' or 'culturally adapted,' which was affected by subjective assessment of these definitions and may have led to unnecessary exclusion of some trials. We excluded studies with no clearly defined ethnic group; however the results may have offered some worthwhile information on the impact of culturally appropriate diabetes education on ethnic minorities as a whole. Also some studies were excluded as we were unable to obtain missing data after we failed to receive a reply from the study author.</P>
<P>Factors that may affect the internal validity of this review include experimenter bias, as all study groups were unblinded; differences in baseline characteristics between study groups (e.g. age of participants, gender ratio, BMI, pre-intervention HbA1c); smaller study numbers for certain outcomes; compensatory rivalry of the control group for the same blinding reason; and diffusion as ethnic groups are often close-knit communities and the studies are often carried out in the same city.</P>

<P>A recent systematic review by Glasgow et al (<LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 2013</LINK>) of non-pharmacological interventions in people of African descent has shown evidence of improved outcomes. The results of this review were also similar in that the power of the review was limited by significant heterogeneity between interventions and poor methodology and reporting of studies. A systematic review of strategies to improve response to cultural interventions in type 2 diabetes by Glazier et al (<LINK REF="REF-Glazier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazier 2006</LINK>) showed that more successful interventions used a community educator or layperson; were of high intensity (more than 10 contacts) and longer duration (longer than six months); and were provided one-to-one with individualised assessment. This correlates well with our review, except for the last point; our review was in favour of using either group or a combination of group and individual education. Evidence for group-based education has been found in other systematic reviews, meta-analyses and controlled trials, as described by Lirussi (<LINK REF="REF-Lirussi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lirussi 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of health education for patients with type 2 diabetes (not necessarily ethnic minorities) conducted on behalf of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (<LINK REF="REF-Loveman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loveman 2008</LINK>) showed the greatest improvement when a team of educators was used with a degree of reinforcement. As we did not consider an analysis of a combination of healthcare professionals/lay workers, we are unable to comment additionally on this evidence. Although this review showed a more variable effect on HbA1c than ours, it was similar in reporting improved knowledge but little effect on other outcomes such as BMI and lipid concentrations.</P>
<P>A realistic version of the original review showed increased retention of participants with one-to-one programmes and greater sustainability of long-term interventions, yet it also emphasised that no generic culturally appropriate education programme could be used with and between ethnic communities (<LINK REF="REF-Pottie-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pottie 2013</LINK>). We again have questioned the generalisability of some of the interventions in this review. However, many of the systematic reviews mentioned include studies up until 2008 and are based on studies from the original review; therefore this review provides additional and more robust evidence of effect.</P>

<P>Culturally appropriate diabetes health education in ethnic minority groups has results in significant improvements in HbA1c, triglycerides and knowledge about diabetes and its management. The 0.2% to 0.5% reduction in HbA1c due to the intervention with culturally appropriate diabetes education may contribute to a reduction of diabetic complications. With the results of this systematic review, it should be an integral part of evidence-based treatment recommendations. While pharmacotherapy may appear to achieve greater improvements in biochemical measures, we would argue that culturally appropriate diabetes education (both for ethnic minority groups and indeed for all people with type 2 diabetes) is vital to compliance with pharmacotherapy. Educational programmes should be an integral part of every treatment for diabetes.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In line with this, we have noticed a shift towards using multi-dimensional interventions (involving both health education and physician adjustment of medication) to target ethnic minority patients with poor diabetes self-management. This is demonstrated in two of the new trials that we identified (<LINK REF="STD-Bellary-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bellary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2009</LINK>), both of which used clinical algorithms to govern participant treatment. However, although no significant improvement was seen in the intervention group, multi-faceted interventions that combine culturally appropriate health education with monitoring of clinical risk factors and pharmacological therapy when indicated need further assessment in future randomised trials.</P>
<P>Although it is difficult to quantify the effects of improved participant knowledge, this in turn may have effects on other measures such as medication compliance, adverse events, hospital admissions and diabetic complications (all outcomes not analysed in our meta-analysis). It has been known for some time that diabetes health education improves knowledge about diabetes and about blood glucose control (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deakin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deakin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padgett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padgett 1988</LINK>), but this review has shown that culturally appropriate health education is better than 'normal' practice for minority communities. This does not mean only delivery of health education in the patients' mother tongue, but also adaptation of teaching and learning methods to suit cultural and community needs, as well as the content of the education itself (e.g. in dietary programmes) (<LINK REF="REF-Oomen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oomen 1999</LINK>). The results strengthen the belief, based on educational theory (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1994</LINK>), that health education should be coached in a learner-centred manner that respects religious, social and cultural values to have the greatest impact.</P>
<P>Given the available evidence, it is difficult to suggest a specific theoretical model as the most effective, and in light of the considerable overlap between various theories, it is likely that many models can be used with success. We would recommend that health education theory be considered when study authors are designing a culturally appropriate health education intervention, so that thought is given to the many factors besides knowledge that influence an individual&#8217;s behaviour. However, it is more important that interventions are designed on the basis of prior research or experience working with the target community, so that every intervention can be specifically tailored to the needs and requirements of each community.</P>
<P>We cannot yet identify which aspects of culturally tailored health education make the difference, although it appears from our subgroup analyses that use of a community health worker is the most effective means of delivering culturally appropriate health education, and it is likely to be the most cost-effective approach. However, the success of a community health worker in delivering health education is likely to depend on a number of factors, such as personal characteristics of the worker, quality of the training received and communities&#8217; attitudes towards education delivered by a non-professional. Therefore we would suggest that before community health workers are used to deliver education, they should receive substantial training from a certified diabetes educator, their work should be quality assured and prior research should determine whether their use in this way will be accepted by the specific community involved. This is in keeping with guidance provided by the UK Department of Health and Diabetes UK Patient Education Working Group (<LINK REF="REF-PEWG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEWG 2005</LINK>), which recommends four essential aspects of any educational intervention for diabetic persons: a structured written curriculum, trained educators, quality assurance and audit.</P>
<P>Although the original review showed that a combination of one-to-one and group education is better than either used on its own, this update has found mixed results; therefore it is difficult to make any recommendations in this area. Interventions over three months seemed to produce more effective outcomes than shorter interventions. However, we did not analyse the quantity of contact time needed to produce a significant effect.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-27 19:50:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Following on from the first review (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 2008</LINK>), this update on the effectiveness of culturally appropriate health education in ethnic minorities with type 2 diabetes has shown just how multi-faceted and complex analysis of educational interventions can be. More data are needed to determine which aspects of culturally appropriate health education are most effective. For example, a comparison of educational theories used or comparisons of different educational programmes should be performed. Data presented in the trials did not allow us to perform subgroup analyses of effects according to age or gender, and further information is needed as to whether culturally appropriate health education is still effective depending on age or gender.</P>
<P>With inclusion of data from 33 trials, we have presented evidence for the effect of culturally appropriate health education on HbA1c. However, given some doubt over the effects of intensively lowering HbA1c (<LINK REF="REF-Hemmingsen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemmingsen 2013</LINK>), we need further evidence on long-term real patient-important parameters, such as incidence of diabetic complications, especially cardiovascular effects and long term mortality for causes attributable to diabetes. In addition, lack of high-quality data about other outcomes such as health-related quality of life and self-efficacy is notable. The previous review highlighted the need to develop reliable and valid measurement tools in assessing such patient-centred outcomes; however, with often no mention of scale direction and validity for the study group being tested, this needs to be implemented further in future studies. In addition, utilising assessment questionnaires from previous trials will allow comparability between studies. Further qualitative reviews of studies looking at patient-centred outcomes are needed.</P>
<P>The problem of questionable external validity for some of the trials in this review could be overcome by completion of multi-centre trials, which would add greater strength to any argument of generalisability. Although we had an increased number of trials reporting the costs of their interventions, more information on this and more in-depth cost analyses would be useful in future trials. Many of the included studies did not report in sufficient detail their methodology (such as how participants were randomly assigned) or statistical analysis (such as power calculations or intention-to-treat). High-quality trials are needed to reduce the risk of bias that we witnessed in our meta-analysis. As with most interventions, adequate reporting of adverse events is essential to ensure no negative effect of the intervention has occurred, especially as desirable outcomes such as a reduction in HbA1c could result in life-threatening hypoglycaemic episodes. Investigating for adverse events should be part of the design for all such trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Final conclusions</HEADING>
<P>With the addition of 22 new studies to the previous 11, research on culturally appropriate health education for type 2 diabetes in ethnic minority groups has grown considerably since the time of the first review (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 2008</LINK>). This has strengthened the findings of the previous review of a significant effect on blood sugar control and knowledge and has shown a longer-lasting effect for blood sugar control of up to two years post intervention. However, the question remains as to how this translates into real health benefits over the long term (over two years) and how cost-effective such interventions are. More data are needed on other effects of culturally appropriate health education, such as effects on individuals and their attitudes toward diabetes.</P>
<P>If an intervention has been shown to improve patient care for ethnic minorities, then healthcare organisations need to take steps to facilitate its provision to ensure equality and fairness for ethnic minority populations. Therefore, when diabetic services are planned, culturally appropriate health education needs to be considered. However, there is still a need to ensure that the content of what is being delivered is based on educational theory, is structured and shows evidence of effectiveness for the target population.</P>

<P>The initial protocol considered six months, 12 months and two years as standard time intervals for assessment of outcome data. However, available data showed a high number of studies assessing outcomes at three months; this was discovered only after the protocol was written. Therefore three-month assessments were included in the main analysis for both the original review and the update review; otherwise a substantial amount of information would have been lost.</P>
<P>We had originally planned to perform subgroup analyses of several other covariates, including stratifying data by gender of educators, gender of participants, age group of participants, newly diagnosed versus established diabetes, literacy of participants and ability to speak the country's main language. However, this was not possible, as no studies stratified their data in this way. In addition, we planned to perform subgroup analyses of the setting in which the intervention took place (i.e. community vs hospital). However, it was not always possible to identify the venue(s) at which the health education intervention took place, and indeed in some studies, a mixture of primary and secondary care venues was used for the convenience of participants; therefore venue could not be assessed.</P>

Participants in the intervention group were followed up on average every 2 months in weekly clinics held by the practice nurse (extra practice nurse had protected time to run these clinics). All participants were contacted by a link worker before and between appointments to encourage clinic attendance. In addition, link workers attended clinics and provided interpretation and additional educational input in local languages (Punjabi, Urdu and Mirpuri). All link workers had attended a foundation course in diabetes management and care. Two community nurses (diabetes specialists) covered the 9 intervention practices and attended some of the clinics, providing additional educational and clinical support. The specialist nurse also monitored the standard of care provided by the practice nurse and link workers. The intervention provided protocols and targets to try to achieve</P>

<P>
<B>Treatment before study: </B>not stated</P>
<P>
<B>Setting:</B> CHW visited participants in their homes. Meetings with nurses were often in a community clinic, and baseline and 24-month assessments were carried out at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient General Clinic Research Center<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention: </B>The intensive intervention involved the use of both a nurse care manager (NCM) and a community health worker (CHW) team. The NCM is a registered nurse, who would see the participant at least once a year, usually in a clinic setting, focusing on aspects of health care that needed a specialist nurse (e.g. providing education regarding medication management, prompting physicians regarding suboptimal care patterns)</P>
<P>The CHWs were African American women familiar with Baltimore City who had not received previous health training. They were trained (by the NCM) for 6 weeks before the trial began. They scheduled home visits at least 3 times a year. CHWs would intervene to overcome problems (e.g. making frequent home visits to monitor and oversee medication taking, reviewing foods in family kitchens, arranging field trips to the grocery store to educate on healthy eating). CHWs would also participate in the completion of an intake assessment and plan for every participant, with particular attention to problems not traditionally addressed by medical or nursing care (e.g. difficulty filling out forms because of low literacy).</P>
<P>The intensive intervention was generally based on clinical algorithms, used to triage participants' level of control (as optimal, suboptimal, poor or very poor) and direct the initiation of specific intervention action plans (IAPs). Algorithms were available for blood glucose control, blood pressure control, lipid control, depressive symptoms, smoking, foot screening, blood glucose monitoring, socioeconomic issues (e.g. employment, housing, insurance, caregiver concerns), alcohol use and illicit drug use. Higher-risk participants (e.g., those in poor vs optimal control) receive more aggressive (e.g. physician is paged vs sent a written report; face-to-face meeting vs telephone call) and more frequent follow-up (e.g. every week vs every 2 weeks) to achieve better control (e.g. depressive symptom algorithm to assess depressive symptoms). If scores indicate no depressive symptoms, no action is taken and the participant is reassessed in 1 year. If scores indicate mild or moderate symptoms (and depression is diagnosed), the participant receives face-to-face education along with educational materials and is reassessed in 1 year. If scores indicate major or severe depressive symptoms, a report is sent to the participant's primary care doctor and the participant receives face-to-face education, along with educational materials. In this case, reassessment occurs sooner&#8212;at 3 months. If a participant indicates suicidal ideations, an at-risk protocol is implemented immediately in which a physician-on-call is paged.</P>
<P>Intervention action plans (IAPs) are implemented by NCMs and CHWs on the basis of clinical algorithms. After NCMs and CHWs have completed the initial intervention visit for each participant, they meet to discuss and implement a plan of care. Subsequent intervention contacts are initiated by the NCM and/ or the CHW as directed by participant needs, algorithms or IAPs. The NCM conducts a minimum of 1 face-to-face clinic visit per participant each year. Each CHW conducts at least 3 contacts per participant yearly with at least 1 of those 3 being a face-to-face home visit. At the end of the initial face-to-face contact and as needed thereafter, a written summary is sent to the participant&#8217;s primary care provider</P>
<P>
<B>Control:</B> Participants in the control group received a minimal intervention, which consisted of telephone calls every 6 months by a lay health educator to remind participants about important preventative diabetes-related health care (e.g. HbA1c tests, primary care). Control participants also received DM-specific information in the mail. The general aim of this minimal intervention was to make participants more involved in their health care</P>
<P>
<B>Provider:</B> Intervention is provided by a nurse care manager (a registered nurse) and a community health worker (African American women with no prior health education).</P>
<P>Control intervention telephone calls are provided by a lay health educator, who has had no previous health education training but has received 6 weeks of training</P>

Each lesson targeted a specific self-care objective. The programme also consisted of more than 160 testimonials from African American and Hispanic patients with diabetes related to diabetes self-care, emphasising barriers to care, challenges and personalised solutions that they or family members had encountered. Different testimonials and messages were used to relate both language and culturally appropriate information to African American or Latino users</P>

<B>Intervention:</B> was the 'Living Well with Diabetes Multimedia Program.' Aim of the intervention was to improve participants' diabetes self-management behaviours, therapy intensification and glycaemic control over a 3-month period</P>
<P>19 bilingual computer multimedia lessons on diabetes self-management: Content included an introduction to diabetes, blood glucose management, oral medications and insulin, nutrition and physical activity, depression and stress, oral hygiene and the prevention of complications (eye, foot, cardiovascular, kidney diseases). Each lesson targeted a specific self-care objective. The programme also consisted of more than 160 testimonials from African American and Hispanic patients with diabetes related to diabetes self-care, emphasising barriers to care and challenges and personalised solutions that they or family members had encountered. Different testimonials and messages were used to relate both language and culturally appropriate information to African American or Latino users</P>
<P>Programme available to participants in waiting areas before attending general education. Each lesson targeted a specific objective according to Gagne's theory of learning and the component display theory</P>
<P>
<B>Control:</B> given an American Diabetes Association brochure on self-management ("Living with Diabetes," written at 6th grade level)</P>

<B>Intervention:</B> a single 90-minute session with a bilingual medical assistant of Puerto Rican heritage. Medical assistant received approx. 40 hours of training in diabetes self-management before the session. Session was based on the Information-Behavioural Skills (IMB) model of health behaviour change. Information/Education was provided with use of a flip chart and interactive discussion. Culturally appropriate foods were used as examples as to what can raise blood glucose. Motivational interviewing was carried out to try to enhance motivation&#8212;this involved personalised feedback on self-care activities and open-ended query and exploration of self-care attitudes and beliefs. Behavioural skills were targeted and enforced using a teach-back method to ensure understanding</P>
<P>Each participant received a personal feedback report immediately after the session (contained self-generated reasons to change, agreed on goals, etc.) and a culturally tailored, individualised meal plan booklet. This was intended to promote positive attitudes about adhering to diet recommendations and therefore enhance participants' motivation to change. Participants were also provided with 0-3 handouts, depending on personal relevance as determined by the interventionist. Finally, all participants received a brochure of culturally familiar foods with recommended serving sizes</P>
<P>No further support was offered post intervention</P>
<P>
<B>Control:</B> Participants in the control group received usual care. However, this included an optional diabetes support group coupled with group-based didactic education delivered in Spanish. This support group was free, delivered on a monthly basis and facilitated by a bilingual diabetes community health worker of Puerto Rican heritage. This session was not tailored to the individual needs of the participant. Participants in the intervention arm could also attend this session</P>

<B>Intervention:</B> majority of intervention consisted of 12 biweekly group sessions, held at each church. Most sessions lasted between 90 and 120 minutes. Before each session, participants had their blood glucose checked and blood pressure checked and received feedback about their results. Each session opened with a prayer, followed by the main educational component of the session. Each session also involved a short physical activity segment (15 minutes, using chair exercises) and taste testing of 1 or 2 recipes. The format for sessions included small-group activities designed to be acceptable to persons with very limited literacy skills and those unaccustomed to group education/interactions. Therefore sessions were interactive, included lots of visual and hands-on activities, involved limited writing, used a game format for teaching nutrition concepts when feasible and included opportunities for participants to share their successes and struggles with efforts to change behaviours<BR/>Before the 12 sessions, participants had a 60-minute individual counselling session with a registered dietician to assess their usual dietary, physical activity and self-management behaviours, to initiate counselling and to facilitate subsequent counselling. The church diabetes advisor phoned participants monthly to offer support for behaviour change to improve diabetes self-management</P>
<P>Finally, to try to co ordinate the intervention with participants' primary care physician, study staff sent 3 postcard messages of encouragement to participants on behalf of their primary care physician during the first 8 months of the study. Postcard messages were tailored to behavioural goals selected by participants and included brief messages relevant to dietary behaviour, physical activity and HbA1c</P>
<P>
<B>Control: </B>Control group received minimal intervention, which included mailing to participants of 2 pamphlets ("Healthy Eating" and "Staying Active"), published by the American Diabetes Association, and 3 bimonthly newsletters providing general information and study updates</P>
<P>
<B>Provider: </B>A registered dietician on the study staff led the first 7 group sessions with the assistance of a Church Diabetes Advisor (CDA). The CDA was a peer counsellor with type 2 diabetes, or who had lived with someone diagnosed with diabetes for at least 2 years. CDAs were selected on the basis of recommendations of the pastor and were trained over a 1-month period (4 weekly 4-hour sessions) in the areas of motivational interviewing techniques, listening skills, diabetes self-management and telephone counselling.</P>
<P>The educational components of sessions 8 to 11 were led by a health professional from the local community who was identified and invited to participate by the CDA. For the last session, participants were given the option to choose a health-related presentation or to have a potluck meal. The individual counselling session at the start was led by a registered dietician</P>

<B>Intervention:</B> Intervention consisted of 4 60-minute fortnightly home visits by a nurse to participant's house. Intervention was symptom-focused and involved teaching and counselling. Each session was guided by a different module: (1) symptoms of hyperglycaemia, (2) symptoms of hypoglycaemia, (3) numbness and tingling in the feet/foot pain and (4) prevention of cardiovascular symptoms. The intervention was individualised by allowing participants to choose in what order they addressed symptoms and what management strategies they used. Intervention was made culturally appropriate by incorporating women's own coping strategies (e.g. spirituality, importance of family) and allowing time for women to tell their own stories about living with diabetes. In addition, an advisory board of 6 African American women living in similar communities as participants guided development of study materials.</P>
<P>Booster intervention started after 6 months (about 3 months after intervention finished) and consisted of 4 telephone calls by nurse who had carried out intervention at intervals of about 2-3 weeks</P>
<P>
<B>Control:</B> Control participants also received 4 60-minute fortnightly home visits by a nurse (a different nurse from the one who carried out the symptom-focused intervention). However, instead of a symptom-focused intervention, the control group received a weight and diet program. The 4 modules delivered across the 4 sessions were weight maintenance (2 modules), fat modification and sodium modification. Participants were taught skills to enhance diabetes self-care (e.g. reading labels, determining portion sizes). This intervention was also individualised and was culturally tailored. It was expected that this intervention would not be effective, but actually it was, probably because it was individualised to each participant</P>
