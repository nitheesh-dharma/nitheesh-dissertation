<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is immunotherapy an effective and safe treatment for diabetic amyotrophy?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Diabetic amyotrophy, which is also known as diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, diabetic femoral neuropathy or Bruns-Garland syndrome, is an uncommon disorder of the peripheral nerves (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord) that occurs in people with diabetes. The condition causes pain and weakness in the legs, mostly the muscles at the front of the thigh. Some researchers have found that blood vessels become inflamed and have suggested that this interrupts blood supply to the nerves. Medicines that target immune cells could be helpful.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found only one completed trial, which included 75 people who received methylprednisolone or a placebo. However the results have not been fully published and were not available for further scrutiny. The published abstract did not report adverse events. There is presently no evidence from any trial to show whether immunotherapies may benefit people with this condition.</P>
<P>We await results from trials to show whether corticosteroids, immunoglobulin or other treatments that act on the immune system have an effect in the treatment of diabetic amyotrophy.</P>
<P>Searches are up to date to September 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-15 13:19:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with diabetes mellitus (DM) sometimes present with acute or subacute, progressive, asymmetrical pain and weakness of the proximal lower limb muscles. The various names for the condition include diabetic amyotrophy, diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathies, diabetic femoral neuropathy or Bruns-Garland syndrome. Some studies suggest that diabetic amyotrophy may be an immune-mediated inflammatory microvasculitis causing ischaemic damage of the nerves. Immunotherapies would therefore be expected to be beneficial. This is the second update of a review first published in 2009.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-02-06 17:41:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 5 September 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also contacted authors of relevant publications and other experts to obtain additional references, unpublished trials, and ongoing trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-14 11:22:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We intended to include all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of any immunotherapy in participants with the condition fulfilling all the following: diabetes mellitus as defined by internationally recognised criteria; acute or subacute onset of pain and lower motor neuron weakness involving predominantly the proximal muscles of the lower limbs; weakness that is not confined to one nerve or nerve root distribution; and exclusion of other causes of lumbosacral radiculopathies and plexopathy.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-15 13:20:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found only one completed placebo-controlled trial (N = 75) using intravenous methylprednisolone in diabetic amyotrophy (<A HREF="Dyck 2006">Dyck 2006</A>). The results have not been fully published and were not available for analysis. The risk of bias was unclear because there was too little information to make a judgement, but we considered the trial at high risk of selective reporting. The published abstract did not report adverse events. We found no additional trials when the searches were updated in September 2016.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-19 17:48:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-14 11:22:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) reaches 50% for people who have had diabetes mellitus (DM) for more than 25 years (<LINK REF="REF-Sugimoto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugimoto 2000</LINK>). The most common form of DPN is a symmetrical, predominantly sensory polyneuropathy with distal onset and slow proximal progression. A less common but well-described form of the condition presents with acute or subacute, progressive, asymmetrical pain and weakness of the proximal lower limb muscles. This has been known as diabetic amyotrophy (DA), Bruns-Garland syndrome, diabetic myelopathy, diabetic mononeuritis multiplex, diabetic polyradiculopathy, femoral or femoral-sciatic neuropathy of diabetes, diabetic motor or paralytic neuropathy, proximal diabetic neuropathy, diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy or diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathies. The different names reflected uncertainty about the anatomical involvement and pathophysiology of the condition. Ischaemic injury, metabolic derangement, and inflammation have been proposed as causes. Many workers have also proposed that the condition has different clinical subtypes with different pathophysiology. Recent studies have helped to characterise its clinical and pathological features.</P>
<P>The lifelong incidence of DA is estimated to be 1% among people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hare-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hare 1994</LINK>). It generally affects middle-aged or elderly people with type 2 DM. It may occur soon after diagnosis or be the presenting complaint that leads to the diagnosis of DM. Pain and weakness are the major symptoms at presentation and often begin proximally in a lower limb before progressing to other segments and the contralateral limb. The distal and proximal segments in both lower limbs may become affected to similar degrees. Severe pain occurs early, while weakness accompanied by muscle atrophy become the predominant features later. Most people have significant weight loss. Sensory symptoms of paraesthesia, allodynia and autonomic dysfunction may also be present. Some people have associated thoracic radiculopathies or upper limb weakness. The condition usually runs a monophasic course that can be protracted (up to three years) with the pain and weakness often causing significant disability. Recovery of function occurs without medical treatment in nearly everyone but may be slow and incomplete (<LINK REF="REF-Coppack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coppack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cerebrospinal fluid of people with DA is usually acellular with a raised protein level. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates may be increased. Nerve conduction studies mainly show decreased amplitudes of lower limb motor and sensory action potentials and electromyography usually shows evidence of denervation in affected muscles, including paraspinal and thoracic-innervated muscles. Mildly prolonged distal latencies and F-wave minimal latencies as well as mild slowing of conduction velocities may be encountered. Biopsies of sural, superficial peroneal and lateral femoral nerves found features of ischaemic nerve injury and inflammatory infiltrates as well as immunoglobulin and complement depositions in the small blood vessel walls (<LINK REF="REF-Said-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Said 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llewelyn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llewelyn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelkar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelkar 2000</LINK>). These suggest that the pathogenesis is due to immune-mediated microvasculitis. <LINK REF="REF-Kawamura-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawamura 2008</LINK> studied sural nerve biopsies of people with DA and found increased expression of different inflammatory mediators in different cells at different disease stages, suggesting sequential involvement of the mediators in an immune-mediated inflammatory process.<BR/>
</P>
<P>A number of conditions share similar features but have unclear relationships with DA. Non-diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is a condition occurring in non-diabetic people that has similar clinical features, course, laboratory findings and outcome as DA (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 2002</LINK>). In diabetic neuropathic cachexia, people have weight loss and lower limb pain but no weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Ellenberg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellenberg 1974</LINK>). Occasionally, people with diabetes may present with progressive symmetrical bilateral proximal and distal lower limb weakness with little or no pain. It is uncertain if this represents a subtype of DA or the occurrence of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) in DM. It has also been suggested that in the insidious onset symmetrical subtype of the condition, metabolic factors (hyperglycaemia) may be responsible for its pathophysiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chokroverty-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chokroverty 1977</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="REF-Garces_x002d_Sanchez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garces-Sanchez 2011</LINK> found features of ischaemic injury and microvasculitis in the nerve biopsies of such individuals, similar to biopsies in people with DA.</P>
<P>Consistent with an immune-mediated microvasculitis pathogenesis, retrospective studies and prospective case series have suggested that immunotherapy for DA may be effective in reducing pain and improving strength (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krendel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krendel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaradeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaradeh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilfoyle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilfoyle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamburin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamburin 2009</LINK>). At present, to our knowledge and following extensive searching, only one randomised study, in which intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) was used, has been completed (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for a PRISMA flow chart showing the study selection process for this (second) update. We identified 73 new records (Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register 14, CENTRAL 4, MEDLINE 36, and Embase 19) and removed one duplicate. We identified no full-text reports for evaluation but included one trial, reported only as an abstract, in the review. We identified no ongoing studies.</P>
<P>For the first version of the review, searches on MEDLINE and Embase using the adopted strategies returned 476 and 1159 results respectively. We ran a more specific search for the first update which retrieved 177 references from MEDLINE, 49 from Embase, none from CENTRAL and 16 from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register.</P>

<P>We found only one completed controlled trial using intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in diabetic amyotrophy (DA) (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 2006</LINK>). The results have been published in abstract form. This was a multicentre, double-blind controlled trial of intravenous MP in DA (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Seventy-five participants (44 men and 31 women) with a mean age of 65.3 years (range 36 to 81) were included. Forty-nine participants received MP, initially 1 g three times weekly, with decreasing dosage and frequency over 12 weeks, while 26 participants received placebo. Age, gender, diabetes type, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and impairments (Neuropathy Impairment Scale (NIS) or NIS lower limbs (NIS (LL))) in the two groups of participants were not significantly different at baseline. Participants were assessed at intervals from baseline until week 104.</P>
<P>A previously ongoing controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in DA (NCT00004407) was not finished due to the lack of the intervention drug (IVIg) and funding.

<P>The results of one multicentre, double-blind controlled trial of intravenous MP, involving 75 participants, have been presented in abstract form but not fully published (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 2006</LINK>).

<P>Prior to the controlled trial using intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in diabetic amyotrophy (DA) (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 2006</LINK>), several case series reported benefits of immunotherapy in improving pain and strength (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), though one did not.</P>
<P>A total of 15 people from the patient series of <LINK REF="REF-Said-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Said 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Krendel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krendel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Kilfoyle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilfoyle 2003</LINK> were treated with corticosteroids alone. Twelve people were considered to have improved with treatment. Said and colleagues treated three people with prednisolone: all three had rapid relief of pain within days after treatment. One had no weakness; the strength in the other two recovered over several months. <LINK REF="REF-Kilfoyle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilfoyle 2003</LINK> treated 10 episodes of DA in nine people with oral or intravenous MP. They received 500 mg of MP daily for two days every two weeks for up to three months. In six episodes, there was a marked improvement in pain within days of starting treatment. Pain resolved in seven episodes within three months of symptoms onset. Moderate or severe weakness resolved or markedly improved after three months of treatment in seven episodes. The authors considered that these improvements occurred faster than the expected natural history of DA. Treatment started within two months of symptom onset was associated with rapid improvement in pain, while treatment within four weeks of symptom onset resulted in rapid improvement of both strength and pain. <LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 1997</LINK> did not report any adverse effects. Two people in the <LINK REF="REF-Said-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Said 1994</LINK> series had an increase of glycaemia requiring insulin administration. Among the six people that received prednisolone in the <LINK REF="REF-Krendel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krendel 1995</LINK> series, five had increased requirements or a new requirement for insulin to control glycaemia, one had heart failure, one had corticosteroid myopathy, one had insomnia, one had gastrointestinal haemorrhage and one committed suicide during treatment. Similarly in the <LINK REF="REF-Kilfoyle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilfoyle 2003</LINK> series, administrations of MP were associated with transient asymptomatic hyperglycaemia and one person required temporary insulin treatment. Another person had mild transient elevation of blood pressure and visual hallucination. Insomnia and irritability were also reported during MP treatments.</P>
<P>Monotherapy with IVIg was given to a total of 17 people from the patient series of <LINK REF="REF-Krendel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krendel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Jaradeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaradeh 1999</LINK>. All were considered to have improved from treatment. Only <LINK REF="REF-Krendel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krendel 1995</LINK> reported adverse effects: two people had a rash and one had staphylococcal sepsis.</P>
<P>Plasma exchange (PE) as monotherapy was given to 14 people from the <LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Jaradeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaradeh 1999</LINK> series. All except one improved.</P>
<P>The 15 people in the <LINK REF="REF-Krendel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krendel 1995</LINK> series were treated after their DA had progressed for between one to 15 months (average five months). Eight were given IVIg, three were given prednisolone, two were given a combination of IVIg and prednisolone, one had a combination of IVIg, prednisolone and IV cyclophosphamide and another a combination of IVIg and IV cyclophosphamide as initial therapies. In all cases, worsening stopped when treatment began and there was a subsequent improvement in strength of at least one grade on the Medical Research Council scale. Performance of activities of daily living improved in at least 12. Recovery was complete or nearly complete in five people.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 1997</LINK> retrospectively reviewed 44 people with DA seen over a 12-year period. Of 12 people who received immunotherapy, nine (75%) had improvement but 17 of 29 untreated people with DA (59%) also eventually improved. They considered those treated to have had greater deficits but faster and greater improvement than those who were untreated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Jaradeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaradeh 1999</LINK> treated 15 people with diabetes and progressive polyradiculoneuropathy with immunotherapy. Nine received PE, six received IVIg. All had proximal and distal lower limb weakness which was often asymmetrical. Most had pronounced radicular pain and significant weight loss. These features suggest the diagnosis of DA. However, of the eight people who had proximal and distal upper limb weakness, two also had facial weakness and another two required respiratory assistance, and may have had a condition closer to chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. After immunotherapy, all of those studied had no further deterioration and had dramatic subjective improvement, in particular rapid resolution of their pain. The improvement in neuropathy disability score weakness subset (NDSW) averaged 9.0 (SD 5.1) points at week six, and 29.1 (SD 9.3) points by week 52.</P>
<P>In a prospective case series (<LINK REF="REF-Tamburin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamburin 2009</LINK>), five people with severe pain from DA received IVIg treatment after having no response to symptomatic therapy for pain and corticosteroids. Four had a decrease in pain. The authors report that scores on a visual analogue scale for pain, the Medical Research Council scale for lower limb strength and walking distance improved significantly at one month.</P>
<P>In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Zochodne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zochodne 2003</LINK> reported a person who developed DA while on a immunosuppressive regimen consisting of ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil for an allograft cardiac transplant and two people with DA who did not respond to IVIg treatments.</P>
<P>Because the natural history of DA is that of spontaneous improvement, it is not possible to be certain from case series if immunotherapy had improved the condition. The single completed intravenous MP controlled trial suggested that MP may help neuropathic symptoms but does not hasten recovery of strength (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 2006</LINK>). However, the study data are unpublished. There is an urgent need for the data to be peer reviewed and published. Future trials are also necessary to investigate the effect of earlier treatment, different immunotherapeutic agents, dosages and schedules.</P>
<P>Recent studies have increased the evidence for immune-mediated inflammatory microvasculitis causing ischaemic damage to nerves as the pathogenic process in DA. Early institution of immunotherapy may therefore be expected to improve the condition.</P>
