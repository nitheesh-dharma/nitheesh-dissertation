<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-12 09:52:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Broken bones (fractures) that do not heal or unite quickly or completely can result in significant pain and loss of function. This may affect the person's ability to work and an associated reduction in their quality of life. There is also a considerable economic burden to society associated with delayed union (healing) or nonunion of fractures. The intervention tested in this review is bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). This is produced naturally by the body and it has been shown to play an important role in bone and cartilage formation. The review set out to find whether BMP applied at the fracture site can help to speed up and improve fracture healing.</P>
<P>The review included 11 trials. All were flawed which means that their results may be biased. Four trials involved people with acute fractures of the tibia (shin bone). Evidence from these trials showed that BMP may enhance healing of these fractures, and that people with these fractures when treated with BMP required fewer subsequent procedures. Six trials testing BMP for fractures that had not healed during first course of treatment (nonunions) showed BMP was neither better or worse at healing than bone grafts. One small trial found no difference between BMP and done grafts in people whose bone had been cut so in order to treat a healed but misaligned fracture. Trial participants who received BMP experienced similar adverse effects to those no receiving BMP (infection, hardware failure, heterotopic bone formation and immunogenic reactions). However, patients given BMP instead of bone autografts will have avoided problems associated with extraction of the bone from another site in their body.</P>
<P>The review also included four economic evaluations. Three of these found that the costs associated with using BMP, based on one large trial of acute open tibia fractures, were likely to be higher than standard care treatment without BMP. The difference in costs decreased with increased fracture severity.</P>

<P>Eleven RCTs, all at high risk of bias, and four economic evaluations were included. Apart from one study, the times to fracture healing were comparable between the BMP and control groups. There was some evidence for increased healing rates, without requiring a secondary procedure, of BMP compared with usual care control in acute, mainly open, tibial fractures (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.43). The pooled RR for achieving union for nonunited fractures was 1.02 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.15). One study found no difference in union for patients who had corrective osteotomy for radial malunions. Data from three RCTs indicated that fewer secondary procedures were required for acute fracture patients treated with BMP versus controls (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83). Adverse events experienced were infection, hardware failure, pain, donor site morbidity, heterotopic bone formation and immunogenic reactions. The evidence on costs for BMP-2 for acute open tibia fractures is from one large RCT. This indicates that the direct medical costs associated with BMP would generally be higher than treatment with standard care, but this cost difference may decrease as fracture severity increases. Limited evidence suggests that the direct medical costs associated with BMP could be offset by faster healing and reduced time off work for patients with the most severe open tibia fractures.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-04 12:34:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>This review highlights a paucity of data on the use of BMP in fracture healing as well as considerable industry involvement in currently available evidence. There is limited evidence to suggest that BMP may be more effective than controls for acute tibial fracture healing, however, the use of BMP for treating nonunion remains unclear. The limited available economic evidence indicates that BMP treatment for acute open tibial fractures may be more favourable economically when used in patients with the most severe fractures. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-07 10:43:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A fracture is a broken bone. Most fractures heal within 20 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Littenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littenberg 1998</LINK>). The time to fracture union depends on a number of factors, including: severity of injury, presence of an open wound, number of fracture fragments, associated vascular injury, part of the bone fractured and method of fracture treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dervin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dervin 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fracture that does not heal in the time expected, as established by the clinician, is considered a delayed union. The rate of delayed unions varies by fracture severity from 16% to 60% for less severe fractures (Gustilo-Anderson types I to IIIA) to 43% to 100% for more severe fractures (Gustilo-Anderson types IIIB and IIIC) (<LINK REF="REF-Caudle-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caudle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riemer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riemer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1994</LINK>). A fracture that demonstrates motion at the bony ends and is not completely healed within six months is considered a nonunion (<LINK REF="REF-Limb-Centre-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limb Centre 2009</LINK>). Nonunions can lead to significant pain, inhibition of function and decreased personal and professional productivity (i.e. paid and unpaid) (<LINK REF="REF-Friedlaender-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedlaender 2004</LINK>), with the potential for associated reductions in patients' health-related quality of life. The rate of nonunions has been reported to range from 4% to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedlaender 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Littenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littenberg 1998</LINK>). Factors contributing to delayed union or nonunion can include: severe comminution (shattered or splintered bone), open fractures, association with tumour, infection, insufficient immobilisation, inadequate blood supply, poor nutrition or chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Schoelles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoelles 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fracture is considered open when the bone protrudes through the skin, which increases risk of infection. The estimated incidence of open fractures, based on an epidemiological study conducted from 1988 to 1994 in Edinburgh UK, is 23 per 100,000 population per year. Fifty-four percent of open fractures involve fractures of the phalangeal (fingers and toes) or tibial (shin bone) diaphysis (shaft) (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 1997</LINK>). The severity of open fractures are graded using the Gustilo-Anderson system. Grade I (least severe) is a puncture wound and grade IIIC (most severe) is a large open wound with an arterial injury necessitating vascular repair. A higher grade leads to a higher risk of amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Caudle-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caudle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riemer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riemer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1994</LINK>). In grade IIIB open fractures there can be up to a 50% infection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2001</LINK>). The severity of an open fracture is determined by the energy level of impact, degree of contamination, degree of soft tissue injury, complexity of fracture pattern and vascular injury (<LINK REF="REF-Limb-Centre-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limb Centre 2009</LINK>). A critically sized defect is a defect in a long bone, the size of which inevitably leads to a non-union, where the absolute length depends on the bone.</P>
<P>Fractures resulting from injury place an important economic burden on health and social care systems (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 2008</LINK>), as well as on individuals and employers. In the USA, long bone fractures are estimated to comprise 10% of all non-fatal injuries and incur the largest proposition of inpatient expenditures on injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Kanakaris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanakaris 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Vyrostek-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vyrostek 2004</LINK>). Treatment of both acute and nonunion fractures can be expensive, with patients treated for long-bone fracture nonunion typically submitted to frequent hospital admissions and a number of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Dahabreh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahabreh 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Kanakaris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanakaris 2007</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-11 09:45:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) may have an important role in bone and cartilage formation, fracture healing and repair of other musculoskeletal tissues. Part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) superfamily, they are proteins secreted by cells, which serve as signalling agents that influence cell division, matrix synthesis and tissue differentiation. The cloning of the human BMP-2 sequence led to the ability to manufacture large quantities of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) for clinical use (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are two BMPs clinically available: BMP-7 (also known as osteogenic protein-1 or OP-1) supplied by Stryker UK, which uses a bovine collagen carrier in granular form (OP-1 Putty in the US and Osigraft® in the UK), and rhBMP-2 supplied by Wyeth Research Ltd, which uses a collagen sponge carrier (InFUSE in the US and InductOs in the UK). These collagen carriers allow slow release of the BMP over time. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-05-05 14:08:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>In acute fractures, delayed union and fracture nonunions, it is possible to induce bone at the fracture site to assist healing. Autogenous iliac crest bone graft (AICBG), is considered the current best-practice graft for bone induction (<LINK REF="REF-Szpalski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szpalski 2005</LINK>) because it has the three properties required for bone formation; osteogenicity (ability to form bone), osteoconductivity (allow bone to grow along) and osteoinductivity (bring about bone formation). Since the bone is taken from the patient, it is both histocompatible and nonimmunogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Arrington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrington 1996</LINK>). However, there are several disadvantages to using autogenous bone. Because the graft is taken from the patient, there is a limited amount of bone available, and when the patient has had previous bone grafts, the remaining volume of iliac crest bone may not be sufficient to induce bone at the fracture site, thus requiring additional bone to be harvested from other sites, or the use of bone graft substitutes (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2006</LINK>). Also, since harvesting bone creates a second surgical site, the use of autogenous bone increases operative time and blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Arrington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrington 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2002</LINK>). Morbidity at the donor site has been reported to be common and enduring (<LINK REF="REF-Goulet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulet 1997</LINK>). The most common morbidities are patient donor site pain and dissatisfaction with donor site appearance (<LINK REF="REF-Goulet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2001</LINK>). The rates and degrees of donor site pain vary, with 18-31% of patients still experiencing donor site pain 24 months postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Goulet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sasso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasso 2005</LINK>). Complications associated with AICBG include, but are not limited to; donor defect hernias, vascular injuries, nerve injuries, deep infection hematoma, iliac wing fracture, chronic pain limiting activity, superficial infection, superficial seromas, minor hematomas, dysesthesia and scar unsightliness (<LINK REF="REF-Arrington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrington 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Banwart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banwart 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allograft bone (bone harvested from another person) is sometimes used as an alternative to AICBG. Allograft bone has osteoconductive and weak osteoinductive properties. Its level of osteoinductivity depends on its preparation method. However, use of allograft bone is associated with an increased rate of infection, greater resorption rate, varying levels of immune response and longer fusion times compared with autograft bone (<LINK REF="REF-Vaccaro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccaro 2002</LINK>). Use of demineralised bone matrix (DBM) is a further alternative to use of iliac crest bone as DBM is made from allograft bone and is a composite of collagen, noncollagenous proteins and growth factors. However, due to its extensive processing, it is the least immunogenic of the types of allograft bone (<LINK REF="REF-Vaccaro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccaro 2002</LINK>). The morbidities associated with these alternative interventions, and the limited supply of iliac crest bone, have led to the development of bone graft substitutes.</P>
<P>BMPs induce bone through two pathways. They recruit mesenchymal cells from surrounding muscle, bone marrow or blood vessels and either differentiate these cells into osteoblasts to make bone directly or via cartilage cells which subsequently change into bone cells. BMPs also help in bone matrix production and vascularisation. In vivo, multiple BMPs are expressed during bone healing (<LINK REF="REF-Samartzis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samartzis 2005</LINK>). BMPs in nonunion fractures are applied to stimulate healing where it has not previously been successful, whereas in acute fractures, BMPs are used to accelerate fracture healing and reduce the frequency of secondary interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Termaat-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Termaat 2005</LINK>). BMP is isolated from bovine bone where complementary DNA encoding human BMP sequences are cloned and expressed in mammalian cells to yield large quantities of highly purified recombinant human BMP. In the operating theatre the BMP-2 is mixed and added to the carrier collagen sponge, and BMP-7 to the carrier collagen granules; the process taking about 15 minutes.</P>
<P>From an economic perspective, it is possible that a proportion or all of the direct medical costs of fracture treatment using BMP may be offset by reductions in the subsequent direct medical costs associated with complications and/ or secondary interventions and also by earlier return to productive activity. Use of BMP also has the potential to improve patients' health-related quality of life and function by avoiding donor site pain and dissatisfaction with donor site appearance associated with alternative treatments that involve bone grafts.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-05-15 08:21:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the prevalence of acute and nonunion fractures, it is important to establish the effectiveness associated with use of BMP as an adjunct to, or replacement for, current standard treatments. Given the economic impact of acute and nonunion fractures and their treatment, and the need for economic decisions on the added value of adopting BMP in clinical practice, it is also important to critically evaluate and summarise current evidence on the costs (resource use) and estimated cost-effectiveness associated with use of BMP as an adjunct to, or replacement for, current standard treatments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies  </HEADING>
<P>Three reviewers (KG, IS and FS) independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results for potentially eligible RCTs and economic evaluations. We also filtered the results of searches using specialised electronic search filters configured to identify potential economic evaluations (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2007</LINK>). We sought full text reports of potentially eligible studies, and where only abstracts were identified we attempted to contact lead authors. Disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved by discussion. Excluded studies were listed with reasons for exclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management  </HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted from included RCTs by one reviewer (KG) and checked by another (FS). The data extraction form for RCTs included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>General information: authors, source, title, publication status, year of publication, country, sponsoring and study objectives.</LI>
<LI>Participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria, total number and number in intervention groups, age, gender, weight, baseline comparability, drop-outs and reasons for drop-outs.</LI>
<LI>Trial characteristics: design, length of follow-up, randomisation (method), allocation concealment (method) and blinding of assessors.</LI>
<LI>Interventions: types, dose, carrier and surgical procedure.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: outcomes specified above.</LI>
<LI>Results: intention-to-treat analysis and outcome measures.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data were collected from included economic evaluations by one reviewer (IS) and checked by another (MM). The data extraction form for economic evaluations (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) was based on the format and guidelines used to produce structured abstracts of full economic evaluations for inclusion in the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2007</LINK>), adapted to reflect specific design features of this review. Economic evaluations were classified by type, using a classification scheme proposed by Drummond (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2005</LINK>) (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), and further classified as either an economic evaluation based on a single study or a model-based economic evaluation. Where necessary, additional information and/or unpublished data were sought from study authors. Secondary analyses of original data sets utilised in these two economic evaluations were conducted by one reviewer (IS).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>Risk of bias of each included trial, including one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>) providing clinical data utilised in three included economic evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>), was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Assessments were conducted by one reviewer (KG) and checked by another (FS). Risk of bias in the study (or studies) providing clinical data utilised in a fourth included economic evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) was assessed by one reviewer (IS), again using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. Items assessed were as the listed quality criteria in the protocol: adequate sequence generation; adequate randomisation concealment; blinding of assessors; comparability of baseline characteristics between groups; explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria; intention-to-treat analysis of at least the primary outcome; and adequate reporting of drop-outs.</P>
<P>Assessment of the overall methodological quality of included economic evaluations based on single, empirical studies was informed by application of a recognised checklist based on guidelines for authors and peer reviewers of economic submissions to the British Medical Journal (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 1996</LINK>) and against the risk of bias tool. Assessment of the overall methodological quality of model-based economic evaluations was informed by application of a recognised checklist for quality assessment in economic decision-analytic models (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2004</LINK>). Checklists were completed independently by two reviewers (IS and MM) and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Completed checklists for each included economic evaluation are included in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<P>Quantitative data (both dichotomous and continuous) reported in individual trials and economic evaluations are presented in the analyses and tables. Dichotomous data for union rate, secondary procedures and hardware failure are presented as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals in the analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>For studies with multiple treatment groups, each treatment group was compared separately to the control group where possible. Where this was not possible, the appropriateness of combining multiple treatment groups was assessed using subgroup analysis and, if necessary, inappropriate groups were excluded from analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues  </HEADING>
<P>Where there were multiple treatment groups in one study, the control group was proportionately split to each group and compared independently.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>When necessary, authors were contacted for missing data. Analysis of primary outcome (union rate) was assessed using intention-to-treat analysis with any drop-outs or missing patients treated as union failures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was inspected by use of forest plots, chi-squared tests (with P value &lt; 0.05 representing heterogeneity) and I² tests (30% to 60% is interpreted to represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% is interpreted to represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity). Where significant levels of statistical heterogeneity were identified, possible sources were explored using a sensitivity analysis which excluded various trials from the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>There were insufficient trials available to assess for possible publication bias via funnel plots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>Acute and nonunion fractures were assessed separately due to different healing characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Termaat-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Termaat 2005</LINK>). Data were summarised statistically where appropriate, subject to availability of data. For meta-analyses, risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes using the random-effects model. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mean differences with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed in the nonunion meta-analysis by exclusion of studies which included patients with bone defects and the meta-analysis of acute fracture secondary interventions (where <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002</LINK> was excluded as it did not report the number of drop-outs).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economics issues</HEADING>
<P>All elements of the economics components of this review were conducted according to current guidance on the use of economics methods in the preparation and maintenance of Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Shemilt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shemilt 2008</LINK>). Part of the rationale for presenting economics components of the review in fine detail, with comprehensive appendices, is to profile full implementation of current economics methods guidance, in order to provide a template for others to adapt to manage economics components of other new or updated Cochrane reviews. Therefore,  authors of other Cochrane reviews are not necessarily expected to implement the full range of economics methods used and presented in this review (and indeed, this may not be appropriate or feasible for some reviews).</P>
<P>Results of included economic evaluations are summarised in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, supplemented by a narrative summary in the main text. In <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> and in the narrative summary of results, all costs have been adjusted to 2008 International Dollar values using a web-based conversion tool that is based on implicit price deflators for GDP and Purchasing Power Parities for GDP (<LINK REF="REF-Shemilt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shemilt 2010</LINK>). All costs presented in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> are expressed in the currency and price year used in each included study. Users of this review wishing to adjust costs to another currency and price year should use costs presented in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and not those presented in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> or in the main text of this review. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of fracture severity on estimates of resource use, costs and cost-effectiveness.</P>

<P>Eleven RCTs involving 976 participants are included in this review. Two studies are published only as abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1997</LINK>) and one is a paper written in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) (data extracted by FS).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Economic evaluations</HEADING>
<P>Four economic evaluation studies are included in this review. Two studies are published as posters (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>), one is published as part of a UK Health Technology Assessment review (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) and one is published in German language (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK>) (translated into English language by VA). Two studies are full economic evaluations; one is a cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) and one is a cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>). Two studies are partial economic evaluations; both cost analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>). Three studies involve patients with acute open tibial fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>) and one study involves patients with nonunion tibial fractures (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>); fracture severity is not reported.</P>
<P>Three economic evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>) compare treatment with a 1.5 mg/ml dose of BMP-2 as an adjunct to intramedullary nail fixation (IM) with routine soft tissue management, versus IM with routine soft tissue management alone. All three studies utilise clinical data collected from the same RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>) to generate estimates of the impact of the compared treatments on resource use (i.e. resource use associated with complications of treatment and secondary/revision surgical procedures) and associated estimates of costs. Therefore, these three studies cannot be viewed as entirely independent of one another, nor of the results of Govender 2002. By extension, estimates of cost-effectiveness produced by the cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) are not independent of the results of Govender 2002. The other economic evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) includes three comparisons: BMP-7 (dosage not specified) as an adjunct to IM with routine soft tissue management compared with autograft as an adjunct to IM with routine soft tissue management (UK);  BMP-7 (dosage not specified) as an adjunct to IM with routine soft tissue management compared with Ilizarov fixation as an adjunct to IM with routine soft tissue management (UK); BMP-7 (dosage not specified) as an adjunct to IM compared with routine soft tissue management compared with fixation with a nail or plate and routine soft tissue management, with autograft when appropriate (Germany). The source(s) of the clinical data utilised in this study are unclear.</P>
<P>Two economic evaluations are based on single, empirical clinical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>).Two other economic evaluations are model-based economic evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>). Although the former involves patients with acute open tibial fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) whilst the latter involves patients with nonunion tibial fractures (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>), these two studies use essentially similar model structures (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), based on similar theories of the role of the intervention in addressing the medical condition under evaluation, leading to similar structural assumptions. Specifically, both studies use a simple decision tree structure to compare the costs and clinical consequences of experimental and comparator interventions, based on the theory that the interventions will have a differential impact on complications, secondary/ revisional procedures and the time to and/or rate of fracture healing, and therefore on associated direct medical costs. Differences in model structure between these two studies relate primarily to differences in their specification of complications parameters, choice of comparators and the point of intervention in the treatment pathway (i.e. treatment of acute fractures versus treatment of non-union fractures).</P>
<P>One economic evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK>) adopts the analytic perspective of a public health insurance company in Germany (third party payer) and reports results using 2005 German EUR (&#8364;) prices; one (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) adopts a UK health care system perspective and reports results using 2006 UK GBP (£) prices; one (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>) considers two analytic perspectives - a United States hospital (single provider) and a United States insurer (third-party payer) - and reports results using 2003 USD ($) prices; and one (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) considers a hospital (single provider) perspective in both the UK and Germany and reports results using 2001 UK GBP (£) or 2001 German EUR (&#8364;) prices. The time horizons of costs (and effects, if applicable) adopted in these four studies are one year (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>), two years (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>) and unclear (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>Although all studies stated they were randomised controlled trials, only <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK> reported the method of randomisation (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Based on the randomisation method using a central 24-hour automated system, the allocation method was deemed acceptable as well. None of the remaining studies reported the allocation method used. Five studies reported that they used at least one independent blinded assessor to read radiographs to determine fracture healing. Six trials did not report adequate details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria used to select patients. Three trials did not use the intention-to-treat principle to analyse the final data; however, for the majority of the trials it was unclear whether this principle was used. <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002</LINK> did not report the fracture healing rate.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluations</HEADING>
<P>Completed checklists for each included economic evaluation are included in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>The reliability of any full economic evaluation is in part predicated on its use of reliable clinical data, including data on beneficial and adverse effects, complications and secondary interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Shemilt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shemilt 2008</LINK>). Risk of bias in studies generating clinical data utilised in the two included full economic evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) was therefore assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. The model-based cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) utilises clinical data collected exclusively from <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. However, <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK> includes two BMP intervention groups, with patients receiving a 0.75 mg/mL or 1.5 mg/mL dose of BMP-2 respectively, and a control group receiving standard care, whilst the model-based cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) utilises effects data from the intervention group receiving a 1.5 mg/mL dose of BMP-2 and the control group only (i.e. it excludes the intervention group receiving a 0.75 mg/mL dose of BMP-2). This decision is attributable to the principal finding of <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>, which suggests that only use of a 1.5 mg/mL dose of BMP-2 (and not a 0.75 mg/mL dose) demonstrates clinical efficacy, compared with standard care. All aspects of risk of bias in the studies (or study) generating clinical data utilised in the model-based cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) are unclear, since the source(s) of these data are not reported; the authors state only that "Data on efficacy [of BMP-7] were obtained from clinical trials and literature".</P>
<P>The overall methodological quality of the two included partial economic evaluations, both cost-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>), is reasonable. However, neither cost analysis reports quantities of resource use separately from their unit costs, nor do they report measures of variance or 95% CIs for estimates of mean costs. In the cost analysis in <LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK>, these two methodological limitations are attributable to the authors' decision to use randomisation group-level data in their analysis to estimate mean cost differences between the intervention and control groups. Both of these limitations were overcome by conducting a secondary analysis of individual patient-level data obtained from <LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK> for this review (conducted by IS). Other limitations of the cost analysis reported by <LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK> are that: no sensitivity analysis is reported; calculation of direct medical costs does not include the costs of outpatient visits and physical therapy; the analysis assumes that the day of fracture healing corresponds to the day of resumption of work and that all patients were in paid employment before their fracture. Other limitations of the cost analysis reported by <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK> are that: a limited (univariate) sensitivity analysis, including only one variable (% of rhBMP-2 price reimbursed by payers), is reported; no discounting of costs is reported despite the study's two-year time horizon; the authors do not acknowledge or address potential variations in treatment costs between patients with acute open tibial fractures of different severities. Like the model-based cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>), both included cost analyses base their estimates of resource use on clinical data collected from the same, single multi-centre RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>), but utilise clinical data relating to the intervention group receiving a 1.5 mg/mL dose of BMP-2 and the control group only (i.e. they do not utilise clinical data relating to the intervention group receiving 0.75 mg/mL dose of BMP-2). This decision is again attributable to the principal finding of <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>, which suggests that only use of a 1.5 mg/mL dose of BMP-2 (and not a 0.75 mg/mL dose) demonstrates clinical efficacy, compared with standard care.</P>
<P>The overall methodological quality of the model-based cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) is good. However, several methodological limitations are worthy of note. First, the authors do not report quantities of resource use separately from their unit costs (quantities of resource use reported in this review are obtained from unpublished data supplied by the study authors). Second, the authors appear to have reported their results selectively in the original study report. Specifically, in the original study report, incremental cost per QALY is reported for all open fracture patients and for patients with Gustilo-Anderson grade III fractures (i.e. IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC combined), but not separately for patients with Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC fractures respectively, nor for patients with Gustilo-Anderson grade II fractures or patients with Gustilo-Anderson grade I fractures. The same selective reporting of results is found in the original study report with respect to direct medical costs. Third, as discussed by the authors, the analysis is limited by a lack of objective empirical data on health state utility values associated with open tibial fractures. Disutility values used in the analysis are extrapolated from estimates for older women with hip fractures and women with long-standing vertebral osteoporotic fractures. Whilst the authors attempt to overcome this limitation by assuming disutility values to be 30% smaller than those used in the original industry-sponsored model on which the study is based, they acknowledge this assumption to be arbitrary. Finally, it is debatable whether use of a time dependent model structure may capture differential utility gain more accurately than the decision tree model structure used in the analysis.</P>
<P>The overall methodological quality of the model-based cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) is difficult to assess, due to the lack of detail in the report. Several specific methodological and reporting limitations are worthy of note. Estimates of resource use used in the model are based on expert opinion, which may be considered a low quality source of evidence to inform resource use parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2005</LINK>). The report does not include any assessment of the quality of data identified for use in the economic model and data modelling methodology is not described in sufficient detail to allow judgement of whether the methods used are based on justifiable statistical and epidemiological techniques. The time horizon of the analysis is not reported. Measures of variance are not reported for mean resource use or cost values and 95% CIs are not reported with respect to estimates of cost-effectiveness. Incremental analysis is not reported with respect to costs or cost-effectiveness. The authors do not acknowledge or address potential variations in treatment costs and effects between patients with nonunion tibial fractures of different severities. Whilst the authors state that sensitivity analysis has been performed, with sensitive parameters reported, the methods and results of sensitivity analysis are not reported systematically. In particular it is unclear whether uncertainty is evaluated in all parameters, or in only a few key parameters, and what methods or assumptions are used to determine the ranges over which variables are tested. Finally, it is debatable whether an alternative Markov model structure could have been considered in preference to the decision tree model structure used, to enable modelling of cost-effectiveness over more than one treatment cycle.</P>
<P>Full model-based economic evaluations should ideally consider all feasible and practical treatment options that may be used in the study setting (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2004</LINK>). In principle it is feasible that other available BMP products could have been included as treatment options in the two model-based full economic evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the included economic studies requires assessment with vastly different parameters to effectiveness studies. However, the economic evaluations are included as primary studies and therefore appear in the Cochrane risk of bias analyses, but their inclusion in 'Risk of bias' tables is not appropriate due to their use of data from included RCTs. Therefore, this has affected the overall 'Risk of bias' figures (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Time to union</HEADING>
<P>Five RCTs report data for the time to healing (<LINK REF="STD-Calori-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Calori 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maniscalco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maniscalco 2002</LINK>). However, due to differences in reporting the results could not be pooled (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Apart from <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK>, the trials report comparable times to healing between the BMP and control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK> reports significantly faster healing in both control groups using external or internal fixation (P = 0.05 and P = 0.019 respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK> reports significantly faster healing in the 1.5 mg/mL BMP group (median 145 days) than in the control group (median 184 days).</P>
<P>The cost analysis conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK> utilises data on time to healing collected from <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. However, the median time to fracture healing in the control group reported in this cost analysis (197 days) is longer than the median time to fracture healing in the control group as reported in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK> (184 days). This apparent discrepancy is explained by the different purposes of these two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK> has a clinical focus and therefore aims to measure the biologic effect of BMP on time to fracture healing, thus excluding those patients who received a secondary intervention due to a technical failure of the implant. The <LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a</LINK> cost analysis has a health economics focus and therefore aims to measure the impact of time to fracture healing on productivity losses due to patients' time off work, thus including those patients regardless of whether or not they received a secondary intervention. The model-based cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>) also utilises data on time to healing as reported in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>, expressed in mean weeks. The cost-utility analysis reports faster healing time in the 1.5 mg/mL BMP group (mean 26.64 weeks) than in the control group (mean 31.99 weeks).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Union rate</HEADING>
<P>Seven of the 11 RCTs report a definition of successful fracture union, of which all include the parameter of bridging bone seen on a certain number of radiographic views (<LINK REF="STD-Cook-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friedlaender 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Geesink-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Geesink 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maniscalco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maniscalco 2002</LINK>). Three RCTs also include clinical outcomes in their definition of union (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maniscalco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maniscalco 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rate of fracture healing is reported by all RCTs apart from <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002</LINK> (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). RCTs were grouped as either acute or nonunion fractures for meta-analysis apart from <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK> which was considered to be neither and thus is analysed separately. The two studies with defects were included in the nonunion group (<LINK REF="STD-Calori-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Calori 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Geesink-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Geesink 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Applying the random-effects model, the risk ratio for achieving union without secondary procedure for acute fractures is 1.19 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.43) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Over half the weight comes from the <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. In this trial, the 0.75 mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL concentrations of BMP were each compared to half of the control group. The results suggest, but do not confirm a dose dependent effect. There is moderate heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 32%). In <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>, the 1.50 mg/mL BMP group has significantly more younger patients than both the 0.75 mg/mL and control groups, as well as significantly more patients who received reamed nailing (reamed nailing is where the inside of the bone is drilled out and then the nail inserted). Reamed bone produces bone 'dust', which is a form of bone graft, and may help healing (unreamed nails are just pushed into the bone) (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>For nonunions subsequent to long bone fractures, the pooled RR for attaining union is 1.02 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.15) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). There is moderate heterogeneity (I² = 39%). This heterogeneity persists on the exclusion of the study available only as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1997</LINK>); and for the two studies including patients with defects (<LINK REF="STD-Calori-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Calori 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geesink-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Geesink 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>For patients treated with corrective osteotomy for radial malunions, there was no significant difference in the union rate without secondary procedures between BMP and control groups, RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three economic evaluations including patients with acute open tibial fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2004</LINK>) utilise clinical data on union rate collected from <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. The source of clinical data on union rate utilised in the economic evaluation including patients with nonunion tibial fractures (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>) is unclear (this study reports a lower union rate amongst patients receiving BMP (81%) compared with patients receiving autograft (85%)).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Secondary procedures</HEADING>
<P>Fewer patients with acute fractures who received BMP underwent secondary procedures according to three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002</LINK>): RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.83) (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002</LINK> does not report the number of dropouts and therefore intention-to-treat data could not be calculated. Upon excluding this study from the analysis the result is still significant (P = 0.005). The different BMP dose groups were again separately compared to half of the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. Again, the results for the higher dose of 1.5 mg/mL were more favourable than those for the 0.75 mg/mL dose, but a test for interaction does not confirm this to be statistically significant.</P>
<P>Two studies in the prior nonunion group found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the number of secondary interventions (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.28) (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK> found no difference between the two groups in the number of participants requiring secondary procedure to attain union after corrective osteotomy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Infection</HEADING>
<P>Five RCTs report patients developing infections (<LINK REF="STD-Cook-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friedlaender 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>). Two BMP/autograft group patients and one control group patient developed deep infection requiring surgical intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1999,</LINK> one autograft patient developed an infection and failed to heal. Four patients in the external fixation group of the <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK> (three in autograft group and one in BMP-7 group) had superficial pin track infections which cleared with antibiotics. <LINK REF="STD-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friedlaender 2001</LINK> reported two patients who received OP-1 and 13 control patients with osteomyelitis of the lower leg, and 14 OP-1 and 12 control patients with postoperative infection. Twelve (15%) 0.75 mg/mL BMP-2, 15 (21%) 1.50 mg/mL BMP-2 and 13 (15%) of control patients with Gustilo-Anderson types I and II had fracture site infections in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. Also in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>, 19 (29%) 0.75 mg/mL BMP-2, 15 (24%) 1.50 mg/mL BMP-2 and 26 (44%) of control patients with Gustilo-Anderson types IIIA and IIIB had fracture site infection.</P>
<P>It was possible to collect data on numbers and rates of patients developing infections from two economic evaluations of acute fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Alt-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Alt 2006a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>). These data are reported in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> (and <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) but it should be noted they are derived from <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. Overall infection rates reported in these two economic evaluations are broadly comparable with those reported in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>. However, it is noted that the authors apply setting-specific classifications of infection severity in order to enable estimation of the costs of infections based on unit costs applicable to the respective study settings (i.e. setting-specific unit costs vary by infection severity - <I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Hardware failure</HEADING>
<P>Of the two acute tibia fractures studies that reported hardware failures, there were significantly fewer failures in the BMP groups than the controls (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96) (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>, two control patients required dynamization of the intramedullary nail due to screw breakage but went on to heal (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2006</LINK>). The main cause of hardware failure in <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK> was either screw breakage or bending. Notably, there were significantly fewer failures in the 1.5 mg/mL BMP-2 group (16/145) versus the control group (32/147), P = 0.02. In <LINK REF="STD-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friedlaender 2001</LINK>, 25/61 BMP-7 patients and 34/61 autograft patients are reported to have had a 'mechanical complication of the internal orthopaedic device' (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>); however, details of the complications are not given. In <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK>, 10 of the 20 patients receiving internal fixation with a dorsal pi-plate experienced plate irritation, requiring surgery and plate removal in three BMP-7 patients and seven bone graft patients.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK> cost-effectiveness analysis, rates of hardware events are reported as 41% in the BMP-7 treatment group, 56% in the autograft group and 20% in the Ilizarov fixation group. However, the source(s) of these data are not reported.</P>

A secondary analysis of individual patient-level data collected from this study (conducted by IS) indicates that, on average (mean), patients receiving BMP-2 incur 32.4 fewer days off work compared with patients receiving current standard treatment (mean -32.4 days per patient (favours intervention), SD = 101.5, 95% CI -55.8 to -8.9). The difference in time off work between BMP and control patients is largest amongst patients with the most severe (Gustilo-Anderson grade III B) open tibial fractures (mean -44.9 days per patient (favours intervention), SD = 101.5, 95% CI -81.1 to -8.7), and in general this difference decreases as fracture severity decreases (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:15:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>In this review, we have systematically reviewed the available evidence from both randomised controlled trials and economic evaluations evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) for treating acute fractures or fracture nonunion. </P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-12 09:53:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Eleven randomised controlled trials, involving 976 participants, and four economic evaluations, three of which focused on the same trial, are included. Most trials were sponsored and funded by industry.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>Four RCTs involved patients with acute tibial fractures, of which the two larger RCTs included patients with open tibial fractures fixed using intramedullary nailing (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-McKee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 2002</LINK>). Four RCTs included patients with tibial fracture nonunions, two trials included patients with critically sized defects, one of which also included long-bone nonunion. The remaining small study included patients who had undergone corrective osteotomy for symptomatic radial malunion (<LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from <LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK>, the times to fracture healing were comparable between the BMP and control groups. There are very limited data on the effectiveness of BMP in closed acute fractures. </P>
<P>There is some evidence for increased healing rates, without requiring a secondary procedure, of BMP compared with usual care control in acute, mainly open, tibial fractures (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.43). Most of the evidence was from one large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>), of 450 participants, which found increased healing rates of a higher dose of 1.5 mg/mL BMP-2 compared with a 0.75 mg/mL dose. However, this trial had important confounding resulting from the imbalance in the age of participants (these were younger in the two BMP groups) and that significantly more patients received reamed intramedullary nailing in the higher dose group. To a lesser extent these reservations apply to the favourable findings for secondary procedures for attaining union. Data from three trials showed that fewer secondary procedures were required for acute fracture patients treated with BMP versus controls (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of benefit for BMP, compared usually with bone grafts, for achieving union for fracture nonunion (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15). This was, however, a heterogenous group of small trials. Notably, although BMP has an angiogenic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Vaccaro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccaro 2002</LINK>), selection bias may lead to an apparent lack of effectiveness if a study group includes greater numbers of atrophic nonunions than the control group. This was the case for the largest trial in this group (<LINK REF="STD-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friedlaender 2001</LINK>). Data from two trials in the prior nonunion group found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the number of secondary interventions (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.28).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ekrol-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ekrol 2008</LINK> found no difference in union for patients who had corrective osteotomy for radial malunions, but found that the control group healed significantly faster than the BMP group. The authors abandoned use of non-bridging external fixation when half of the BMP patients experienced osteolysis. Subsequently, the use internal fixation did not lead to any cases of osteolysis, suggesting the inability of the BMP application to provide structural support to the site.</P>
<P>Reported adverse events were infection, hardware failure, pain, donor site pain/complications, heterotopic bone formation and immunogenic reactions. Of the two acute tibia fractures studies reporting hardware failures, there were significantly fewer failures in the BMP groups than the controls (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96). The development of ectopic bone was reported in two studies. No further surgery was performed, but the cause and potential implications should be further investigated. The presence of ectopic bone, if excessive, may interfere with limb function and there is concern that the natural osteoblastic control mechanism may be affected by exogenous supra-physiological doses of BMP. The limited data on donor site problems were mainly on donor site pain. While we found no evidence to suggest treatment with BMP is more effective for patients with nonunions compared with control treatment; it does, however, eliminate the need for bone grafting and thus avoid donor site morbidity. When patients with critically sized defects of the fibula were treated with BMP-7, investigators report bone induction with no adverse events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluations</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from economic evaluations of BMP-2 for acute open tibial fractures is limited by the reliance of all the studies on the same source of clinical data collected from one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>), which means their results are not independent, and also by the methodological limitations of individual studies. Taking these important limitations into account, there is evidence that direct medical costs associated with treatment with the 1.5 mg/mL dose of BMP-2 are likely to exceed those associated with current standard treatments but the magnitude of this cost difference is likely to decrease as fracture severity increases. Observed between-study variations in the magnitude of direct medical cost differences between treatment groups are likely to reflect variations in local prices and in the apportionment of costs, as well as other features of local context including clinical practice, organisation and delivery of care and economies of scale. There is also limited evidence to indicate that a proportion of direct medical costs may be offset by reduced productivity costs associated with faster healing and reduced time off work. Amongst employed patients with the most severe open tibial fractures, the value of reduced productivity costs could exceed the value of direct medical costs, leading to overall cost savings. The latter findings may be of particular interest to third party payers, employers and/or patients who incur financial costs associated with patients' absence from work.</P>
<P>Only one full economic evaluation of BMP treatment for acute open tibial fractures is currently available; a cost-utility analysis conducted from a UK health care system perspective (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>). The overall methodological quality of this study is good. Its results support the view that BMP-2 treatment is more likely to be considered economically attractive, compared to current standard treatments, when used to treat patients with the most severe acute open tibial fractures (Gustilo-Anderson grades IIIB and IIIC). Unpublished data from the study also provides some evidence that BMP-2 treatment may be less likely to be considered economically attractive when used to treat less severe acute open tibial fractures (Gustilo-Anderson grades I, II and IIIA). Placed in the context of evidence from all currently available economic evaluations, this study also suggests that BMP-2 treatment may be more likely to be judged economically attractive when its impact on patients' quality of life is considered alongside other treatment effects and costs.</P>
<P>Evidence from one economic evaluation of BMP treatment for nonunion tibial fractures is limited due to the lack of detail in the published report and methodological limitations, including reliance on resource use data sourced using expert opinion (<LINK REF="STD-van-Engen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Engen 2003</LINK>). The authors of this study concluded that cost-effectiveness ratios associated with three treatment opinions (BMP-7, autograft and Ilizarov fixation) were comparable in the UK but favoured usual care (fixation with a nail or plate, with autograft when appropriate) over BMP-7 in Germany.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:05:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The clinical effectiveness of BMP treatment in acute fractures and nonunions is only partially shown. As shown in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>, further evidence to inform the use of BMP for fracture healing is pending and will be included in future updates of this review. This includes a trial comparing 1.5 mg/mL rhBMP-2 versus usual care for 277 patients with open tibial fractures treated with reamed intramedullary nailing (<LINK REF="STD-Aro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aro 2010</LINK>). The use of reaming for all nails in this trial will counter one of the key concerns regarding <LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>The included studies involved patients with varying diagnoses, including acute tibial fractures, tibial nonunions, critically sized defects and radial malunions. Patients underwent varying surgical treatments and received different forms of BMP (mainly BMP-7). Most studies reported outcomes of interest, however the comprehensiveness and comparability of reported outcomes was often broad. The definitions of successful healing varied widely between the studies, therefore what one assessor may consider healed may not apply clinically. The different clinical outcomes reported prevented pooling (for example, different function scores assessed). No studies reported outcomes related to donor site appearance and there were limited data on donor site pain. Donor site morbidity is one of the main adverse events associated with autograft and needs to be taken into account when determining the appropriate use of BMP. Results may not be directly applicable to patients with any serious co-morbidities as any of studies which included them were excluded.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:05:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The overall quality of included RCTs is poor. Most have small sample sizes and less than half reported methods of randomisation and allocation. Some failed to use independent blinded assessors or to perform intention-to-treat analysis. The largest RCT involving patients with acute fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>) included only patients with diaphyseal open fractures and therefore the results may not be applicable to patients with metaphyseal tibial fractures. Two of the acute fracture RCTs were funded by industry (Wyeth Research/Genetic Institute and Stryker Biotech Inc) and several authors were listed as salaried employees of the company when these studies were conducted. Reports suggest industry-sponsored trials are more likely to report results favouring the industry's product (<LINK REF="REF-Friedlaender-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedlaender 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessing fracture healing radiographically is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Friedlaender-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedlaender 2001</LINK>). Assessors must decide how many cortices must be bridged for union to be considered healed.  This varies from bridging callus in at least one cortex in each plane to three or four cortices. When autograft bone is used, the assessor must distinguish the implanted autograft bone from the new bone. The subjectivity inherent in this process was reflected in the various definitions of union success used in the studies. In clinical practice, union is defined by combined clinical and radiographic findings. Therefore, studies relying on radiographic evidence alone are less applicable to clinical practice. Fracture healing is a continuous process and the quality (strength or stiffness) of any bridging callus cannot be defined on a radiograph. Most surgeons prefer an end point measure of healing based on both clinical and radiographic findings. This means the critical end point is subjective and not easily quantifiable. The definition of fracture healing is therefore open to bias, emphasizing the importance of independent, blinded assessors.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:15:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The review was conducted following criteria in the published protocol. Comprehensive searches were carried out to identify relevant studies. We tried to contact authors of studies with missing data with limited response. Two of the included studies are only available as abstracts, thus limiting the data available. This review, including data collection and analysis, was conducted independently of industry.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:15:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Our findings for nonunion were similar to that by the Agency for Healthcare and Quality in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Schoelles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoelles 2005</LINK>), which concluded that an analysis was needed to show that BMP (along with internal fixation) was not inferior to autogenous bone graft and that additional studies were needed to replicate the results. Trials that aim to show the experimental treatment is at least as efficacious as a control treatment are termed &#8220;non-inferiority trials&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Henanff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Henanff 2006</LINK>). It is not necessary for BMP to be superior to autologous bone graft, only that it has an equivalent effect and therefore can be used as a safe alternative. However, the available evidence is limited and clinically important differences between the use of BMP and autologous bone graft cannot be persuasively ruled out.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-05-10 15:37:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>This review highlights the paucity of data on the use of BMP in fracture healing as well as heavy industry involvement in currently available RCTs and economic evaluations. Current evidence is mainly limited to the use of BMP for tibial fracture and nonunion. Data from trials on acute open tibial fractures suggest that BMP may be more effective than controls, usually surgery alone, for fracture healing and for avoiding the need for secondary procedures to attain union. This evidence, however, was dominated by one large trial, which was compromised by an imbalance in the use of reaming for intermedullary nailing that could have contributed to the favourable findings for BMP. The use of BMP for treating tibial fracture nonunions remains unclear. Economic evidence is currently limited with respect to both acute fractures and nonunions, but the available evidence indicates that BMP treatment for acute open tibial fractures may be more likely to be judged favourably, from an economic perspective, when its use is restricted to patients with the most severe fractures and where decision-makers need to consider the impacts of alternative treatments on patients' productivity and/or health-related quality of life. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-04 12:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Further well-designed RCTs and economic evaluations are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BMP for acute fractures of the tibia and, in particular, tibial non-unions. Further investigation is also required to investigate clinical differences between BMP-2 and BMP-7, their relative effectiveness, and whether effectiveness is enhanced if their use is combined. Future economic evaluations of BMP should pay particular attention to potential variations in incremental costs and cost-effectiveness between patients with fractures of different grades of severity and should also consider the impact of alternative treatments on patients' health-related quality of life. To inform the latter, studies are needed to establish objective data on patient utility in patient populations with the types of fractures being evaluated. Depending on the primary desision-maker, future economic evaluations should also consider the impact of alternative treatments on productivity costs and take into account all relevant treatment options. Finally, well-designed RCTs and economic evaluations of BMP for treating fracture locations other than the tibia are also needed.</P>

<P>To demonstrate the safety of administering rhBMP-2/CPM (either 1mg/ml or 2mg/ml) as an adjunct to internal fixation in subjects with fractures of the proximal femur. The key safety outcome is the incidence of secondary fracture displacement among subjects treated with rh-BMP-2/CPM and those receiving standard surgical treatment (internal fixation) alone. To establish a satisfactory method of administering rhBMP-2/CPM to implement in a phase 3 efficacy trial in this clinical indication. To estimate the success and failure rates associated with key fracture outcomes.</P>

<P>The objective of the study is to compare the costs associated with use of rhBMP-2 as an adjunct to IM with routine soft-tissue management, versus the costs associated with the current standard surgical treatment of open tibial shaft fractures: use of IM with routine soft tissue management alone. The authors hypothesise potential cost savings resulting from the adjunctive use of rhBMP-2, due to faster fracture healing and reduced revision and infection rates.</P>

<P>The authors&#8217; main conclusions are that &#8220;This work shows that net savings can be achieved for Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIB and [Gustilo-Anderson grade III B and IIIA] fractures by the use of rhBMP-2 from the perspective of German public health insurer&#8221; and that &#8220;the main driver for the savings is avoided sickness payments due to faster fracture healing by rhBMP-2&#8221;. </P>

<P>Commentary</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>
<I>Choice of comparator:</I>
</P>
<P>Although no explicit justification was provided for the comparator used, the comparator appears to represent standard practice in the authors&#8217; setting in 2005. End-users of this Cochrane review should decide if the comparator represents current practice in their own setting.</P>
<P>
<I>Modelling:</I>
</P>
<P>Not applicable no formal model is used.</P>
<P>
<I>Validity of estimate of costs:</I>
</P>
<P>The analysis of costs was performed from the perspective of the insurer (third-party payer). It appears that, given the perspective adopted, most relevant categories of costs (resource use) have been included in the analysis. Exceptions (not considered) are the costs of outpatient visits and physical therapy. As the analysis did not include these costs, it is possible that the reported cost savings associated with the clinical benefits accruing from the use of rhBMP-2 are underestimated from an insurers (third-party payer) perspective. </P>
<P>*It is also important to highlight that in the original study, analysis of costs does not utilise individual-level resource use or cost data directly. This leads to limitations in the reporting of estimates of costs; specifically that measures of variance are not reported for mean values. A further limitation of the original study is that measures of resource use were not reported separately from their unit costs.</P>
<P>
<I>Other issues:</I>
</P>
<P>The authors do not compare the principal findings of their study with those from other studies.</P>
<P>*The authors do not appear to have reported results selectively. Although their original analysis was based on a sub-group of the intention-to-treat population within the trial utilised as the source of resource use data (<LINK REF="STD-Govender-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Govender 2002</LINK>), this decision may be attributable to the clinical results of the source trial, which indicate that only the 1.5 mg/mL concentration of rhBMP-2 and not the 0.75 mg/mL concentration demonstrate clinical efficacy compared to standard care.</P>
<P>In general, the authors&#8217; conclusions appear to follow from the data reported in the original study. However, the original study (and the secondary analysis conducted by IS) indicates that incremental one-year direct medical costs in the BMP-2 group are not offset by cost savings from reduced one-year sickness payments amongst patients with less severe fracture types, and this conclusion is not reported in the original study.</P>
<P>The numbers of patients by fracture severity within the individual patient-level data set used in this cost analysis appear to differ from the numbers of patients by fracture severity reported in the BESST study, with respect to Gustilo-Anderson IIIB (intervention only) and Gustilo-Anderson II and I (intervention and control).  How is this explained? </P>
<P>The authors discuss the following limitations of their study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The assumption that the day of fracture healing corresponds to the day of resumption of work and also that all patients worked before the accident and had public health insurance.</LI>
<LI>Non-inclusion of the costs of outpatient patient visits and the costs of physical therapy</LI>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The principal measure of health benefits used in the cost-utility analysis is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</P>
<P>Utilities (disutility values due to fracture nonunion) are extrapolated from estimates for older women with hip fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Salkeld-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salkeld 2000</LINK>) and women with long-standing vertebral osteoporotic fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study authors state that &#8220;Salkeld and colleagues used the time trade-off technique to estimate the utility associated with hip fracture and fear of falling among older women (aged &#8807; 75 years). The baseline utility value (EQ-50) was 0.77 for interviewed women.</P>
<P>They found that a &#8216;bad&#8217; hip fracture (which results in admission to a nursing home) was valued at 0.05 and a &#8216;good&#8217; hip fracture (maintaining independent living in the community) 0.31. The disutility value for a &#8216;good&#8217; hip fracture could be estimated as 0.46 (0.77-0.31), on which it seems that the disutility value used for Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIB/C open tibial fracture nonunion in the original ABACUS model was based. Hall and colleagues measured QoL in women with long-standing vertebral osteoporotic fracture and age-matched normal women, using the SF-36. Then SF-36 scores were transformed to a utility score by the Fryback technique. It was found that the utility score was 0.64 for women with vertebral fracture and 0.72 for controls. The difference in the utility scores between the two groups is 0.08 (0.72-0.64). However, it is not clear how this estimate has been used to estimate disutility values in the ABACUS model. It is highly questionable whether the results from Salkeld and colleagues&#8217; study of hip fracture and Hall and colleagues&#8217; study of vertebral osteoporotic fracture are generalisable to patients with OTF. We identified a further study of economic evaluation of patients with closed tibial shaft fractures (New Reference). Based on expert opinion, the utility value estimated was 0.9 for returning to normal activities, 0.5 for nonunion, 0.6 for delayed union and 0.5 for experiencing a postoperative complication. This study estimated the utility value based on expert opinion, which was subjective and may not truly reflect patient opinion. Fracture union in the BESTT trial was defined by a combination of pain-free weight bearing and lack of tenderness at fracture site plus radiological union (three out of four cortices with bridging callus). Hence the QoL of patients may not be much different from normal many weeks before the defined fracture union. For example, a patient with pain-free weight bearing and lack of tenderness at the fracture site did not meet the criteria for fracture union if radiological union was not achieved. Therefore, the original ABACUS model may has overestimated the disutility values due to delayed union.&#8221;</P>
<P>In the revised model (<LINK REF="STD-Garrison-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garrison 2007</LINK>), based on the authors&#8217; assumption that disutility values are likely to be overestimated in the original ABACUS model, and in the absence of alternative objective data, disutility values are arbitrarily assumed be 30% smaller than those used in the original ABACUS model (i.e. a more conservative assumption).</P>
<P>The quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by the use of BMP are estimated based on the number of open tibial fracture patients, the additional well-patient weeks gained per intervention group patient (<I>see</I> table below) and assumed disutility values.</P>

<P>The authors perform probabilistic sensitivity analysis to investigate parameter uncertainty. Uncertainty is evaluated in all key cost and effectiveness parameters. Ranges over which variables were tested are determined based on the authors&#8217; own assumptions. Specifically, probabilistic simulations (10,000 Monte Carlo simulations) are generated using a range of input values 50% greater or smaller than the point estimates. Therefore, the variance of the point estimate (mean) of direct medical costs per patient, and the distances between the lower limit of the 95% CI and the mean, and between the mean and the upper limit of the 95% CI, are in part determined by these assumptions.</P>

<P>The authors state of the sensitivity analysis that: &#8220;There is a 35.5% probability that the cost per QALY gained by the use of BMP for [all] open tibial fractures is less than £30,000. The ICER is highly sensitive to the price of rhBMP-2.

<P>A secondary sensitivity analysis was conducted for the current Cochrane review using the revised model supplied by the authors**. This shows that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is 98.6% probability that the cost per QALY gained by the use of BMP for Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIC open tibial fractures is less than £30,000</LI>
<LI>There is 99.5% probability that the cost per QALY gained by the use of BMP for Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIB open tibial fractures is less than £30,000.</LI>

<P>
<I>Choice of comparator:</I>
</P>
<P>Although no explicit justification is provided for the comparator used, it would appear to represent standard practice in the authors&#8217; setting in 2006/07. End-users of this review should decide if the comparator represents current practice in their own setting.</P>
<P>
<I>Modelling:</I>
</P>
<P>The structure of the model, including a graphical representation and modelling assumptions is reported. Data sources for all parameters are reported in full. *Although not reported, additional information obtained from the authors indicates the time horizon of the model (costs and effects) is one year (Song, personal communication). The authors investigate uncertainty using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Sensitive parameters are reported. Uncertainty is evaluated in all key cost and effectiveness parameters.<I> </I>Structural uncertainty is not assessed.</P>
<P>
<I>Validity of estimate of costs:</I>
</P>
<P>Costs are assessed from the perspective of the UK healthcare system. It appears that, given the perspective adopted, all relevant categories of costs (resource use) are included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Quantities of resource use are not reported separately from aggregated cost data in the original study. Details of quantities of resource use reported above are extracted from unpublished data provided by the study authors. Unit cost data are reported in full in the original study, separately from aggregated cost data.</P>
<P>
<I>Other issues:</I>
</P>
<P>The authors do not compare the principal findings of their study with those from other studies.</P>
<P>The authors&#8217; conclusions appear to follow from the data reported in the original study.</P>
<P>The authors may have presented their results selectively in the original study. In the original study, incremental average (mean) cost per QALY is reported for all open fractures and for Gustilo-Anderson grade III fractures (i.e. IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC combined), but not for Gustilo-Anderson grades IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC fractures separately, nor for Gustilo-Anderson II or grade I fractures. The same is true with respect to average (mean) direct medical costs per patient. </P>
<P>The authors discuss one limitation of the study: that there is currently a lack of objective data on utility (disutility) values associated with open tibial fractures. Whilst the authors attempt to deal with this by assuming more conservative utility values in the revised model compared to those used in the original industry-sponsored model (which were based on values associated with hip fracture and fear of falling among older women and values associated with long-standing vertebral osteoporotic fracture in women), the revised assumption is acknowledged by the authors to be arbitrary.</P>

</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The authors conclude that: &#8220;The clinical benefits of rhBMP-2 translate into substantial reductions in medical resource utilization and costs over a 2-year time horizon. From a payer's perspective, if hospitals are reimbursed for half the cost of rhBMP-2, then the entire rhBMP-2 cost will be offset because of fewer downstream clinical events such as SI and infections. For hospitals, lack of rhBMP-2 reimbursement by payers results in limited cost offsets. When payers' rhBMP-2 reimbursement policies are more generous (e.g. reimbursement 50% of the rhBMP-2 cost), considerable cost offsets are achieved by both payers and hospitals.  Patients, physicians, payers, and hospitals should consider both the clinical and economic benefits of use of rhBMP-2 associated with avoiding delayed union or nonunion, infections, and SI. This economic analysis suggests that rhBMP-2 reimbursement policy is important in determining the economic value of rhBMP-2 from the payer and hospital perspectives. Favourable economic results can be achieved for both stake-holders with partial or full reimbursement of the rhBMP-2 cost.&#8221;</P>

<P>Commentary</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>
<I>Choice of comparator:</I>
</P>
<P>Although no explicit justification is provided for the comparator used, it would appear to represent standard practice in the authors&#8217; setting in 2003. End-users of this review should decide if the comparator represents current practice in their own setting.</P>
<P>
<I>Modelling:</I>
</P>
<P>Not applicable study does not use a formal economic model.</P>
<P>
<I>Validity of estimate of costs:</I>
</P>
<P>The analysis of costs is performed from two perspectives: those of the single provider (hospital) and the insurer (third-party payer). It appears that, given the perspectives adopted, most relevant categories of costs (resource use) are included in the analysis. As the analysis does not include costs borne by employers, the patient and their families (e.g. productivity costs, costs of informal care, other out-of-pocket expenses), it is likely that the reported cost savings associated with the clinical benefits accruing from the use of BMP-2 are underestimated, from a societal perspective.</P>
<P>Limitations of reporting estimates of costs are that measures of resource use are not reported separately from their unit costs and measures of variance (e.g. standard deviations, standard errors) are not reported for mean values.</P>
<P>
<I>Other issues:</I>
</P>
<P>The authors do not compare their findings with those from other studies. The authors do not acknowledge or address the issue of potential variations in treatment costs between patients with tibial shaft fractures of different severities.</P>
<P>The authors do not appear to have reported results selectively. Although this cost analysis is based on a sub-group of the intention-to-treat population within the trial utilised as the source of resource use data, this decision may be attributable to the clinical results of the source trial, which indicate that only the 1.5 mg/mL concentration of rhBMP-2 and not the 0.75 mg/mL concentration demonstrate clinical efficacy compared to standard care.</P>
<P>In general, the authors&#8217; conclusions appear to follow from the data reported. The authors state that &#8220;from a payer's perspective, if hospitals are reimbursed for half the cost of rhBMP-2, then the entire rhBMP-2 cost will be offset because of fewer downstream clinical events such as SI and infections&#8221;. This statement is reasonable based on the data reported. </P>
<P>However, an alternative but equally reasonable conclusion would have been that from a third-party payer perspective (and taking into account cost offsets associated with fewer downstream clinical events), the entire up-front cost of rhBMP-2 ($4,900) is offset if hospitals are reimbursed at a rate of 29%, and also that from a single provider (hospital) perspective, (again, taking into account cost offsets associated with fewer downstream clinical events), 9% of the up-front cost of rhBMP-2 is offset if hospitals are reimbursed at a rate of 100%.</P>
<P>Only a very limited sensitivity analysis is reported, so it is not clear how much confidence we can have in the study conclusions.</P>
<P>The authors do not discuss any limitations of their study.</P>

For all resources, 2001 reimbursement rules were applied according to the tariff lists: lists of prices of drugs, consultations, procedures and hospitalisation. In the UK, the unit costs for medications were obtained from the British National Formulary. Procedures, hospitalisations, and consultations were valued, wherever possible, according to the costs reported in the &#8220;Unit Costs of Health and Social Care&#8221; published by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) at the University of Kent. For the hospitalisation costs, costs per day are reported in the PSSRU. For Germany, the unit costs for medications were obtained from the Rote Liste. Procedures and consultations were valued, wherever possible, according to official Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab (EBM) tariffs published by the Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV).

<P>Resource use data: The authors state that: &#8220;Estimates for health care utilisation for treatment of the tibial nonunion were derived from country-specific expert panels using a modified Delphi method. A panel consisting of seven practising orthopaedic surgeons from the UK and 7 traumatologists from Germany were interviewed. These were one-on-one interviews performed by telephone. Disease specific questionnaires were developed to capture health resource utilisation with the use of sample patient profiles representing cases along the alternative clinical pathways of the model.&#8221;</P>
<P>Unit cost data: the authors state that: &#8220;Cost estimates for direct medical care were based on estimating the units of health care utilisation and their respective costs (using the sources described in &#8216;Data Sources&#8217;, above). As such, instead of a single overall charge billed for total health care resource use, individual items of medical resource utilisation are costed, and the net cost is the aggregate of all costed items.&#8221; The study reports principal cost and utilisation parameters underlying the model in full.</P>

<P>
<I>Choice of comparator</I>:</P>
<P>Although no explicit justification is provided for the comparator used, it would appear to represent standard practice in the authors&#8217; setting in 2005. End-users of this review should decide if the comparator represents current practice in their own setting.</P>
<P>
<I>Modelling:</I>
</P>
<P>The structure of the model, including a graphical representation, and modelling assumptions, are in general well reported. Data sources for resource use parameters and costs are reported in full. However, the time horizon of the model and the data sources for clinical evidence parameters are not reported.  The authors investigate uncertainty in the model parameters using a univariate sensitivity analysis. Sensitive parameters are reported, but the methods and results of the sensitivity analysis are not reported systematically. In particular it is unclear whether uncertainty has been evaluated in all parameters or in only a few key parameters; what methods or rationale have been used to determine the ranges over which variables were tested; and whether structural uncertainty is investigated and, if so, how different structures are tested in the model?</P>
<P>
<I>Validity of estimate of costs:</I>
</P>
<P>The analysis of costs is performed from the perspective of a hospital (single provider). It appears that, given the perspective adopted, most relevant categories of costs (resource use) have been included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Limitations in the reporting of estimates of costs are that measures of variance (e.g. standard errors) are not reported for mean values.</P>
<P>
<I>Other issues:</I>
</P>
<P>The authors did not compare the principal findings of their study with those from other studies.</P>
<P>In general, the authors&#8217; conclusions appear to follow from the data reported.</P>
<P>The authors do not appear to have presented their results selectively, although they do not always report results from any statistical tests performed.</P>
<P/>
<P>The authors discuss the limitations of the study as follows:</P>
<P>&#8220;Some of the limitations of this study are worth noting. The first one is typical to decision tree models, which usually do not allow for statistical testing of the differences between comparators. We have tried to address this weakness by using sufficiently wide ranges of values when doing sensitivity analysis. The second one is the use of assumptions in the model. While these assumptions are needed because we could not obtain some of the input data to the model, some of the assumptions may have significant influence to the model results. To fully assess such influences, we have done extensive sensitivity analysis on these assumptions we considered influential to the results. The third limitation pertains to the use of input data from a panel of experts. While this is considered the best and standard means to obtain the best possible estimates in the absence of input data, expert opinions are still subjective and the variation could be large.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;Open tibia fractures are still related to a high complication rate. Posttraumatic infections, delayed fracture healing and non-unions leading to revision&#8230;have a tremendous socio-economic impact&#8230; The additional use of rhBMP-2 in open tibia fractures is not related to additional payments for the hospital in the recent German DRG system. Only a limited number of hospitals can achieve individual agreements with health insurance companies for additional payment for rhBMP-2 according to&#8230;German Hospital Reimbursement regulations. Moreover, each hospital can apply and negotiate for additional reimbursement for rhBMP-2 for individual cases with health care insurance companies. Due to the significant price of the growth factor reimbursement is in most cases denied by the payers. Health economic data from the US on the use of rhBMP-2 in anterior lumbar spine fusion in which the growth factor can replace autogenous bone grafting from the iliac crest of the patient focus on the economic impact of rhBMP-2 from a hospital perspective. In this case, the economic benefit of rhBMP-2 is seen in the avoidance of costs related to the replacement of the autogenous bone grafting procedure with shorter OR time and reduced OR material use.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;As the health insurance companies are the theoretical payers for additional reimbursement of rhBMP-2 only costs were considered that have to be covered by health insurance companies. This enables a direct comparison between the upfront price of rhBMP-2 and potential cost savings that can be achieved by this treatment from the perspective of a public German health insurance company.&#8221;</P>

Two different rhBMP-2 concentrations were tested and only the 1.5 mg/ml concentration exhibited statistically significant differences compared to standard of care treatment. Therefore, only the data of the 1.5 mg/ml group were used in the current heath economic evaluation.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;From a payer's perspective, if hospitals are reimbursed for half the cost of rhBMP-2, then the entire rhBMP-2 cost will be offset because of fewer downstream clinical events such as SI and infections. For hospitals, lack of rhBMP-2 reimbursement by payers results in limited cost offsets. When payers' rhBMP-2 reimbursement policies are more generous (e.g. reimbursement 50% of the rhBMP-2 cost), considerable cost offsets are achieved by both payers and hospitals.&#8221;</P>

In probabilistic simulations, the range (95% CIs) of input parameters are 50% smaller or greater than the point estimates. Then input values were randomly sampled from a gamma or beta distribution to obtain random estimates for cost-effectiveness outcomes. The random simulations were repeated many times to generate a large number of random estimates, and the simulation results were used to calculate average estimates and corresponding CIs. For estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) can be created using the results of simulations.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;To test the stability of the model&#8217;s results, sensitivity analyses were performed. These sensitivity analyses were based on the modification of the basic clinical and economic assumptions in the clinical outcome model in order to test the stability of the conclusions of the analysis over a range of assumptions, probability estimates and value judgements. If the preferred strategy remained stable over the entire range of plausible values for a given parameter, then the model is insensitive to values within the range of that parameter.&#8221;</P>
