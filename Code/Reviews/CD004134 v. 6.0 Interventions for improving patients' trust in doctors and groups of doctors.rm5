<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-27 14:21:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trust is a fundamental part of a patient-doctor relationship, and is associated with increased patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care, although blind trust may on occasion facilitate poor care. We wished to know if there are effective ways of enhancing patient trust in doctors, by involving doctors (e.g. training) or patients (e.g. by providing information).</P>
<P>We searched a wide variety of databases on 18 March 2013 and identified 10 diverse studies, all randomised controlled clinical trials, with 11,063 participants, that met the review's inclusion criteria. Seven of the trials were new for this update. Overall, they did not provide sufficient evidence that a specific intervention affects trust. All were undertaken in the United States. Two were government funded, while seven were funded by charitable trusts and one by a Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO).</P>
<P>Interventions were of three main types; three employed additional physician training, four were education for patients and three provided additional information about doctors in terms of financial incentives or consulting style.</P>
<P>Two trialled physician training interventions to improve behaviours known to be associated with trust. The interventions showed no change in the patients' trust in their physician. The third trial showed that training oncologists in communication skills resulted in a small increase in trust.</P>
<P>Two trials examined group educational visits for uninsured diabetic patients. The first showed a small increase in trust, but the second showed no changes in trust. Another trial examined the effects of three types of educational introductory visits on new patients' trust in the doctors working for their health organisation. Trust in the doctors rose with one type of visit, in which patients were seen as a group. However, this was the least well taken up compared with individual visits with a physician, or a physician and health educator. A further trial explored helping patients decide about taking a statin by providing information and a chance to discuss options. This did not significantly increase trust.</P>
<P>Two trials explored disclosing to patients the incentives doctors are given for practising medicine in a cost-effective way via insurance plans. One trial led to no reduction and possibly an increase in trust. However, the plan information emphasised reducing unnecessary tests, rather than cost-cutting. The other trial showed no decrease in trust with disclosure. A final trial matched patients to doctors depending on their beliefs about care. Although some aspects of the doctor-patient relationship were improved, trust was not significantly affected. There was no evidence of harm from any of the studies. </P>
<P>The review was constrained by the lack of consistency between trust measurements, timeframes and populations. We have highlighted the types of further trials that are required to explore the impact of doctors' specific training or the use of a patient-centred or decision-sharing approach on patients' trust. Particularly, there is a need for international studies over longer follow-up periods in different healthcare systems.<I>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-24 18:53:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trust is a fundamental component of the patient-doctor relationship and is associated with increased satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care. Our 2006 review found little evidence that interventions improve patients' trust in their doctor; therefore an updated search was required to find out if there is further evidence of the effects of interventions that may improve trust in doctors or groups of doctors.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-02-12 12:03:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To update our earlier review assessing the effects of interventions intended to improve patients' trust in doctors or a group of doctors.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-12 12:03:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>In 2003 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Health Star, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, African Trials Register, African Health Anthology, Dissertation Abstracts International and the bibliographies of studies selected for inclusion. We also contacted researchers active in the field. We updated and re-ran the searches on available original databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>issue 2, 2013), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (Ebsco)) as well as Proquest Dissertations and Current Contents for the period 2003 to 18 March 2013.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-06-24 18:57:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Alexandra K B Rolfe">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series of interventions (informative, educational, behavioural, organisational) directed at doctors or patients (or carers) where trust was assessed as a primary or secondary outcome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-12 12:04:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Where mentioned, we extracted data on adverse effects. We synthesised data narratively.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-27 14:21:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 10 randomised controlled trials (including 7 new trials) involving 11,063 patients. These studies were all undertaken in North America, and all but two involved primary care.  As expected, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies.  Interventions were of three main types; three employed additional physician training, four were education for patients and three provided additional information about doctors in terms of financial incentives or consulting style. Additionally, several different measures of trust were employed.</P>
<P>The studies gave conflicting results. Trials showing a small but statistically-significant increase in trust included: a trial of physician disclosure of financial incentives; a trial of providing choice of physician based on concordance between patient and physician beliefs about care; a trial of group visits for new inductees into a Health Maintenance Organisation; a trial of training oncologists in communication skills; and a trial of group visits for diabetic patients. However, trust was not affected in a subsequent larger trial of group visits for uninsured people with diabetes, nor with a decision aid for helping choose statins, another trial of disclosure of financial incentives or specifically training doctors to increase trust or cultural competence. There was no evidence of harm from any of the studies. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-27 14:21:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude that any intervention may increase or decrease trust in doctors. This may be due in part to the sensitivity of trust instruments, and a ceiling effect, as trust in doctors is generally high. It may be that current measures of trust are insufficiently sensitive. Further trials are required to explore the impact of doctors' specific training or the use of a patient-centred or decision-sharing approach on patients' trust, especially in the areas of healthcare provider choice, and induction into healthcare organisation. International trials would be of particular benefit. The review was constrained by the lack of consistency between trust measurements, timeframes and populations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-17 01:44:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The patient-doctor relationship has an important role in the delivery of medical care, providing a context in which caring and healing can occur. Trust is a fundamental component of this relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Emanuel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emanuel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1997</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">What is trust?</HEADING>
<P>The word 'trust' is commonly used interchangeably with terms such as 'confidence', 'have faith in' and 'believe in'. Trust is an important everyday concept defined as 'worthiness of being relied on; fidelity; a resting on the integrity, friendship of another' (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 1983</LINK>). Yet, in the scientific realm, different aspects or features of trust are emphasised. For the purposes of this review we will focus on its descriptions within medicine. Most of the literature divides trust in two categories: trust in the medical profession as a whole (or the healthcare system as a whole) and trust in a particular medical practitioner. While we take into consideration that social and personal trust are related, we focus on interventions to improve trust in individual doctors or related groups of doctors (for example within a Health Maintenance Organisation).</P>
<P>Various definitions and conceptualisations of trust have been developed within medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Dibben-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dibben 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hupcey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hupcey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996b</LINK>). Mechanic and Schlesinger define trust as "the expectations of the public that those who serve them will perform their responsibilities in a technically proficient way (competence), that they will assume responsibility and not inappropriately defer to others (control), and that they will make their patients' welfare their highest priority (agency)" (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996b</LINK>). Dibben, interestingly, defines trust as the process by which barriers to co-operation and compliance are overcome (<LINK REF="REF-Dibben-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dibben 2000</LINK>). Hall sees trust as inseparable from vulnerability, and that trust has a subjective component that requires an optimistic acceptance of vulnerability (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>). This relies on a central feature of all definitions of trust, namely the belief on the part of the patient that their doctor will put their interests first - another example of agency (<LINK REF="REF-Barefoot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barefoot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newcomer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcomer 1997</LINK>), together with caring and respect (<LINK REF="REF-Lupton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lupton 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trust is seen as a global attribute of treatment relationships, one that encompasses subsidiary features such as satisfaction, communication, competency, and privacy, each of which is important in its own right (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>). Satisfaction differs from trust in that it is essentially retrospective, whereas trust reflects an expectation of the quality of an ongoing relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Balkrishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkrishnan 2003</LINK>). In relation to trust, the moral integrity and personal quality of the doctor are named as crucial (<LINK REF="REF-Crawshaw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawshaw 1995</LINK>) and must also include professional knowledge and skills (<LINK REF="REF-Emanuel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emanuel 1995</LINK>). While trust may be seen to have several attributes, for example, fidelity, competence, honesty and confidentiality, researchers have been unable to track these individual components. Trust in doctors is thus seen as a uni-dimensional construct (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, we employed a broad definition of patient trust, i.e.: 'The belief that a doctor is working in the patient's best interests'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patients' views</HEADING>
<P>According to patients, trust is built largely on a doctor's interpersonal competence (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1997</LINK>). Doctors' behaviours that are associated with trust include: thoroughly evaluating problems, understanding a patient's individual experience, compassion, empathy, advocacy, reliability and dependability, communicating clearly and completely, continuity of care, building a partnership, giving time in the consultation, providing appropriate and effective treatment, and being honest and respectful to the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Keating-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keating 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lupton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lupton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarrant-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarrant 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2001</LINK>). Additionally there is some evidence of an association between the practice of patient-centred care and good communication and increased trust among patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fiskella-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiskella 2004</LINK>). The notion of the 'good doctor' rests very strongly on notions of trust, of feeling able to share one's intimate feelings, allowing another person to touch one's body and of following his/her advice (<LINK REF="REF-Lupton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lupton 1996</LINK>). Interestingly, patients view trust as an iterative process, and commonly test their doctors against knowledge and expectations (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 2000</LINK>). Most importantly, patients refer to learnable skills and not simply to personality characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 2000</LINK>). Patients' trust in institutions (e.g. health insurers or health services) is somewhat lower than trust in individual doctors (<LINK REF="REF-LaVeist-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaVeist 2000</LINK>). There is a strong correlation between patients' individual trust in a physician and the physician's institution, but it is not clear which influences which the most (<LINK REF="REF-Kao-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1998b</LINK>). Patient trust in the physician may be influenced by the policy of the insurer or health plan. For example, trust appears to be higher among patients who have been given more choice in their doctor (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>). Patient characteristics associated with trust include race (white patients state they have more trust in their doctor than non-white patients do) and religion (religious people are more trusting than non-religious people) (<LINK REF="REF-Benjamins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2009</LINK>)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interest in trust</HEADING>
<P>Trust has become a prominent healthcare issue in the last decade, not only among patients and doctors, but also among authorities, policy-makers and the public in general. Various studies have found (<LINK REF="REF-Doescher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doescher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grumbach-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grumbach 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kao-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safran 2001</LINK>), and many authors have advocated that much more should be done to preserve trust (<LINK REF="REF-Cusack-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cusack 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fugelli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillman 1998</LINK>). Although the majority of patients still trust doctors to act in their best interests, there is growing concern that trust is declining (<LINK REF="REF-Emanuel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emanuel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 2000</LINK>). In the main, this is attributed to changes in healthcare systems which in various ways affect the patient-doctor relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shortell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortell 1998</LINK>), for example: by preventing patients from developing a personal ongoing relationship with the doctor; by shortening consultation times; and by providing potentially conflicting incentives to doctors, such as dual responsibilities to patients and to third-party purchasers of health care. Increased autonomy among patients and access to potentially conflicting information from the Internet may also contribute to an erosion of trust. Such factors may work within wider societal changes, which aim to redefine trust in all professions (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Functions of trust</HEADING>
<P>Even well-informed and knowledgeable patients have to rely on their doctors to work in their best interest, which includes providing the best care possible, educating, and keeping personal information confidential. Trust may enable the patient to accept the doctor's recommendation for self-monitoring and may reduce worries as to whether everything needed has been done. If clinicians feel trusted, it may be less likely that they will practice defensive medicine, for example ordering investigations to prevent litigation when these are more likely to confuse than clarify the picture, with minimal chance of a missed diagnosis. Patients' trust in their doctors may be important in the management of both chronic illness (for example trust is associated with promoting adherence to exercise or drug regimens in the control of hypertension) and acute illness (for example in overcoming suspicion when opiates are prescribed for pain control) (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, some 40% of all new problems presented to general practitioners are non-specific and never evolve into a defined diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kroenke-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroenke 1989</LINK>). Such problems can often be dealt with by reassuring the patient that a serious outcome is unlikely and negotiating return if the problem does not resolve within a few days or weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Rosser-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosser 2001</LINK>). Such 'wait and see' policies, where appropriate, both reduce unnecessary medicalisation of non-specific problems, and save the costs of tests. On the other hand, 'blind' trust may deter the patient from, for example, asking questions when this is necessary and important. Trust implies a prediction about the future and thus requires some balance between risk and protective behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 2000</LINK>). To estimate the risk of trusting the doctor or to behave protectively, for example by asking more questions or by seeking a second opinion, is often, however, very difficult if not impossible for patients. Yet seeking a second opinion can be seen as acknowledging that doctors also have limits, which they honestly admit, rather than that they are not trusted (<LINK REF="REF-Car-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Car 2005</LINK>). When studying trust, we cannot avoid the issue of trustworthiness. It is important that doctors keep themselves worthy of trust, for example by avoiding conflicts of interest between their personal gain and the welfare of the patient. The assumption that doctors are trustworthy may unfortunately not always be correct. On these occasions, a lack of trust is an advantage and may help the patient avoid detrimental or even tragic outcomes. Therefore, interventions to improve trust must not decrease clinical standards.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trust as an outcome</HEADING>
<P>Trust grows in the context of an ongoing relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Kao-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1998a</LINK>). Trust is considered to be an important outcome reinforcing the patient-doctor partnership (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 2000</LINK>); but trust is associated with several other potential benefits, including increased satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care (<LINK REF="REF-Baloush_x002d_Kleinman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baloush-Kleinman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safran 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2001</LINK>). In contrast, problematic experiences are strongly related to reduced trust (<LINK REF="REF-Keating-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keating 2002</LINK>). With untrustworthy doctors, care may be appropriately refused by patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dibben-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dibben 2000</LINK>). When trust is breached, it is the patient who suffers (for example, by undergoing unnecessary procedures).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions which may influence trust</HEADING>
<P>It is conceivable that a variety of parameters associated with increased trust might be applied as interventions to improve patients' trust in their doctors. For example:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Interventions to improve communication skills (e.g. encouraging a patient-centred approach or the expression of empathy);</LI>
<LI>Interventions which demonstrate the doctors' openness and honesty (e.g. disclosure of financial incentives to limit costly investigations or treatment, or other incentives (research publications, published league tables) which might influence care);</LI>
<LI>Interventions to emphasise confidentiality (e.g. regularly emphasising the confidential nature of the doctor-patient relationship through leaflets or by word of mouth);</LI>
<LI>Interventions which may demonstrate doctors' technical competence (e.g. by advertising doctors' qualifications or compliance with continuing professional development);</LI>
<LI>Interventions which may enhance the professionalism of the doctor (e.g. by the way the doctor dresses);</LI>
<LI>Interventions to improve continuity of care;</LI>
<LI>Interventions to improve access to care (patients may have more trust in a doctor who appears to make him or herself available to them);</LI>
<LI>Interventions to encourage doctors to demonstrate caring by providing measures which might be seen as additional to normal care, for example educational interventions; and</LI>
<LI>Interventions to enable patients' choice of doctor.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Measures of trust</HEADING>
<P>Recent research has demonstrated that trust is a coherent psychological construct that can be reliably measured; it is possible to distinguish between trust and satisfaction, which is said to be the most similar 'construct' (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>). Different measurement instruments have been developed to evaluate patient trust (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eveleigh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eveleigh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grumbach-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grumbach 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kao-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kao-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safran 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>). The scales cover different dimensions of trust, and these multiple dimensions are emphasised. Some scales relate trust to predictors or consequences of trust, but all scales are broadly consistent with the theoretical concept of patient trust (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>). Important, especially for the purposes of this review, is the finding by Hall (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>) and others (<LINK REF="REF-Kao-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kao 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2002</LINK>) that patient trust is built holistically and that trust behaves as if it had only one dimension, although it is a construct with several dimensions (for example, fidelity, honesty, competence, confidentiality). No matter which dimensions of trust are covered in the scale, these items strongly correlate with the overall degree of trust. Hall and colleagues suggest that although trust contains several dimensions, each of which influences it, people do not, in fact, distinguish between them (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent research suggests that while trust in individual doctors, in the medical profession as a whole and in insurance plans is partly influenced by the same factors (the amount of contact, adequacy of choice in selecting physician or insurer), trust in individual doctors is also related to the frequency with which patients seek care and their preference for control in medical decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Balkrishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkrishnan 2003</LINK>). In contrast, trust in insurance plans is much more closely related to satisfaction.</P>
<P>However patient trust is defined, it is increasingly a focus of study. In part, this is because the preservation, enhancement, and justification of trust are fundamental goals of medical ethics, but more because it is now challenged rather than taken for granted.</P>

<P>Views on trust are likely to differ between various people. Therefore, before conducting the original review (<LINK REF="REF-McKinstry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinstry 2006</LINK>) we sought consumers for a multidisciplinary advisory group aimed at providing a range of perspectives and a personal experience of trust in the doctor. The group was intended to involve healthy people as well as people with various illnesses (chronic and acute). We contacted potential members by email, and gave them background information about this systematic review, its methodology and a description of their role as an advisory group member, allowing them to discuss and comment on the protocol for the review and the interpretation of the findings.</P>
<P>The advisory group was asked to consider whether there were other effects or influences we had not taken into consideration; whether some effects or influences might be difficult to recognise or assess; and whether there were other specific sub-questions we should be trying to answer (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2004</LINK>). We asked members to consider whether some effects or influences are more or less important than others, and whether they knew of any relevant studies, literature or publications. Further, we asked them for their opinion about the interventions that are identified in the review and what would increase their trust in the doctor.</P>
<P>The three lay reviewers applauded the merits of the original review and felt that their suggestions for the review had already been covered.</P>

<P>All of the included studies were published in English and were conducted in North America, and all but two (<LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>) took place in primary care.</P>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies in terms of their aims, and the format and content of the interventions and their measures of trust. Four interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK>) focused on community-based family doctors, one on hospital-based oncologists (<LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>) and one (<LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>) on diabetologists. Four interventions focused on patients in Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> used training interventions directed to the participating doctors, however they were applied in very different contexts: the first in routine primary care, the second aimed at improving cross-cultural sensitivity with Hispanic patients and the third in hospital oncologists. Although <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> employed outcome measures both based on Anderson's 'Trust in Physician Scale', Thom modified this by changing the wording (which he subsequently validated) and transforming the output from an 11 to 55 scale to a 0 to 100 scale, rendering comparison difficult. Impact on trust was the primary outcome in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>), whilst it was the secondary outcome in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>). (see below)</P>
<P>The unit of randomisation was the doctor in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>) and the patient in the other six studies.</P>
<P>We identified no experimental studies which specifically looked for harm as a result of misplaced trust or no trust/lack of trust.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definitions of trust</HEADING>
<P>Of the 10 studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> provided a specific definition of trust in the doctor-patient relationship, namely "the belief or confidence that the physician will provide reliable information and will act in the patients' interests". The other studies used validated measures of trust, or trust was measured as part of a more generic validated scale.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of the interventions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1) Aims and conceptual bases of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>Three studies assessed educational interventions aimed at doctors, namely coaching in trust-promoting behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>); increasing cultural competency (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK>) and improving empathic responses (<LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>). Four studies explored the impact of different forms of patient education on trust. <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> evaluated the impact on trust of providing diabetic patients with a treatment decision aid to help them choose regarding statin treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK> explored if educational group visits for uninsured or underinsured type II diabetics increased trust in the healthcare provider. <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> explored the impact of educational health and loyalty visits on new enrollees of an HMO on trust. Three studies explored the effects of providing additional information to patients about their doctor: either the impact of disclosing the physician incentives and financial conflicts of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK>), or in order to promote informed choice (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK>). Six of the studies had as their primary aim to determine the impact of an intervention on physician trust, and four measured trust as a secondary outcome of an intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2) Timing, intensity and general content of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>The interventions' timing and intensity varied within and between types of interventions. In brief, in the studies of disclosure or enhanced information about physicians, the intervention amounted to as little as access to a website or written or telephone information about the clinician (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK>); whereas the clinician education ranged from a one-day workshop (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>) through three 1.5 hour sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK>), to <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> who videoed a series of participant consultations and provided personalised feedback on the clinicians' consultations with illustrative video-clips.</P>
<P>The patient educational interventions ranged between a monthly 2-hour educational visit for 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK>) and a single educational session with a nurse or doctor (<LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3) Characteristics of participants providing interventions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Medical education:</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>, doctors' training was conducted by two academic family practice physicians and a sociologist who had previously led focus groups on patient-physician trust. The control group had no additional training.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> the instructors in the interventions included the authors of the paper, two other doctors with expertise in cultural competency and experts in training and the use of interpreters. The control group received feedback on patient-assessed cultural competency only.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> the intervention was provided by the investigators, which included medical doctors and sociologists.They provided a personalised CD with annotated videoclips gleaned from videotapes made by the participant. The control group received a lecture on empathy and communication delivered by the investigators and were given a CD with general information not tailored to their own consultations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patient education:</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> the decision aid was developed with extensive input from patients with diabetes as well as clinicians (endocrinologists and primary care physicians) The control intervention was a standard information pamphlet. The intervention was either provided by a researcher before the patient saw the clinician or by the clinician themselves. The control group did not receive the decision aid.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> the educational intervention was led by both a primary care internal medicine physician and a diabetes nurse educator. Prior to the study both had to read pertinent literature and the orientation manual. They were then trained at a regional centre and observed several group visits in session. <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK> used the same intervention except that the trainer was a physician who had previously conducted group visit training.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> there were three levels of intervention. The doctor-only intervention was carried out by 20 doctors from the HMO. These doctors received one hour's orientation to the tools and goals of the visits. The doctor followed by health educator intervention included doctors from the HMO as above with whom the patient was usually subsequently empanelled. The health educators were two registered nurses and two health educators (no details were provided of their specific training for this role). The intervention groups were led by a doctor and health educators who had received one day's training on the curriculum with videotaped feedback to improve their presentation and facilitation styles.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Disclosure of financial incentives and enhanced information about physician:</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> the disclosure interventions were devised by the study authors with the assistance of 'an expert panel'. The nature of the person carrying out the telephone follow-up to clarify the disclosure and ensure comprehension was not recorded.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> the intervention, a disclosure letter, was designed by the chief medical officer of each medical groups with the goal of providing enough information for the subject to make an informed choice about their provider.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> the intervention was provided by the HMO. The specific information about the providers was either provided by a research assistant by telephone or by a specific web-site.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4) Characteristics of the participants</HEADING>
<P>All studies recorded age, gender, education and basic ethnicity and a measure of health status of the participants. All were adults. The broad characteristics of the participants are summarised here. Further information is given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
<P>In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK>) the interventions targeted patients of HMOs; four (<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK>), family practitioners and their patients; one (<LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>) oncologists and their patients; and one (<LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>) diabetologists and their patients.</P>
<P>The studies varied in their participant recruitment strategies. <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> recruited local doctors who had expressed an interest in the physician-patient relationship and they in turn recruited patients attending their practices. <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> recruited physicians and patients, seen in the last 12 months with hypertension and/or diabetes, from rural and urban primary care practices. <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> recruited clinicians and their patients who had advanced cancer and of whom their clinician &#8220;would not be surprised if they died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within one year&#8221;. <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> considered all new patients joining the HMO from five centers. <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> selected patients through an electronic records search of 2000 patients attending a Primary Care Centre with an glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of more than 8.5%, serving a mainly deprived under-insured population. <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK> recruited in same way but allowed a slightly lower HBA1c level of over 8%. <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> selected patients who were aged 30 or older and not linked to a primary care provider. In <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK>, eligible patients were those who had type 2 diabetes, had been referred to the clinic, and had no contra-indications to a statin. In <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> eligible patients were aged over 25 and had been listed as a patient for more than a year with the medical insurer. <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> randomly selected patients who had been with their plan for at least 2 years and had seen a primary care physician at least twice.</P>
<P>Gender, age, ethnicity and number of participants varied widely between trials and further information can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes measured</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trust</HEADING>
<P>All studies measured patient trust in their physician, although several different measures of trust were used. In nine studies this was a measure of trust in a physician, but in <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> this was trust in "the health care professionals" at the HMO of which the patients were members. In <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK>, trust in the insurer was also measured.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> used a modified version of the Anderson and Dedrick 11-item trust scale (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1990</LINK>). This was modified to be suitable for use in primary care and the labelling on the scale changed to yield a lower mean score (to avoid a ceiling effect). The new scale was psychometrically evaluated before use (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> used the 7-likert response items in the trust sub-scale of the Primary Care Assessment Survey, a previously validated tool (<LINK REF="REF-Thom-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2006b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> measured trust using the previously validated Trust in Physician score (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> used a global statement rated on a 10-point scale to measure patients' trust that the physicians of their HMO had their best health interests as their top priority. Although this measure had face validity and was in the format of previously-validated knowledge scales, it is unclear if the scale was psychometrically tested or underwent formal validation studies. <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> used a 5-point Likert scale to measure trust, but it was difficult to assess whether this had been properly validated. <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> adapted a previously-used trust measured by adding an additional three questions, two of which had been developed before and not used, and one which was added for their study (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> used two previously-validated scales for measuring trust in physicians and insurers (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> describes the scales used for trust and how they compare.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>Five studies measured satisfaction. <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> used the Consumer Satisfaction Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> used a single global statement rated on a 10-point scale to measure satisfaction with the HMO. Although this measure had face validity and was in the format of previously-validated knowledge scales, it is unclear if the scale was psychometrically tested or underwent formal validation studies. <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> used 10 items from the previously validated patient satisfaction questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> measured satisfaction using 12 items based on the medical outcomes study (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> used the Patient Care Assessment Tool (PCAT), a well-validated tool for evaluating patient satisfaction in underserved populations (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Six studies measured knowledge levels. <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> checked the patients' knowledge of physician incentives. <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> measured knowledge of appropriate screening and immunisation schedules. <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> measured knowledge of method of compensation for the primary care physicians within the primary care group. The questions were developed from research instruments - some of which had been validated (<LINK REF="STD-Levison-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levison 2005</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> did not itself report knowledge, a linked paper from the same trial surveyed the knowledge of the patients about the merits of using statins using a 14-question tool (<LINK REF="REF-Weymiller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weymiller 2007</LINK>). There is no information about the validity of this questionnaire.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>In addition to the above outcomes, <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> measured number of referrals, diagnostic tests, proportion of visits to study physician, number of patients remaining with physician, and self-reported adherence.</P>
<P>Using a 10-point scale, <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> also measured intervention patients' perceptions of how helpful the induction visit was, if they had learned something which might save a visit in the future, if their questions had been answered, and, as a result, whether or not they perceived a need to have another appointment within the next month, their likelihood of staying with the HMO, their agreement with guidelines and likelihood to set goals for lifestyle improvement.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> measured prior disputes with physician and insurer and adequate choice of physician and insurer.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> also measured degree of confidence in knowing enough about physicians' methods of compensation to be able to judge the possible influence on healthcare decisions and loyalty to physicians and the physician groups. This was again taken from previously-designed research instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Levison-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levison 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> measured trust, only the linked paper by <LINK REF="REF-Weymiller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weymiller 2007</LINK> also measured patient perceptions of the information, willingness to recommend the way statins were discussed and desirability of the process.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> also measured cultural competency using the Patient Reported Physician Cultural Competence Scale (PRPCC), and some disease specific outcomes, to see if there had been a change in weight, blood pressure or HbA1c levels if relevant.</P>
<P>In addition to the above, <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> measured the amount of time the patients spent with their primary care provider, explanations, technical skills, personal manner, use of the latest technology, focus on prevention, concern for subject's well-being, listening skills, familiarity with subject's medical history, and level of shared decision making. In addition, it was recorded if a patient would recommend the physician to their friends and family.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> measured, in addition to trust, the frequency of empathic statements made by doctors, patients&#8217; perceptions of empathy, therapeutic alliance, and knowledge.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK> also measured perception of care by using domains of the PCAT survey such as cultural competency, community orientation and perception of continuity of care.</P>
<P>There were no reported measures in any of the studies of symptom resolution, change in health status, quality of life or self esteem. No data were presented on doctors' perception of patients' trust or perceptions regarding doctors' trustworthiness.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Medical education: trials training physicians in behaviours associated with trust</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> investigated the effect of training physicians on patients' trust in their physician, using a trust scale modified from <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1990</LINK>. The mean trust scores post intervention for intervention and control groups were 74.4 and 76.2 respectively. The net difference after baseline differences were considered was -0.6 in favour of control group participants, which was not significant. The trialists also found no significant differences in patient satisfaction (mean difference 0.5 in favour of intervention), humaneness (mean difference 3.8 in favour of intervention) or physician satisfaction (mean difference 2.3 in favour of control) (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In addition the trialists found no significant difference in referrals (mean difference 0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.28) or use of diagnostic tests (mean difference 0.1 in favour of control, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.68). There were similar non-significant differences found in the proportion of patients choosing to remain with the physician (difference 0.4% in favour of control), proportion of visits to the study physician (as opposed to other physicians) (difference 0.9% in favour of intervention) and the proportion of patients who described themselves as always adherent (difference 3.2% in favour of intervention).</P>
<P>The correlation between specific physician behaviours at the index visit and patient trust at six months was also examined. The five behaviours most correlated with trust were: 'letting you tell your story'; listening carefully; asking thoughtful questions; never interrupting, always taking time and explaining what you need to know about your problems. However these behaviours were among those that showed the least net difference between intervention and control physicians. No subgroup analyses were done as the trial was insufficiently powered to support these.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> evaluated the effect of training physicians in cultural competence on reducing health inequalities and improving patient care, comparing training in cultural competence to simple feedback of cultural competence scores. The trialists hypothesised that increased cultural competence would increase trust. Trust was measured using the seven Likert-response items in the trust subscale of the previously validated Primary Care Assessment Survey at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. There was no significant change in the outcomes from baseline to the end of the study in either group or between groups. The main change from baseline was 1.93 (standard deviation (SD) 8.6) in the training and feedback group and 2.54 (SD 15.6) in the feedback-only group, with a mean difference of 0.61 in favour of feedback-only (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The authors performed a post hoc subgroup analysis to determine if the intervention might be more effective depending on the characteristics of the population surveyed including number of visits, primary language, age, gender and lingual ability of physicians on trust, but found no significant relationship.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> evaluated whether oncologists who received a CD-ROM training program on communication skills that was personally tailored with exemplars from their own audio-recorded clinic visits would increase oncologists' ability to empathise with negative emotions expressed by cancer patients. They hypothesised that such improvement would also result in increased trust. Patients whose oncologists were in the intervention group reported very slightly higher trust in their oncologists (as measured by the Trust in Physician Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1990</LINK>)) than patients whose oncologists did not receive the CD-ROM; this difference was statistically significant (mean difference 0.1 (95% CI 0.0 to 0.2), P = 0.036). Patients in the intervention group experienced significantly greater perceived empathy as well as a significantly greater sense that their oncologists understood them as &#8220;a whole person&#8221;. Oncologists in the intervention group used significantly more empathic statements and were significantly more likely to respond to negative emotions empathically than control group oncologists (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient education: trials involving educational interventions for patients</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> investigated the effect of three different types of enrolment visit (traditional doctor only, doctor with health educator, and group visit led by doctor and educator) on trust of health plan health professionals, loyalty, satisfaction, perceived knowledge of screening and immunisation programmes, and patients' perception of their own healthy lifestyle (all rated on a 1 to 10 scale). In addition, patients were tested on their knowledge of screening and immunisation programmes. This test varied according to gender and age and was scored as a percentage of total possible score.</P>
<P>Trust of the health plan health professionals rose significantly following the visit in comparison with control for only one type of visit (the group visit) (change in control 0.3 versus change in group visit 1.9, difference 1.6). Patients attending group visits and the 'doctor and health educator' were significantly more likely than controls to say they would stay with the plan. Patients also described significantly increased satisfaction and improved knowledge of screening immunisation and lifestyle issues and to say they agreed with HMO guidelines (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Information on these outcomes was also presented for patients who had refused visits and failed to attend. These two groups had similar results to the control group. However, the analyses were not done on an intention-to-treat basis. This may be important, as the group visit intervention which had the most positive effect had a large number of refusers and failures to attend. No subgroup analyses by demography or ethnicity were presented.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK> evaluated the effects of group educational visits on underinsured or uninsured patients with type 2 diabetes mainly on delivering care. Trust was evaluated as a secondary outcome using the Trust in Physician scale. In addition, measures of quality of care and feasibility and acceptability of the group visits were evaluated using the primary care assessment tool.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> the authors found that overall there was a significant increase in the total trust score for the patients who attended the group visits compared to those who received usual care; they provide means for each component of the trust questionnaire but do not provide the actual total trust score (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Furthermore, the authors stated that significant positive increases occurred in the patients' perception of co-ordination of care, community orientation and cultural competency.</P>
<P>The trial was essentially repeated in <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK>. On this occasion the authors found that there was no significant difference in trust between patients in the group visit arm and those receiving usual care. Again, detailed results were not provided, but there were significant positive increases in patients' perception of co-ordination of care, community orientation and cultural competency.</P>
<P>In the trial of a treatment decision aid for a statin in a diabetic population, <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> explored acceptability of the aid, knowledge about options and cardiovascular risk, decisional conflict and adherence to pill-taking three months after the initial visit. Trust, measured using the previously validated Trust in Physician scale, was a secondary outcome. There was a non-significant trend towards higher total trust in the decision aid group. While two of the nine items in the scale showed significant differences from control, the remaining seven items did not, and there was no overall difference between the groups. Patients who received the intervention were significantly more likely to 'trust their doctor to tell them if a mistake had been made about treatment' and 'to listen well so that he/she understands their needs and concerns' (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). Other outcomes for this study included a significantly increased knowledge score, and significantly less decisional conflict among intervention group participants. Overall the likelihood of having total trust in the physician was associated with an improvement in knowledge, lower decisional conflict and greater patient participation in decision making. However, increase in trust was not associated with an increase in adherence to the statins.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Doctors' incentives: trials including disclosure of financial incentives and enhanced information about physician</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> investigated whether disclosure of physician incentives to patients in two different sorts of health plan (capitated or mixed incentive plans) changed trust in the physician or the health insurer (measured on two validated scales). A very small, non-significant increase in trust from baseline occurred in both intervention groups and both control groups. Physician trust was scored out of 50. There was a small, statistically significant, increase in trust in people who were in the capitated plan following disclosure. After adjustment for baseline group differences as well as time effects, the disclosure was associated with a 1.4% increase in physician trust (P &lt; 0.05) in one of the intervention groups (capitated plan). (Insufficient data were provided to confirm the calculation or calculate confidence intervals). The authors stated that this was a robust result across a variety of regression models and was also significant when the unadjusted bivariate results were considered.</P>
<P>There were no other significant differences for the mixed incentive plans and there was no significant difference in insurer trust in either group, or in physician trust in the other intervention group (mixed incentive plan). The percentage of the population with substantial knowledge of physician incentives rose significantly as a result of the intervention in both health plans. When a subgroup of patients with substantial knowledge of incentives in the post-intervention period was observed, the authors state there was a significant doubling of the effect on physician trust of the capitated intervention group (P = 0.01), however the data on which this assertion was based were not presented. Patients with initially low physician trust scores showed no significant change in trust following the intervention. There was no significant difference in the impact of disclosure in different racial groups. Length of enrolment in plan made no difference to either score. Insurer trust was scored on a Likert scale with a maximum score of 55. The mean difference in change in trust in insurer between control and intervention was 0.0 (SD 6.8) in the capitated plan and 0.0 (SD 7.1) in the mixed incentive pan. These effects persisted after adjustment for baseline group differences as well as time effects.The authors also report a subgroup analysis which showed that although disclosure made no significant difference to desire to change physician, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in the desire to change insurers, even though the measurement of trust in insurers was not affected. This suggests that the insurance trust instrument used may not be sufficiently sensitive.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> evaluated the importance of the disclosure of financial incentives in allowing the patient to gain knowledge of the physicians' payment methods and also, as secondary outcomes, how this influenced trust and loyalty. They measured trust with a previously used (although poorly described) scale, after a disclosure letter had been sent to the intervention group. Questionnaires were sent to all participants about 8 to 12 weeks later, in two sites. The disclosure statement did not affect their trust in their physician mean difference -1.0 in intervention group (P = 0.71)) but improved their loyalty to the medical group (mean difference 3.2 (P = 0.03) in one of the sites studied. This difference increased when only those patients who could recall being sent the disclosure statement were considered (P &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> matched patients seeking a new primary care provider (PCP) and practitioners, based on beliefs about care, by either giving patients an informed choice or a guided choice (intervention) which took into account patient and provider preferences for shared decision making. The authors measured trust using a nine-item trust scale with responses to each item scored on a five-point Likert scale. The trial also explored the effect of the intervention on patient satisfaction, using an adapted version of the medical outcomes survey, and patients' perception of the process using a specifically-designed scale.</P>
<P>During the intervention period, 85% of subjects obtained a PCP. Intervention subjects significantly were more likely to perceive that they chose their PCP ( mean difference 56%; P &lt; 0.001), to retain their primary care provider at 1 year (mean difference 24%; P &lt; 0.001), and to report greater overall satisfaction with the PCP (mean difference 10%; P &lt; 0.01), compared to control subjects who were assigned to a PCP. The intervention subjects also reported greater trust in their PCP on most measures (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>), but these differences did not remain statistically significant after adjustments for patient age, gender, ethnicity, education, and health status. There was a significantly increased perception that the clinician knew their patient well (mean difference 14.5%; P &lt; 0.01).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-02-17 13:14:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The purpose of seeking interventions that are helpful in promoting trust is based on the assumption that a variety of desirable attributes such as medication adherence, satisfaction, and continuity of care are associated with global measures of trust. However, these are associations, and there is little evidence that interventions that might improve global trust will necessarily also increase these attributes. Trust is not straightforward to define. While only one study provided a definition of trust (based on the belief that the doctor is acting in the patient's interests), all the studies used instruments based at least in part on this definition. The instruments used to measure trust in <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> were devised, in part, in discussion with consumers. However only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>) reported consumer input to plan the content of the intervention. We found relatively few high-quality intervention studies which explored the impact on trust in three ways: providing information about the doctor; improving aspects of the doctors consultation skills; and providing educational interventions to patients.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-15 22:39:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review was only able to find ten moderate-quality studies which specifically addressed the issue of improving patients' trust in physicians. We identified eight studies that evaluated interventions which were intended to promote patient trust and two studies that had the potential to decrease patient trust, but did not. The studies gave conflicting results. For trials which did show a statistically-significant improvement in trust, the increase was, in real terms, very small. . The trials showing an increase in trust included: a trial of physician disclosure of financial incentives; a trial of providing choice of physician based on concordance between patients and physician beliefs about care; a trial of group visits for new inductees into a health maintenance organisation; a trial of training oncologists in communication skills; and a trial of group visits for diabetic patients. However, trust was not affected in a subsequent larger trial of group visits for uninsured people with diabetes, nor with a decision aid for helping choose statins, another trial for disclosure of financial incentives or specifically training doctors to increase trust or cultural competence. There was no evidence of harm from any of the studies.</P>
<P>While the strength of this review lies in thoroughness of searching for robust interventions that may affect trust, the lack of high-quality trials does mean that limited conclusions can be draw from it. Additionally, the review is limited by the fact that trust is a difficult and often subjective concept which in many cases may be better understood through different research methods, such as qualitative approaches. Also, trust in doctors and groups of doctors is generally high anyway, so it maybe that ceiling effects frustrate the possibility of demonstrating anything other than small changes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-02-15 22:39:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is a reasonably new area of research, so it is perhaps unsurprising that there were so few high-quality intervention studies. One of the recent drivers for such research, and interest in trust in general, has been the rise of managed care in the United States and the perception that such care has the potential to damage the doctor-patient relationship, given that the doctor has duties not only to the patient, but also to minimising costs for the insurer (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1996b</LINK>). Although the rise in the use of guidelines in many countries has provoked similar concerns, it is not surprising that all of the identified studies are North American and it would be valuable to further validate the 'trust' measures so that they could be applied to other settings. Additionally, we contacted four authors involved in the identified studies who continue to be active in this field. They confirmed that, to their knowledge, no other such studies had been performed. The lack of high-quality studies and the heterogeneity of those we identified makes it difficult to understand how these interventions could have policy or clinical implications. Further, the interventions were targeted at specific groups and with no more than two interventions targeting the same group the applicability to other groups or settings is difficult to assess.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-02-17 13:14:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As with all educational interventions implemented in one centre, it is difficult to conclude from the experience of <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> that training in behaviours associated with trust is effective or ineffective. The results are unlikely to be solely due to the ability of the studies to detect a difference. Although the <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> study was powered to find only a relatively large difference between intervention and control, in fact the actual change in trust measured was slightly negative when baseline measurements were taken into account, so power was unlikely to have been an issue. The physician behaviours found to be associated with trust in this study did not change significantly, so perhaps it is unsurprising that trust in the physician did not change either. Indeed it appeared that the skills found to be associated with trust in the study were not particularly focused upon in training. Other research has shown that multiple training sessions, with opportunities to practice new skills between sessions, may be more effective than one session (<LINK REF="STD-Barkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barkin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roter 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Time-frame could perhaps be a limitation of the studies as it may take time to 'earn' trust (<LINK REF="REF-Ozawa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozawa 2013</LINK>). As a result, in <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 2006</LINK> it is not clear whether it was specifically this training package that was ineffective, or if all such packages are likely to be ineffective. Ideally several types of training should have been piloted for effectiveness before selecting one for trial. It is noteworthy that <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> targeted physicians who were already interested in communication and perhaps had less to gain than others from such an intervention. Finally, it may be that the presentation of new behaviours without an underlying attitudinal shift may not convince patients that their doctor is more worthy of trust. Further research is required to explore this type of intervention. In contrast, the success of <LINK REF="STD-Tulsky-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tulsky 2011</LINK> in enhancing trust may have been due to the intensity of the intervention, which was personally tailored to the doctor based on his or her own consultations, and which did demonstrate a change in the desired skill (empathic response to patient disclosure).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2001</LINK> concluded that one type of patient induction event (the group visit) was effective at increasing trust in 'the health professionals' in their health maintenance organisation (HMO). This conclusion must be treated with some caution, however. Less than half of those who were invited attended any of the interventions, falling to 27% in the case of group visits. Of these, 75% of attendees completed both questionnaires. While some of the non-attenders/refusers were subsequently followed up by questionnaire, responses were lower (around 65%). An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis may have reduced any advantage this type of intervention had over others. There are also concerns about the validity of the measure used. As with educational interventions for clinicians above, it is difficult to generalise from the results of a study of an educational intervention carried out by a relatively small group of professionals (particularly health educators who numbered only three and may be enthusiasts). It is not possible to know if such an intervention would work if carried out in a different HMO by different educators. Further work is required to elucidate this and should be carried on an ITT basis. The two Clancy trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2007</LINK>) and that of <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> looked at interventions designed to improve patient outcomes with group visits and a decision aid to help diabetic patients choose statins respectively. They came to conflicting conclusions; <LINK REF="STD-Clancy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clancy 2003</LINK> showed a significant difference between groups in trust overall, but more in some aspects of trust than others. This was not replicated in the follow-on trial which showed no improvements in trust. This is interesting as the second trial was larger and looked at more providers (six compared to one). Both trials were well managed and structured and overall did show improvements in other outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Nannenga-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nannenga 2009</LINK> showed that trust is not increased by a decision aid and interestingly nor were clinical outcomes, although the patient experience was.</P>
<P>The interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> were specific disclosures about physician benefits with reference to particular health plans. The projects were conducted against a backdrop of concern that such disclosures might reduce trust in doctors. According to the study authors in <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK>, the disclosure intervention was set in a positive way, emphasising the impact of incentives on reducing 'unnecessary' rather than 'expensive' screening and treatment. Nevertheless, it was a well-conducted study that made strenuous efforts to follow up participants, and the finding that such disclosures (albeit positively phrased) did not reduce trust is likely to be robust, as is the finding that trust in some patient groups (those who had learned most about incentives from the intervention) was increased. <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> described how, with respect to affecting trust in physicians, the number of individual tests a physician prescribes is unimportant, but experience, number of patients and their complexity are important. However, unlike <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> the authors did not find that the disclosures made a significant difference to level of trust. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2006</LINK> was less robust than <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002</LINK> in follow-up of patients. These studies, however, were carried out by only three HMOs, so to further prove the robustness of the studies, research in other HMOs is required. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2003</LINK> indicated that helping a patient to choose their provider by allowing the patient to choose a doctor whose views are similar does significantly increase trust, and this does not disappear when adjusted for patient variables. However, over half the eligible subjects did not return their questionnaires. Also limiting the usefulness of this trial are that it was set in a single group model healthcare centre and the trialists only measured the outcomes at one point in time. This would need to be replicated on a larger scale with more time points for it to be more robust. However, this aside, it introduces an interesting concept and one that should definitely be explored further.</P>
<P>Put together, these studies suggest that trust in a doctor is a difficult characteristic to improve, at least among people willing to take part in enhanced educational activities (who may already have high levels of trust). Exploring the impact on trust of intensive educational interventions, for example pulmonary rehabilitation, which also improve clinical outcomes fairly immediately, may be more positive.</P>

<P>We believe that we have identified all the studies of interventions thought to have an impact on trust that met our study design criteria up to March 2013, as we had a comprehensive search strategy which identified over 14,000 records for this update alone, and independent assessment of studies for inclusion. There may be some unpublished trials we have missed. However we contacted authors involved in the identified studies who continue to be active in this field. They confirmed that, to their knowledge, no other such studies had been performed. For future updates of the review we will additionally search online trials registries and again update the database search strategies to take into account any changes in indexing and search syntax before searches are run.</P>

<P>As mentioned above, the studies included in the review give conflicting results. Hillen and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Hillen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillen 2011</LINK>) explored the wider literature around cancer patients' trust in their physician, and largely drew similar conclusions with respect to the lack of evidence for interventions that affected cancer patients' trust in their doctor. The authors called for more research exploring both the nature of trust and how the interaction between patient and physician affects that trust.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-27 14:21:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-02-15 22:46:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude that the interventions evaluated may increase or decrease trust in doctors and groups of doctors. The few experimental studies carried out to date have been inconclusive, methodologically weak or lack generalisability. In particular, trial work has almost exclusively taken place in North America, and transferability to other countries and cultures is unknown. However, this does not mean that trust is not an important part of the doctor-patient relationship and it has been shown to increase patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-02-27 14:21:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As most work has taken place in North America to date, further research is required to explore the applicability of definitions of trust and the validity of different measures of trust across different socio-cultural contexts and with different types of patients, such as those with life-long physical disabilities, mental health problems and learning difficulties. This should include robust mixed-method research.</P>
<P>With regard to changing doctor behaviour in a way that enhances trust, further research is required, firstly to compare the effectiveness of different training methods to improve physician behaviours which may enhance trust (such as humanistic or communication skills) or the use of a patient-centred or decision-sharing approach. Once effective methods have been established, these interventions should be tested as complex interventions in clinical trials. Trials should be large enough or take place in a variety of sites such that the effect on trust of different socio-cultural factors, including populations such as those with communication difficulties, and those long-term severe illness, may be tested. This could also include the evaluation of patients who are insured versus those uninsured.</P>
<P>Ideally such trials should include non-enthusiasts. Given the difficulty of engaging such individuals in research, however, an alternative is to make use of natural experiments where policy changes are intended to impact upon trust, and using an interrupted time series design to test the effects of such interventions. Studies should be of sufficient duration to allow trust to develop and allow changes over time to be studied.</P>
<P>The way we measure trust should be further investigated to ensure that we are measuring the right aspects of trust in different contexts and time-frames (<LINK REF="REF-Ozawa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozawa 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found qualitative and observational studies which demonstrated relationships between specific features of the consultation and trust (e.g. such as patient-centredness, the length of the consultation, continuity of care, how a doctor dresses). These features may have been amenable to an intervention study to determine the impact on trust and should be considered for future. (One small RCT on the impact of doctors' dress was excluded from the review because it did not use a validated measure of trust).</P>
<P>Additionally we highlight a need for trials to test the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The effect on trust of healthcare professionals making use of behaviours which demonstrate caring, for example personal telephone contact about test results and referrals, and attempting to resolve disputes between professional and patient, increasing patient centredness, lengthening the consultation;</LI>
<LI>The impact of education of patients on physician policy and practice, on use of guidelines (which may restrict patient choice), confidentiality, and error avoidance;</LI>
<LI>The impact on trust of management of medical errors including mis/under/over diagnosis;</LI>
<LI>The impact on trust of more intensive educational interventions for patients such as pulmonary or cardiac rehabilitation classes;</LI>
<LI>The effect on trust of allowing patients a wider choice of physician;</LI>
<LI>The effect on trust of increased continuity of care;</LI>
<LI>The effect on trust of lengthening the consultation;</LI>
<LI>The effect of doctors' dress (while this may seem superficial, unlike most interventions it is a relatively easy intervention to adopt);</LI>
<LI>The impact of any interventions to improve trust on outcomes associated with trust, such as adherence to medication and remaining with doctor/HMO;</LI>
<LI>The impact of interventions on the trust of third party carers who may assist communication with the doctor.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Finally, researchers generally should consider trust as an outcome when evaluating interventions where trust may be adversely affected.</P>

<P>Content of intervention: Revelation of physician incentives. Patients provided with two different disclosures of incentive payments to doctors tailored for health plan members of two different types of plan: a capitated plan (payment by capitation and mixed incentive bonus); and an open plan point of service (physicians paid by discounted fee for service and mixed incentive bonus). The disclosure contained information on the structure, direction and possible effects of the incentives in both plans (more versus less care). In the capitation plan intervention more emphasis was given to cost saving aspects of the plan. The description of the physician incentives emphasised more positive features (promoting health, eliminating unnecessary care). These were written in simple English and further reinforced by a subsequent phone call in which the details of the incentives of each plan were read out to subjects, their comprehension checked by a set of simple questions and any errors corrected and checked again.</P>

<P>Content of intervention:</P>
<P>
<U>Theoretical basis</U>: The authors propose that observational studies have suggested that information sharing by the clinician is associated with increased levels of trust. They therefore posit that as decision aids are tools, among other purposes, to help clinicians share unbiased evidence-based information and uncertainty with patients that their use should improve levels of trust.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention</U>; Patients with type 2 diabetes were referred to a subspecialty diabetes clinic to use the Statin Choice decision aid or a patient pamphlet about dyslipidaemia, and then to receive these materials from either the clinician during the visit or a researcher prior to the visit.</P>
<P>Design and main results of the trial published elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<U>Experimental Intervention</U>: Statin Choice decision aid*, a one-page document tailored to the individual patient including the patient's name, cardiovascular risk factors, and estimated cardiovascular risk. Benefits and downsides presented using natural frequencies and ordered ovals (e.g. after rows of green happy faces, red frowning faces denoted those, out of 100, who had undesirable events in 10 years of observation).</P>
<P>
<U>Definition of trust: </U>Trust is a fundamental feature of the patient-physician relationship that correlates with patient satisfaction, continuity of care, adherence to medical therapy, and other desirable practice metrics.</P>

<P>Key conclusion: Decisions aids do not significantly alter trust but may increase trust through improvements in the decision-making process and may enhance care.</P>
<P>Limitations to study: a small single-centre trial with trust as one of several secondary outcome measures. The mean trust score in the control group of 88.8, while high, was similar to previous experiences with the TPS. Responses were s into perfect and non-perfect scores to enhance interpretation. The authors recognised that scores for trust could be lower, and the effect of the decision aid different among minority patients (who reportedly may have greater distrust of physicians), and patients with established relationships with their clinician (these were all first visits). Authors state that the study did not have a sizable proportion of eligible minority participants, but they did adjust analyses for travel distance.</P>
<P>Strengths of study: rigorous design and conduct, and the planned and focused nature of the analyses.  Authors state that to their knowledge, this is the first use of trust as an outcome in a decision aid trial.</P>

<P>Authors' key conclusions: Trust is unharmed by disclosure and loyalty strengthened.</P>
<P>Comments:</P>
<P>Study performed in only 2 large medical groups and generalisability to smaller groups or to patients in other settings remains unclear. Response rates to the surveys were low; possible that higher response rates could have revealed a diminished influence of the disclosures on key outcomes.</P>
<P>The disclosure letters, while having a positive effect on understanding overall, left many patients unable to identify the basic method through which their physicians were compensated. Even among patients who remembered receiving a disclosure, more than 50% did not feel like they knew enough to be able to judge the possible influence of their physician&#8217;s compensation on their health care. The study also showed that there were still many patients in Boston and Los Angeles who mistakenly believed their physicians were being paid through capitation or a bonus tied to year-end financial performance.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis: The main analyses of the study were framed to measure the effectiveness of the disclosures by comparing all patients who were sent the disclosures (intervention) with those who were not sent the disclosures (control). Parallel analyses to evaluate the maximal impact of the disclosure statements were performed comparing control patients with patients who were sent a disclosure and indicated that they remembered receiving it. Comparisons of the responders and non-responders to the survey based on T<I> </I>tests and Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests.  All other tests are Waldtype tests based on generalised estimating equations, which were used to control for clustering among patients sharing a PCP. Given the differences in disclosure letters and site population characteristics, analyses were stratified by site. Power calculations were not given. Potential for unit of analysis error for some outcomes: Univariate P values are from generalised estimating equations adjusted only for clustering by PCP. All other results described as &#8220;adjusted&#8221; in the text derive from multivariable generalised estimating equations, including variables for age, sex, race, education, and self-reported health. </P>

<P>Content of intervention:</P>
<P>
<U>Basis</U>: Health disparities in the US and between European Americans and other racial/ethnic groups have been amply documented. Increasing the cultural competency of physicians and other healthcare providers has been suggested as one mechanism for reducing such disparities by improving the quality of care across racial/ethnic groups. The Federal Office of Minority Health has published guidelines that include cultural competency training for healthcare providers and the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education has made cultural sensitivity a part of professional competency for physicians in training.</P>
<P>
<U>In the Study</U>: Patients completed a baseline survey which included a measure of physician culturally-competent behaviours. Cultural competency training was then provided to physicians at two of the sites.</P>
<P>
<U>Cultural competency training:</U> Training was divided into three modules corresponding to the three areas in the cultural-competency model. Modules could then be given either as a single half-day training session or as three separate sessions lasting 1 to 1.5 hours each. While there was a focus on patients with diabetes or hypertension, most of the content was designed to be applied to patients in general. Teaching techniques included didactic presentations, group discussion, role-playing with learners critique, group exercises, use of trigger tapes, and handouts. Instructors included the authors, two other physicians with expertise in cross-cultural care, and experts in training and use of interpreters. The concept of a cultural competency continuum was used across all three modules to emphasise working toward a goal of increasing cultural versatility, defined as "having a variety of skills to bridge to patients from different cultural backgrounds". Post-training, learners were asked to rate the usefulness of the training they received on a 5-point Likert-type scale and overall educational content, relevance to practice, and reported that the training had increased their awareness of patients' cultural beliefs, and increased their communication skills with patients as mean scores.</P>
<P>
<U>Patients' feedback:</U> Questionnaires were administered and returned by mail except for participants who asked to complete the questionnaire by phone. Participating patients were paid $10 for returning the baseline questionnaire, and $5 for each follow-up questionnaire. Follow-up questionnaires were sent two times.</P>
<P>Feedback was provided to each physician via written report with an interpretation of the aggregated patient-reported physician cultural competence scores from their patients. In addition to an overall score, scores were provided for each of the three areas: history taking, explaining, and partnering. Scores for each individual item were reported as well. Aggregated mean scores for other physicians within their practice group were provided for comparison. A cover letter accompanying the feedback offered interpretation of the scores and suggested behaviours that could help to improve scores. The physician was offered the opportunity to discuss one-on one the feedback results.</P>

<P>Clinical setting: HMO, USA.</P>
<P>Characteristics of patients: New enrollees (last 18 months) in a HMO, who did not have a designated physician. Of those offered, 75% (117/156) agreed an individual visit with a doctor alone and of these 57% (67/117) attended; 74% (131/177) agreed a visit with a doctor and educator and 58% (76/131) of those attended; 50% (264/528) agreed a group visit and 54% (143/264) of those attended. Therefore, data were available for 286 patients randomised to 3 intervention groups. Additionally, 278 patients were randomised to a control group. Young men were least likely to schedule a visit (40%) and older adults most likely (73%). Participants were 58% female, aged between 20 and 80, 72% white, 10% black, 10% Hispanic and 9% Asian. Most (more than 60%) were in self-assessed good or excellent health. 'Refusers' and those who did not attend had similar baseline characteristics to participants.</P>
<P>Numbers of patients followed up in intervention group: 67 (doctor visit), 76 (doctor + health educator), 143 (Group visit). </P>
<P>Numbers of patients followed up in control group: 278.</P>
<P>Characteristics of intervention provider: The doctor-only intervention was carried out by 20 doctors from the HMO. These doctors had a 1-hour orientation to the tools and goals of the visits. The doctor plus health educator intervention included doctors from the HMO as above with whom the patient was usually subsequently empanelled. The health educators were a registered nurse and two Health Educators (no specific training was mentioned for these). The physician and health educators who led the final intervention groups had received one day's training on the curriculum and videotaped feedback to improve their presentation and facilitation styles. These patients were eventually empanelled with other doctors. <BR/>

<P>Content of intervention: Compared the impact of three different types of induction visit for new patients of an HMO against no intervention. The interventions were: individual visit with a physician; physician visit followed by a visit with a health educator, or a group visit of eight new members led by a physician and a health educator. Each included a brief Health Risk Appraisal, review with a clinician and referral for appropriate screening and immunisations. The visit with the doctor lasted 15 minutes. The doctors offering this intervention had taken part in one hour's training on the tools and goals of the visits. The doctor and health educator visits provided an additional 15-minute visit with the health educator after seeing the doctor. This visit included discussion of lifestyle issues and creation of a 'personalised prevention plan' and also a review of the contents of a Healthwise handbook which all members received in the post (a booklet which contains lifestyle advice, and advice about self management of medical problems). The third intervention comprised six age- and gender-specific 'Group Visits' which followed a semi-structured curriculum on the Heathwise handbook, training on making the most of medical visits including shared decision making, and age- and gender-specific advice on important screening, immunisations, and lifestyle.</P>
<P>Duration and timing: 15 minutes (doctor alone); 15 minutes with doctor and 15 minutes with health educator; 90 minute group visit.</P>
