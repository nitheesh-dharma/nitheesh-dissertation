<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The former review was integrated with data from both haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke patients, in order to evaluate the efficacy of glycerol on all strokes. Three further studies were added: Albizzati (1979), Azzimondi (personal communication) and Yu (1992). In one study (Mathew 1972) haemorrhagic patients were considered as well. For consistency, the same criteria were applied to all studies in the same way. Two reviewers blindly checked both the old and the new studies for eligibility and quality and repeated the data extraction. Any disagreement was discussed among all the co-workers. The study by Gelmers (1975) was also not included in this second review but, unlike previously, was excluded owing to its inadequate method of randomisation. The study by Gagliardi (1991) was not included and is awaiting further assessment, because randomisation and inclusion and exclusion criteria were not clear. Some new analyses were added:<BR/>(1) subgroup analysis between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke;<BR/>(2) sensitivity analysis to truly randomised trials.<BR/>The study by Albizzati (1979) was included because it was unconfounded but analysis was further repeated without this study to evaluate any possible interaction between dexamethasone and glycerol.</P>
<P>For this update (2003) a new trial has been identified (Kario 1995), but it has been excluded because it did not meet our inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>There is not enough evidence to show if glycerol can reduce the disabling effects of brain swelling due to acute stroke. Brain swelling (or oedema) is a major cause of early death and long-term disability after stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds). A 10% solution of glycerol might reduce brain swelling and therefore reduce the risk of death and long-term disability after a stroke. The review found some evidence that glycerol improves the short term survival after stroke, but there was not enough evidence to decide whether glycerol helps avoid disability after stroke. Adverse effects of glycerol treatment did not happen often, but a small number of treated patients were found to have blood in their urine (this disappeared after the glycerol treatment was stopped). More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Brain oedema is a major cause of early death after stroke. A 10% solution of glycerol is a hyperosmolar agent that is claimed to reduce brain oedema. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-21 14:58:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine whether intravenous glycerol treatment in acute stroke, either ischaemic or haemorrhagic, influences death rates and functional outcome in the short or long term, and whether the treatment is safe.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Stroke Group trials register was searched (January 2003), and some trialists were personally contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-21 14:59:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>All completed, randomised and quasi-randomised, controlled, published and unpublished comparisons, evaluating clinical outcome in which intravenous glycerol treatment was initiated within the first days after stroke onset.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-21 14:59:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data and this was checked with all co-reviewers. Death from all causes, functional outcome, and adverse effects were analysed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:00:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Eleven completed, randomised trials comparing intravenous glycerol and control were considered. Analysis of death during the scheduled treatment period for acute ischaemic and/or haemorrhagic stroke was possible in 10 trials where 482 glycerol treated patients were compared with 463 control patients. Glycerol was associated with a non-significant reduction in the odds of death within the scheduled treatment period (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.58 to 1.06). Among patients with definite or probable ischaemic stroke, glycerol was associated with a significant reduction in the odds of death during the scheduled treatment period (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97). However, at the end of the scheduled follow-up period, there was no significant difference in the odds of death (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31). Functional outcome was reported in only two studies but there were non-significantly more patients who had a good outcome at the end of scheduled follow up (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.42). Haemolysis seems to be the only relevant adverse effect of glycerol treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This systematic review suggests a favourable effect of glycerol treatment on short term survival in patients with probable or definite ischaemic stroke but the confidence intervals were wide and the magnitude of the treatment effect may be only minimal. Due to the relatively small number of patients, and that the trials were performed in the pre-CT era, the results must be interpreted cautiously. The lack of evidence of benefit in long term survival does not support the routine or selective use of glycerol treatment in patients with acute stroke.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:05:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:02:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The 30-day case fatality rate in prospective, community-based studies of patients with first ever ischaemic stroke is 10% and with first ever haemorrhagic stroke about 52% (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 1990</LINK>). Patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke are also at high risk of dying, the observed one-month case fatality rate in trials with placebo treatment varies from 21% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-a_x0027_-Rogvi_x002d_Hansen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">a' Rogvi-Hansen 1992</LINK>). Stroke-related oedema is maximal two to four days after stroke onset and is a major cause of early neurological deterioration and death (<LINK REF="REF-Toni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toni 1995</LINK>). Glycerol is a hyperosmolar agent that is claimed to reduce infarct-related oedema without rebound effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cantore-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantore 1964</LINK>), to increase cerebral blood flow, and to improve cerebral metabolism by recoupling the uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in the ischaemic brain tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1975</LINK>). Side effects of the treatment seem to be negligible (<LINK REF="REF-a_x0027_-Rogvi_x002d_Hansen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">a' Rogvi-Hansen 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>A striking difference in the use of anti-oedema osmotic agents (OA) among the 36 countries which participated in the International Stroke Trial (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>) has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Ricci-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricci 1998</LINK>). Subgroup analyses of the main study for Italian patients showed that OA, mainly glycerol, had been given to a high proportion of patients: 48.3% (95% CI 46.6 to 50) of 3437 Italian patients (in 77 centres) compared to 29.6% (95% CI 26.4 to 32.9) of 759 patients in Poland, and less than 2% in the vast majority of the other countries where the remaining 15,239 patients were included. It was suggested that OA treatment did not change the prognosis, or even had a negative prognostic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Righetti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Righetti 1994</LINK>). The differences in the therapeutical approach reflect a substantial uncertainty in the clinical use of such an inexpensive and apparently safe drug in severe stroke patients.</P>
<P>In this updated review, data from haemorrhagic stroke patients were included since in the old studies, run in pre-CT era, definite diagnosis of ischaemic stroke was not possible and moreover it enables the efficacy of glycerol on both pathological subtypes of stroke to be evaluated.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:04:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of early intravenous (I.V.) administration of glycerol in acute stroke. The review wishes to test the following hypotheses:<BR/>(1) I.V. glycerol is effective in reducing case fatality in the acute phase of stroke;<BR/>(2) I.V. glycerol is effective in reducing case fatality some months after stroke;<BR/>(3) I.V. glycerol reduces the proportion of patients dead or dependent in activities of daily living some months after stroke;<BR/>(4) I.V. glycerol treatment is safe.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:04:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All completed, randomised and quasi-randomised, controlled, unconfounded, published and unpublished comparisons evaluating the clinical outcome of I.V. glycerol treatment initiated within the first two days from stroke onset were included. In only one study was glycerol treatment initiated within the first four days.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The participants in the trials suffered from definite or presumed ischaemic strokes and/or definite haemorrhagic strokes. Cases of presumed ischaemic stroke reflect the fact that the majority of the studies were done before access to CT scanning was routine. However, efforts were made in each trial to differentiate intracranial haemorrhage by lumbar puncture or arteriography. Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage were excluded from the analyses.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies comparing glycerol treatment to a control group in the acute period of the stroke were included.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:04:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The outcome measures were:<BR/>(1) the number of deaths in each group, from whatever cause, during the scheduled treatment period;<BR/>(2) the number of deaths in each group, from whatever cause, by the end of trial follow up (within six months of the stroke onset);<BR/>(3) disability evaluated among survivors by modified Rankin Scale of 3 to 5 or by Barthel Index of &lt; 19/20, or comparable scales of activity of daily living by the end of trial follow up (within six months of the stroke onset);<BR/>(4) poor prognosis in each group, by the end of trial follow up considered as death or disability;<BR/>(5) any registered adverse effect of the treatment according to the definitions given by the authors of each studies.</P>
<P>Wherever possible, results were determined by intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<P>See: 'Specialized register' section in <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/STROKE/frame.html">Cochrane Stroke Group</A>
</P>
<P>Relevant trials were identified in the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register. The register was last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator for this review in January 2003. Further information was obtained from personal contact with some authors.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Each trial was evaluated by two reviewers independently and a structured methodology and data collection form was completed for trials selected for inclusion. For trials reported in a language other than English, the form was sent by the Cochrane Stroke Group to a person familiar with the language for data extraction. Any disagreement between the two reviewers was cross-checked and solved by discussion among all the reviewers either by formal meeting or by electronic mail. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of each trial has not been assessed by any scoring system, but the following details were noted: randomisation and type of allocation concealment, patient and assessor blinding, data evaluated with intention to treat analysis, number of patients who withdrew from treatment and/or were lost to follow up. The primary analysis included all trials independently of the method of randomisation, allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis. </P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the overall results of all trials with those of the truly randomised trials. As glycerol might have a different level of efficacy in patients with ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, or in patients with different levels of consciousness, specified subgroups had been identified as definite haemorrhagic stroke and probable and definite ischaemic stroke. </P>
<P>Unconfounded trials comparing glycerol with control were subdivided by whether or not background anti-oedema treatment (e.g. dexamethasone) had been given to both groups or not.</P>
<P>The statistical analysis was performed using a standard fixed-effects model as described by Yusuf and Peto (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>).</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>See 'Characteristics of Included Studies'. Eleven of the 17 trials identified fulfilled the entry criteria. Three trials compared glycerol in saline versus saline, two trials compared glycerol with saline/glucose versus saline/glucose, one trial compared glycerol in a non-specified solution versus saline/glucose, one trial compared glycerol in glucose versus saline, one trial compared glycerol in 5% glucose versus 10% glucose, and one trial compared glycerol plus dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone. One trial with glycerol in saline/glucose and one trial with glycerol in a non-specified solution did not have a placebo group.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>(1) Randomisation - all the trials included were randomised.<BR/>(2) Type of allocation concealment - in six trials allocation concealment was adequate (level A); in four trials there was uncertainty (level B); one trial was inadequate (level C).<BR/>(3) Patient and assessor blinding - in three trials placebo was not used, in one case the assessment was blind.<BR/>(4) Intention to treat analysis - eight trials were evaluated according to an intention to treat analysis.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Analysis of death within the scheduled treatment period for acute ischaemic and/or haemorrhagic stroke was possible in 10 trials where 482 glycerol-treated patients were compared to 463 control patients. Glycerol was associated with a non-significant reduction in odds of death (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.78), with wide confidence intervals (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0.58 to 1.06). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (chi square = 11.89; df = 9; p = 0.25). </P>
<P>Excluding the trial using dexamethasone in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Albizzati-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Albizzati 1979</LINK>), given the possible negative interaction of the combination of glycerol with this drug, the results became marginally significant (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00). Sensitivity analysis including only truly randomised trials with adequate concealment did not substantially alter the result (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00). There is no evidence that the treatment effect of glycerol is different in patients with definite or probable ischaemic stroke and patients with haemorrhagic stroke (p = 0.4). Among patients randomised with definite or probably ischaemic stroke, glycerol was associated with a significant reduction in the odds of death during the scheduled treatment period (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97). </P>
<P>Analysis of the effects of glycerol on death at the end of scheduled follow up was possible in eight trials where 412 glycerol treated patients were compared to 389 control patients. There was no evidence of any effect of glycerol on this outcome (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31). Excluding the trial using dexamethasone in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Albizzati-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Albizzati 1979</LINK>), the results did not change (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30) similarly, the results were unaltered after sensitivity analysis including only truly randomised trials with adequate concealment (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24) and in subgroup analyses of only definite or probable ischaemic stroke patients (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.24). Death at the end of scheduled follow up was not analysed in haemorrhagic stroke patients as only one relatively small study was available.</P>
<P>Although many trials reported some results of functional outcome using disability scales, the functional outcome was comparable only in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Azzimondi" TYPE="STUDY">Azzimondi</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bayer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bayer 1987</LINK>), using data analysable as dichotomous variables (modified Rankin Scale). Glycerol was associated with a non-significant reduction in the odds of being dead or dependent at the end of scheduled follow up (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.42) but these comparisons must be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of patients (127 versus 107).</P>
<P>Side effects of the active treatment were considered in six trials and not reported in five. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Azzimondi" TYPE="STUDY">Azzimondi</LINK>) reported macro haematuria among 15 of 44 (34%) patients in the treated group (7/20 in low dose group and 8/24 in high dose group) and only one case of heart failure in the high dose group. No adverse events were reported in the control group. Fawer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Fawer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Fawer 1978</LINK>) reported a mean 5 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure during glycerol infusion. No changes were registered in the control group. Frei et al (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 1987</LINK>) found biochemical, subclinical signs of haemolysis in 98% of the glycerol treated patients with a mean drop of 1.7 g% in haemoglobin during the trial for both glycerol and glycerol plus dextran treated patients. No adverse effects were reported in the control group. Friedli et al (<LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1979</LINK>) did not find adverse effects. Yu (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1992</LINK>) observed gross haemoglobinuria leading to discontinuation of the glycerol among 9 of 107 treated patients (8%) and 2 of 109 of control patients (1.8%) (OR 4.9, 95% CI 0.98 to 47.5), whereas Yu (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1993</LINK>) found haemoglobinuria among 8 of 56 (14.3%) treated patients, but in none of the 57 controls . </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:05:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The number of identified trials of glycerol treatment for acute stroke and the total number of patients included were low. The method of randomisation and concealment were adequate in less than half of the trials.</P>
<P>Few patients had their stroke confirmed by CT-scan, and therefore the diagnosis of haemorrhagic and of ischaemic stroke was not reliable in most of the studies. Furthermore, lacunar stroke patients (by definition a group at negligible risk of cerebral oedema) were overtly excluded only in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Azzimondi" TYPE="STUDY">Azzimondi</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Fawer 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1993</LINK>) but their clinical definition of lacunar stroke was not reported. In only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Azzimondi" TYPE="STUDY">Azzimondi</LINK>) was the clinical suspicion of cerebral oedema considered in the list of inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>In six of the trials, glucose was used as control, which may not be completely inert. In one study all patients were treated with steroids. To verify any possible interference of dexamethasone treatment we repeated the analysis without this study, but the results remained the same.</P>
<P>The results of the statistical review must be interpreted with circumspection. The analysis of the review indicated a decrease in case fatality rate in the acute phase of the disease. This effect was statistically significant when only patients with probable or definite ischaemic stroke were considered.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the only trial with a statistically significant favourable effect on death within the scheduled treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Bayer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bayer 1987</LINK>) did not undertake an intention-to-treat analysis (which might well have given a less promising result).</P>
<P>There was no apparent benefit from glycerol among definite haemorrhagic stroke patients, but the low number of cases does not allow for reliable conclusions.</P>
<P>Case fatality at the end of scheduled follow-up was virtually the same in the two groups. There were not enough data to evaluate the effect of glycerol on long-term disability. Thus, the implication that glycerol only delays death at the cost of increasing disability cannot be rejected.

<BR/>The only side effect reported in a small proportion of patients in the group treated with glycerol was haematuria, though this effect was not explicitly registered in all studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review suggests that glycerol treatment has an effect on short-term survival in a subgroup of patients with probable or definite ischaemic stroke. Because of the relatively small number of patients and the fact that most of the trials were performed in the pre-CT era, the results must be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, most patients included in the studies did not have impairment of consciousness. The lack of statistical significance of the long term effect does not support the wide use of glycerol treatment in acute stroke. Moreover, this review does not provide reliable evidence on the efficacy of the glycerol treatment in patients with established cerebral oedema. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-21 15:05:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Glycerol treatment is inexpensive and appears to be safe. This review suggests that it may be associated with the reduction in the number of patients dying within the first few days of stroke onset but it was not possible to rule out a negative effect on long-term disability. The treatment should therefore now be tested in a much larger scale randomised controlled trial comparing glycerol with non glycerol treatment, perhaps restricted to patients who have clinical evidence of cerebral oedema, in which the long term effects of treatment on disability, handicap and quality of life are reliably assessed.</P>
