<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:58:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Epidural analgesia may give good pain relief after hip or knee replacement surgery, but this benefit must be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects and complications. Hip and knee replacements are common operations to improve mobility and quality of life. After surgery, good pain relief is essential to enable patients to start walking again. Epidurals (pain medicine injected into the spinal canal) are commonly used. However, this pain relief method may delay the start of blood thinners, which prevent life-threatening blood clot formation (thrombosis) in veins, because there is also a risk of bleeding at the epidural injection site if blood thinners are used at the same time. This review found that an epidural comprising local anaesthetic with or without a strong opioid might give better pain relief than an epidural with only strong opioids; the benefit may be felt only in the first four to six hours after surgery. Aside from pain relief, there was insufficient information to draw conclusions on other benefits or harms arising from epidural analgesia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:54:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Hip and knee replacement are common operative procedures to improve mobility and quality of life. Adequate pain relief is essential in the postoperative period to enable ambulation and initiation of physiotherapy. Lumbar epidural analgesia is a common modality for pain relief following these procedures. As the use of epidural analgesia may delay the initiation of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis due to the potential risk of epidural hematoma, a synthesis of the evidence is necessary to determine whether or not alternative analgesic modalities are worse, equivalent, or better than epidural analgesia.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:55:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Is lumbar epidural analgesia more efficacious than systemic analgesia or long-acting spinal analgesia for postoperative pain relief in patients after elective hip or knee replacement?</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:55:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the CENTRAL were searched from their inception to June 2001.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:55:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>A study was included if it was a randomized or pseudo randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of patients undergoing hip or knee replacement, in which postoperative lumbar epidural analgesia was compared to other methods for pain relief. Study selection was performed unblinded in duplicate.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:56:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Data were collected unblinded in duplicate. Information on patients, methods, interventions, outcomes (pain relief, postoperative function, length of stay) and adverse events were recorded. Methodological quality was assessed using a validated 5-point scale. Meta-analysis was conducted when sufficient data existed from two or more studies. Heterogeneity testing was performed using the Breslow-Day method. The fixed-effect model was used unless heterogeneity was present, in which case, a random-effects model was used. Continuous data were summarized as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Dichotomous data were summarized as odds ratios (OR) and numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) or numbers-needed-to-treat-to-harm (NNH) with their respective 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In the first four to six hours after surgery, patients receiving epidural analgesia had less pain at rest, based on visual analog scores (VAS), than patients receiving systemic analgesia (SMD -0.77; 95% CI -1.24 to -0.31). This effect was not statistically significant by 18 to 24 hours (SMD -0.29; 95% CI -0.73 to 0.16). These observations were based only on studies evaluating populations consisting of total knee replacements alone or mixed populations of total hip or total knee replacements. For pain relief with movement after surgery, patients receiving epidural analgesia reported lower pain scores than patients receiving systemic analgesia in all four studies examining these outcomes. The choice of epidural agents may also influence the extent to which epidural analgesia differs from systemic analgesia. The differences between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia in the frequency of nausea and vomiting (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.49) or depression of breathing (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.54) were not statistically significant. Sedation occurred less frequently with epidural analgesia (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97) with a number-needed-to-harm of 7.7 (95% CI 3.5 to 42.0) patients for the systemic analgesia group. Retention of urine (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.51; NNH 4.5, 95% CI 2.3 to 12.2), itching (OR 4.74, 95% CI 1.76 to 12.78; NNH 6.8, 95% CI 4.4 to 15.8), and low blood pressure (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.72; NNH 6.7, 95% CI 3.5 to 103) were more frequent with epidural analgesia compared to systemic analgesia. There were insufficient numbers to draw conclusions on the effect of epidural analgesia on serious postoperative complications, functional outcomes, or length of hospital stay.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-09 13:27:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>Epidural analgesia may be useful for postoperative pain relief following major lower limb joint replacements. However, the benefits may be limited to the early (four to six hours) postoperative period. An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic-narcotic mixture may be better than epidural narcotic alone. The magnitude of pain relief must be weighed against the frequency of adverse events. The current evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the frequency of rare complications from epidural analgesia, postoperative morbidity or mortality, functional outcomes, or length of hospital stay.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 11:07:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:58:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Hip and knee replacement are common operative procedures that relieve pain and improve mobility and quality of life in individuals with various rheumatological conditions, especially osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1990</LINK>). Adequate pain relief is essential in the immediate postoperative period to enable the patient to undertake physiotherapy that will facilitate movement of the joints and tissues. Inadequate pain relief may, therefore, prevent early mobility and delay discharge from hospital.</P>
<P>Lumbar epidural analgesia is a common modality for pain relief following hip or knee replacement. Some physicians assert that epidural analgesia provides better pain relief than other postoperative analgesic modalities. However, no systematic review of the evidence to support or refute this impression has been performed.</P>
<P>A synthesis of this information is urgently needed due to the potential implications of co-administered epidural analgesia and anticoagulant prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement. In the absence of anticoagulant prophylaxis, hip or knee replacements are associated with 40 to 70% risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 1 to 2% risk of fatal pulmonary embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Clagett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clagett 1998</LINK>). On the other hand, co-administered anticoagulant prophylaxis and epidural analgesia is associated with an increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma, a devastating complication that can result in permanent neurological impairment even after prompt neurosurgical decompression (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1995</LINK>). In the past, unfractionated heparin was used for thromboprophylaxis in this population. Evidence from large, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) indicates that low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are more efficacious than unfractionated heparin after hip arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Planes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Planes 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Levine-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leyvraz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyvraz 1991</LINK>) and more effective than warfarin after knee arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 1996</LINK>). Consequently, LMWH is the anticoagulant prophylaxis of choice in patients undergoing lower limb joint replacement. However, in recent years, there have been over 50 reports of spinal epidural hematoma occurring in association with LMWH use in patients receiving spinal anesthesia or epidural analgesia. The absolute risk of epidural hematoma with co-administered LMWH and epidural analgesia is not known but may be as high as 1 in 3200 or as low as 1 in 150,000 cases (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ideally, the start of LMWH should be delayed until an epidural catheter is removed. However, clinicians may be concerned about the risk of DVT if LMWH prophylaxis is delayed for two to three days after surgery because of coincident epidural analgesia. On the other hand, avoiding epidural analgesia to allow early initiation of LMWH prophylaxis may result in suboptimal joint movement and pain control. If alternative methods of pain control, which avoid the risk of epidural hematoma, are as efficacious as epidural analgesia, then these alternatives would help to resolve the management of patients who require effective thromboprophylaxis and pain relief after hip or knee replacement surgery.</P>
<P>Against this background, we critically reviewed the evidence regarding the efficacy of epidural analgesia compared to other analgesic modalities for postoperative pain relief following hip and knee replacement surgery.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our objective is to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of epidural analgesia for postoperative pain control following hip or knee replacement surgery based on the evidence from controlled clinical trials. In particular, we wish to answer the primary question: "Is lumbar epidural analgesia more efficacious than systemic analgesia or long-acting intrathecal (spinal) analgesia for postoperative pain relief in patients after hip or knee replacement?"</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-29 11:02:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:58:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Included studies were prospective, controlled clinical trials in which allocation was achieved in a randomized or pseudo-randomized (health card number or sequential alternation) manner. Given the nature of our comparators, we expected that some trials would not be blinded for ethical reasons. These trials were included. Concurrent cohort studies and observational studies were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The study population consisted of patients of any age, who underwent elective hip or knee replacement surgery. The procedure could be either a primary (first time) replacement, or removal of initial hardware and secondary (repeat) replacement. </P>
<P>Emergency joint replacements or joint replacements for treatment of acute fractures were excluded. </P>
<P>In trials where both unilateral and bilateral procedures or hip and knee replacements were included, attempts were made to conduct subgroup analyses according to number and type of joint replaced. We anticipated that there would be trials with insufficient details to permit stratification; these studies were included and evaluated separately.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-29 10:58:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Included studies had at least one arm in which epidural agents were used to provide postoperative pain relief after lower limb joint replacement surgery. Epidural agents were included if they were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>long acting agents (for example, morphine) given in the intraoperative period, or</LI>
<LI>agents given as boluses or infusions in the postoperative period.</LI>
</UL>
<P>As our intent was to compare clinically relevant modalities of analgesia, acceptable comparators were systemic (intravenous or intramuscular) analgesics administered in the postoperative period or long-acting intrathecal analgesics administered in the intraoperative period.</P>
<P>We anticipated that patients may have received other analgesics as co-interventions. (Co-interventions are described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). However, we expected heterogeneity in the use of other analgesics between studies due to the uncontrolled nature of these co-interventions. Studies were not excluded because of the co-interventions administered, and adjustment for these co-interventions was not made in our analysis.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Our efficacy analysis was based on the extent to which pain is relieved. Whenever possible, our inferences on this outcome were based on pain measurements using the visual analog score (VAS) to obtain a continuous variable. When trials did not use the VAS but utilized a discrete pain measurement, conversion to a dichotomous variable with 50% pain reduction was performed and inferences were made based on this variable.</P>
<P>For analysis of effectiveness, we evaluated functional outcomes, side effects, and length of hospital stay. All measurements of functional status were recorded as we anticipated that functional outcome measures would be heterogeneous between trials; however, we preferred to analyze measurements based on validated, prospective scales. The incidences of cognitive, neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal adverse events were recorded if relevant data were available from the trials. Adverse events were included if they occurred during the time period in which the intervention occurred. The frequencies of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were assessed if relevant data were available. The length of hospital stay was also recorded.</P>

<P>The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) were searched from their inception to June 2001 using the strategies listed below. The reference lists of selected studies and review articles were reviewed for additional citations. No language restrictions were applied. Unpublished studies were not sought.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Eligibility</HEADING>
<P>Review authors were not blinded to authors, institutions, journal of publication, or study results. Two review authors (MB, PC) independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of trials identified in the literature search for their eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction </HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted from included trials by two independent review authors (JD, JS). Disagreements were resolved through a third review author (PC). Information on the patients, methods, interventions, outcomes (pain relief, postoperative function, length of stay) and adverse events were recorded. Authors were not contacted for missing information or unpublished data.</P>
<P>For continuous data with a normal distribution (e.g. VAS), the mean value ± standard deviation for each group was derived (if necessary) and recorded for each study arm. For continuous data without a normal distribution (e.g. length of stay data), median values and range were recorded for each study arm if possible. Data that did not permit extraction (or derivation) of the median value were excluded from analysis.</P>
<P>Only functional outcome scores based on prospective validated scales were used for analysis. As different trials were likely to use different scales, data from functional outcome scores were converted to dichotomous outcomes with the cut-off point dependent on the value representing a clinically significant change for each individual scale.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, such as adverse events, absolute numbers were expressed as fractions (for example, four patients with outcome of interest /ten patients in study arm) to permit calculations of absolute risk reductions (ARR) and numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) or numbers-needed-to-treat-to-harm (NNH). If the dichotomous outcomes were expressed as a proportion, the data were converted into the original fraction. If dichotomous data were expressed in an ordinal manner (e.g. 0 to 25% / 26 to 50%/51 to 75%/76 to 100%), attempts were made to convert this information into a dichotomous form that would represent a threshold for a clinically significant outcome. If this was not possible, the categorical data were excluded from analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality </HEADING>
<P>The internal validity of the included trials was evaluated by two reviewers (JD, JS) using the 5-point scale devised by Jadad et al (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Possible scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher methodological quality. Allocation concealment was rated as adequate (A), unclear (B), or inadequate (C).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summarizing the results</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis was conducted when sufficient data existed from two or more studies. Heterogeneity testing was performed using the Breslow-Day method (<LINK REF="REF-Breslow-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breslow 1980</LINK>). The fixed-effect model was used unless heterogeneity was present, in which case, the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) was used. For continuous data with normal distributions, the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used if studies used an identical measurement scale (e.g. all studies used a 100 mm VAS) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI was used if studies used different measurement scales (e.g. some studies used a 50 mm VAS and other studies used a 100 mm VAS). Dichotomous data were summarized as odds ratios (OR) and NNT or NNH with their respective 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of methodological quality (randomized versus pseudo randomized), type of joint (hip versus knee), and type of medication in the epidural (local anesthetics versus opioids versus combined local anesthetics-opioids versus other agents).</P>

Inter-rater reliability for the study selection was 0.46.</P>
<P>The thirteen included studies varied extensively in the intraoperative co-interventions. Spinal anaesthesia, epidural anaesthesia, general anaesthesia, and epigeneral anaesthesia was used for all groups in three, two, one, and two studies respectively. Three studies compared epidural anaesthesia and analgesia with general anaesthesia and systemic analgesia. Two studies compared epigeneral anaesthesia and epidural analgesia with general anaesthesia and systemic analgesia.</P>
<P>Four studies evaluated patients undergoing total hip replacement, six studies evaluated patients undergoing total knee replacement, and three studies evaluated patients undergoing either types of joint replacement.</P>
<P>The timing of measurements varied between one hour after surgery to seven days after surgery for pain VAS scores, which were measured in 11 studies. Two studies reported baseline preoperative pain scores; one study reported baseline postoperative pain scores. Thirteen studies reported adverse events. Three studies evaluated functional outcomes. Five studies reported lengths of stay.</P>
<P>The details of the included studies are described in the "<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>" table. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> in the Additional Tables section categorize the studies by type of intraoperative anaesthetic received and the type of epidural agents given for epidural analgesia.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In general, the methodological quality of the included studies was poor. Although all studies stated that patients were randomized, only five studies reported the method of randomization. Five studies reported double-blinding, but only one study reported the method. In two other studies in which double-blinding was reported, patients in the systemic analgesia groups did not receive placebo epidural catheters; thus, the likelihood of differentiating patients in epidural versus systemic analgesia groups was high. Seven studies reported the number of withdrawals. The Jadad score ranged from one to four with a median score of two. Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hommeril-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hommeril 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Klasen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klasen 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sharrock-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sharrock 1994</LINK>) were considered of high methodological quality (Jadad score of three or greater). In general, for any given outcome, there were too few studies of high methodological quality to perform sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality.</P>

<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moiniche-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moiniche 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bertini-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bertini 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singelyn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singelyn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wulf-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wulf 1999</LINK>) reported dynamic pain scores; only one (<LINK REF="STD-Singelyn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singelyn 1998</LINK>) reported scores as means with standard deviations. Thus, results were pooled only for early (four to six hours) and late (18 to 24 hours) postoperative pain relief at rest. Because studies used different ranges for the VAS scores, the standardized mean difference was used to summarize the treatment effect.</P>
<P>For early postoperative pain relief at rest, epidural analgesia appears to be superior to systemic analgesia (SMD -0.77; 95% CI -1.24 to -0.31). This effect is not statistically significant by 18 to 24 hours (SMD -0.29; 95% CI -0.73 to 0.16). These observations are based only on studies evaluating populations consisting of total knee replacements alone or mixed populations of total hip or total knee replacements.</P>
<P>The choice of epidural agents may also influence the extent to which epidural analgesia differs from systemic analgesia. Two (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klasen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klasen 1999</LINK>) of five studies that compared epidural narcotics to systemic analgesics found lower VAS scores in the systemic analgesic groups. No study that compared epidural local anaesthetic alone or local anaesthetic-narcotic mixtures to systemic analgesics found lower VAS scores in the systemic analgesic groups.</P>
<P>For both early and late postoperative pain relief during leg movement or ambulation, patients receiving epidural analgesia reported lower VAS scores than patients receiving systemic analgesia in all four studies examining these outcomes. None of these studies used epidural narcotics alone. A quantitative estimate of the treatment effect could not be calculated due to the variations in reporting of VAS scores.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Nausea and vomiting, sedation, urinary retention, pruritis, respiratory depression, and hypotension were reported in a number of studies. The data are summarized in the 'Comparisons and Data' section of this review (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> Nausea and Vomiting; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> Sedation; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> Urinary Retention; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> Pruritis; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK> Respiratory Depression; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>Hypotension).</P>
<P>The differences between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia in the frequency of nausea and vomiting (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.49) or respiratory depression (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.54) were not statistically significant. Sedation occurred less frequently with epidural analgesia (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97) with a number-needed-to-harm of 7.7 (95% CI 3.5 to 42.0) patients for the systemic analgesic group. Urinary retention (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.51; NNH 4.5, 95% CI 2.3 to 12.2), pruritis (OR 4.74, 95% CI 1.76 to 12.78; NNH 6.8; 95% CI 4.4 to 15.8), and hypotension (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.72; NNH 6.7, 95% CI 3.5 to 103) were more frequent with epidural analgesia compared to systemic analgesia.</P>
<P>Ten studies reported on serious life-threatening postoperative complications.

In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Hendolin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hendolin 1996</LINK> observed three serious atrial dysrhythmias in their systemic analgesic group (n=21) and no serious complications in their epidural analgesic group (n =2 0). <LINK REF="STD-Hommeril-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hommeril 1994</LINK> noted that all three patients who experienced respiratory depression in their epidural analgesic group required naloxone but did not require mechanical ventilation. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1991</LINK>) that evaluated the frequency of DVT and PE, a lower frequency of DVT was observed with epidural anesthesia and analgesia compared to general anesthesia and systemic analgesia (3 / 17 vs 13 / 22; P = 0.02).

<P>Although the use of thromboprophylaxis and the risk of epidural hematoma are important considerations with epidural analgesia in hip and knee replacement surgery, no study reported details on the use of warfarin, heparin, or low molecular weight heparins for thromboprophylaxis nor did any study report epidural hematoma as an outcome.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-09 13:31:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>Despite strict selection criteria for this systematic review, the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia in patients undergoing hip or knee replacements vary in terms of the patient populations, interventions, and outcome measures. These differences across studies, coupled with the small patient sample sizes, limit the strength of the conclusions that may be drawn. At rest, epidural analgesia may be superior to systemic analgesia in the early (4 to 6 hours) postoperative period but the difference is no longer significant by 18 to 24 hours. For pain relief with leg movement or ambulation, the evidence suggests epidural analgesia may be superior to systemic analgesia; however, the data could not be pooled to provide a quantitative estimate of the effect.</P>
<P>No statistically significant differences were seen in frequency of nausea and vomiting or respiratory depression between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia; however, epidural analgesia results in lower frequency of sedation and greater frequencies of urinary retention, pruritis, and hypotension. Rare complications of epidural analgesia, such as epidural hematoma or epidural abscess, were not reported. The total numbers of events for each group were small (&lt;200); therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>The current evidence does not demonstrate differences in life-threatening postoperative complications. Again, the total number of patients in the included studies is too small to draw conclusions on infrequent events. Other systematic reviews of postoperative epidural analgesia compared to systemic analgesia suggest that the former modality may reduce postoperative respiratory complications (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 1998</LINK>) and cardiac complications (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 2001</LINK>). Rodgers et al (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 2000</LINK>) reviewed 141 RCTs of neuraxial blockade compared to general anesthesia and found a reduction in mortality with intraoperative neuraxial blockade (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not with perioperative neuraxial blockade (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.08). Intraoperative neuraxial blockade appeared to be associated with a decreased frequency of DVT (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.72) with over 80% of the data coming from orthopedic trials (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 2000</LINK>). Similar risk reductions were seen for PE (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.69; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 2000</LINK>). The extent to which postoperative epidural analgesia affects the frequency of DVT and PE was not reported. In general, additional adequately-powered RCTs are needed using relevant clinical endpoints before conclusions can be drawn on the effect of postoperative epidural analgesia on postoperative complications.</P>
<P>Despite the clinical importance of functional outcomes, few studies have evaluated functional measures. No study has used validated functional measures. The effect of postoperative analgesics on function is still uncertain. Similarly, the effect of postoperative analgesics on length of hospital stay is unclear. Length of stay can be influenced by many factors, including factors unrelated to the patient's medical or rehabilitation status. Use of strict discharge criteria would be helpful in controlling for factors influencing length of stay. Furthermore, it would be useful if triallists reported the median as the statistic of central tendency, rather than the mean, given the skewed nature of length of stay data.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Epidural analgesia may be useful for pain relief after hip or knee replacement surgery; however, the benefits may be limited to the early (four to six hours) postoperative period. An epidural infusion of local anesthetic or local anesthetic-narcotic mixture may be better than epidural narcotic alone. The magnitude of pain relief must be weighed against the frequency of adverse events. The current evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the frequency of rare complications from epidural analgesia, postoperative morbidity or mortality, functional outcomes, or length of hospital stay.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large well-designed randomised clinical trials are still needed to answer questions on the effect of epidural analgesia, compared to systemic analgesia, on important clinical outcomes in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement. Measurements of pain need to be standardised to permit pooling of results. Important clinical and rehabilitative outcomes need to be incorporated into future studies. The required sample sizes will necessitate concerted efforts by collaborative research groups in multicentre trials. To reflect clinical practice, current thromboprophylactic practices need to be incorporated, in a standardised fashion, as part of the interventions. Serious adverse events, such as epidural hematoma, should be included to enable clinicians and patients to weigh the risks and benefits of epidural analgesia.</P>

<P>Degree of knee flexion, measured daily until discharge, was significantly (P&lt;0.001) greater in patients receiving epidural analgesia compared to patients receiving intravenous analgesia. A statistically significant difference (P=0.03) in favour of the epidural analgesia group persisted at six weeks after knee replacement. There was no difference in degree of knee flexion between the two groups 3 months after knee replacement. Similarly, degree of knee flexion, measured daily until discharge, was significantly (P&lt;0.001) greater in patients receiving 3-in-1 block compared to patients receiving intravenous analgesia. A statistically significant difference (P=0.03) in favour of the 3-in-1 block group persisted at six weeks after knee replacement. There was no difference in degree of knee flexion between the two groups 3 months after knee replacement. Epidural analgesia or 3-in-1 block permitted patients to reach 90 degrees of knee flexion faster than intravenous analgesia (P&lt;0.001; 8+/-5 days [epidural], 11+/-6 days [3-in-1 block]; 17+/-7 days [intravenous]).</P>
