<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a form of skin inflammation which occurs particularly on sun-exposed skin and can cause scarring. All forms of cutaneous lupus erythematosus are most common in women of childbearing age, which is important because some treatments, including thalidomide and acitretin, can cause birth defects, and hydroxychloroquine may cause damage to the eye or ear. As the chronic nature and scarring of DLE can have psychological impact, and some treatments may produce serious adverse effects, we felt it was important to combat uncertainty and identify the best and safest treatment. The evidence is current to September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to identify the best treatment for people with DLE, to reduce the risk of scarring and possible psychological effects. We searched for all possible drug treatments, including topical agents (steroids and pimecrolimus or tacrolimus) and oral agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, retinoids, methotrexate, azathioprine, lenalidomide, and biological agents. Potentially, any of these interventions could have been compared with placebo or with any other intervention. We excluded surgery, laser, photoprotection, phototherapy, and other forms of physical therapy as we did not consider them drug treatments. We hoped to find evidence for effective treatment, without serious adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified five studies, involving 197 people (aged between 17 and 82). Participants were recruited from Europe, Scandinavia, Iran, and the United States. Most of the skin lesions were recorded on the face, ear, and scalp. The duration of disease ranged from one month to 16 years. Treatments included steroid creams of different potencies (fluocinonide and betamethasone cream, both potent steroids; and hydrocortisone, a low-potency steroid); oral hydroxychloroquine; oral acitretin; tacrolimus cream; pimecrolimus cream; and salbutamol cream. The tacrolimus and salbutamol trials used placebo in the control arm.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In a trial involving 78 participants, fluocinonide cream 0.05% appeared nearly three times as effective as hydrocortisone cream 1% in terms of complete clearing of the DLE (27% versus 10%). The percentage of people who had a reduction in the redness of at least 50% of their sores was not reported, nor was patient satisfaction. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone and one person developed acne; burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide. Adverse events did not stop any participants continuing to apply the creams.</P>
<P>Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg and acitretin 50 mg appear to work equally well in terms of complete resolution (50% versus 46%, respectively). Marked improvement in redness may be less in the acitretin group (42% versus 68%), but neither drug has been compared with placebo. Patient satisfaction was not measured. Adverse events, more common in the acitretin group, were reported as minor, although four people stopped treatment due to dry lips and gastrointestinal symptoms.</P>
<P>Pimecrolimus cream 1% (an anti-inflammatory cream) was compared with betamethasone (steroid) 0.1% cream in a small 8-week study involving 10 people, but none of the review primary outcomes were reported; nor were adverse effects.</P>
<P>A longer study using a similar type of cream, tacrolimus 0.1%, compared with placebo did not report the primary outcomes. Slight burning and itching was reported in five participants applying tacrolimus, and a herpes simplex infection came back in one participant. A few people reported burning or irritation after the use of tacrolimus cream, but not sufficient to cause withdrawal.</P>
<P>R-salbutamol 0.5% topical cream was compared with placebo cream in a trial of 37 people, but the primary outcomes of this review were not reported. There were only minor adverse events reported in each group: 15 in the placebo group and 24 in the salbutamol group.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>For our primary outcome of clearing or excellent improvement, we had low-quality evidence for fluocinonide 0.05% compared with hydrocortisone 1% as the only study assessing this comparison contained a high number of dropouts; while for acitretin (50 mg) compared with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg), for our primary outcomes of reduction in erythema and complete resolution we rated the quality of evidence as low, as the study contained a small number of people and differences between the groups in the number of people who had forms of lupus other than DLE. Overall, moderate-quality evidence was found for adverse events.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-21 09:49:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus, which can cause scarring. Many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some (such as thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) are potentially toxic. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009. We wanted to update the review to assess whether any new information was available to treat DLE, as we were still unsure of the effectiveness of available drugs and how to select the most appropriate treatment for an individual with DLE.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-02 20:34:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated our searches of the following databases to 22 September 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-02 20:35:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs to treat people with DLE in any population group and of either gender. Comparisons included any drug used for DLE against either another drug or against placebo cream. We excluded laser treatment, surgery, phototherapy, other forms of physical therapy, and photoprotection as we did not consider them drug treatments.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-20 15:14:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two reviewers independently extracted data onto a data extraction sheet, resolving disagreements by discussion. We used standard methods to assess risk of bias, as expected by Cochrane.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 20:46:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials involving 197 participants were included. Three new trials were included in this update. None of the five trials were of high quality.</P>
<P>'Risk of bias' assessments identified potential sources of bias in each study. One study used an inappropriate randomisation method, and incomplete outcome data were a concern in another as 15 people did not complete the trial. We found most of the trials to be at low risk in terms of blinding, but three of the five did not describe allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The included trials inadequately addressed the primary outcome measures of this review (percentage with complete resolution of skin lesions, percentage with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions, and improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures).</P>
<P>One study of fluocinonide cream 0.05% (potent steroid) compared with hydrocortisone cream 1% (low-potency steroid) in 78 people reported complete resolution of skin lesions in 27% (10/37) of participants in the fluocinonide cream group and in 10% (4/41) in the hydrocortisone group, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (risk ratio (RR) 2.77, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.08, 1 study, n = 78, low-quality evidence). The other primary outcome measures were not reported. Adverse events did not require discontinuation of the drug. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone, and one person developed acne. Burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>A comparative trial of two oral agents, acitretin (50 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily), reported two of the outcomes of interest: complete resolution was seen in 13 of 28 participants (46%) on acitretin and 15 of 30 participants (50%) on hydoxychloroquine (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.59, 1 study, n = 58, low-quality evidence). Clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions was reported in 10 of 24 participants (42%) on acitretin and 17 of 25 (68%) on hydroxychloroquine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.06, 1 study, n = 49, low-quality evidence). This comparison did not assess improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures. Participants taking acitretin showed a small increase in serum triglyceride, not sufficient to require withdrawal of the drug. The main adverse effects were dry lips (93% of the acitretin group and 20% of the hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11% of the acitretin group and 17% of the hydroxychloroquine group). Four participants on acitretin withdrew due to gastrointestinal events or dry lips (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>One trial randomised 10 people with DLE to apply a calcineurin inhibitor, pimecrolimus 1% cream, or a potent steroid, betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream, for eight weeks. The study reported none of the primary outcome measures, nor did it present data on adverse events.</P>
<P>A trial of calcineurin inhibitors compared tacrolimus cream 0.1% with placebo (vehicle) over 12 weeks in 14 people, but reported none of our primary outcome measures. In the tacrolimus group, five participants complained of slight burning and itching, and for one participant, a herpes simplex infection was reactivated (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Topical R-salbutamol 0.5% cream was compared with placebo (vehicle) over eight weeks in one trial of 37 people with DLE. There was a significant improvement in pain and itch in the salbutamol group at two, four, six, and eight weeks compared to placebo, but the trial did not record a formal measure of quality of life. None of the primary outcome measures were reported. Changes in erythema did not show benefit of salbutamol over placebo, but we could not obtain from the trial report the number of participants with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions. There were 15 events in the placebo group (experienced by 12 participants) and 24 in the salbutamol group (experienced by nine participants). None of the adverse events were considered serious (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 20:47:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluocinonide cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in clearing DLE skin lesions. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy in terms of complete resolution, although adverse effects might be more frequent with acitretin, and clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions occurred less often in participants applying acitretin. Moderate-quality evidence found adverse events were minor on the whole. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat DLE. Overall, the quality of the trials and levels of uncertainty were such that there is a need for further trials of sufficient duration comparing, in particular, topical steroids with other agents.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-02 20:57:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic and common form of cutaneous lupus &#8212; a form of skin inflammation of unknown cause. It occurs particularly on sun-exposed skin, such as the face, ears, and scalp, but occasionally is much more extensive, involving large areas of skin. Some people with DLE have associated disease in other parts of the body, but the majority of people with DLE are otherwise healthy. People with DLE are seen frequently in skin clinics throughout the world.</P>
<P>There have been no accurate studies of the prevalence of DLE, although all forms of lupus erythematosus are particularly common in women of childbearing age. The diagnosis of DLE is usually made easily on clinical grounds, characteristic clinical findings being erythema (redness), follicular plugging (blocked and enlarged openings to hair follicles), pigmentary disturbances, telangiectasia (dilated capillaries), and atrophy (skin thinning). When the diagnosis is in doubt, a skin biopsy (microscopic examination) may be required to confirm the diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhn 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to improve consistency in the reporting of clinical trials, the CLASI (Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Area and Severity Index) scoring system has been developed (<LINK REF="REF-Albrecht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albrecht 2005</LINK>). The CLASI allows assessment of both active inflammation (erythema, scale, and hypertrophy) and damage (dyspigmentation, scarring, atrophy), in different body areas, but does not include a quality of life score. It has not been tested in different populations.</P>
<P>Early effective treatment may lead to total clearing of the skin lesions, but failure of treatment results in permanent scarring. The depressed scars, hair loss, and pigmentary changes are often extremely disfiguring, particularly in darker-skinned people. Permanent scarring is the rule if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Great emotional distress, social isolation, and difficulty obtaining work are problems frequently suffered by these patients. Involvement of the skin of the fingers and toes may markedly impair hand function and limit walking (<LINK REF="REF-Vasquez--2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasquez 2013</LINK>). In addition, people with DLE are at risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma in the scarred areas (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandes 2015</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-03 00:39:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The anti-malarial drug chloroquine is the traditional therapy for DLE (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodthagen-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodthagen 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callen 1982</LINK>). It is cheap and readily available worldwide. Flare-ups of systemic lupus were noted to occur with increased frequency after chloroquine was stopped (<LINK REF="REF-Rothfield-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothfield 1963</LINK>). However, some people cannot tolerate the drug and it is known to fail in others. Other anti-malarial agents have been used, sometimes in combination with chloroquine, but are not widely available (<LINK REF="REF-Kierland-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kierland 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maguire-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maguire 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years, hydroxychloroquine has been used in place of chloroquine in many countries, because ocular side-effects were reported to be less frequent with hydroxychloroquine, but retinal toxicity has subsequently also been recognised with hydroxychloroquine (<LINK REF="REF-Geamanu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geamanu 2014</LINK>). The efficacy of the two forms of the drug is thought to be the same, but no trials exist to confirm this in DLE (<LINK REF="REF-Kreuter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreuter 2009</LINK>). In discussing the treatment of DLE in 1961, Prakken commented that: "This [lack of evidence] is illustrated by a survey of our literature on the treatment of chronic lupus erythematosus. Although many papers agree on their reports of favourable results, the value of our therapy remains doubtful because the influence of the placebo effect and the publications effect has not been eliminated" (<LINK REF="REF-Prakken-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prakken 1961</LINK>). However, Rees felt that discoid lupus responded so dramatically to chloroquine that "double-blind studies are not required" (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 1963</LINK>). In 1964, Kraak performed a literature search and concluded that available information was insufficient to evaluate the many therapies that are recommended: "The literature leaves room for the alarming assumption that none of the drugs might do any good" (<LINK REF="REF-Kraak-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraak 1964</LINK>). His group performed a non-randomised double-blind trial comparing hydroxychloroquine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kraak-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kraak 1965</LINK>). Spontaneous improvement or clearing occurred in some of their patients, particularly in the winter months (<LINK REF="STD-Kraak-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kraak 1965</LINK>). The group on chloroquine showed a greater tendency to improve (<LINK REF="STD-Kraak-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kraak 1965</LINK>). Other workers have been so concerned about possible ocular side-effects (thought to be very rare on current low dosage regimens) that chloroquine was excluded from their trial (<LINK REF="REF-Mackey-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackey 1974</LINK>). Smoking may reduce the efficacy of chloroquine in people with lupus: a recent review reports studies that demonstrate an inverse relationship between number of cigarettes smoked and chloroquine blood levels (<LINK REF="REF-Chasset-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chasset 2015</LINK>). Unfortunately many of the other agents, reported anecdotally to be of value in discoid lupus erythematosus, have considerable potential side-effects and some, such as thalidomide, may produce major malformations in the foetus if taken during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Cort_x00e9_s_x002d_Hern_x00e1_ndez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortés-Hernández 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many other agents have been used to treat this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Callen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callen 1997</LINK>). Sunscreens and sun avoidance reduce flares of cutaneous lupus, but are not usually sufficient alone (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011a</LINK>).

<P>Steroids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, acting on genetic material in the cell nucleus, via steroid receptors in the cell (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2005</LINK>). Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, which are calcineurin inhibitors, inhibit the activity of T lymphocytes (via calcium channels), a key cell in the development of cutaneous lupus (<LINK REF="REF-Khandpur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khandpur 2004</LINK>). Salbutamol may exert an anti-inflammatory effect by activating receptors on the surface of cells, particularly lymphocytes and eosinophils (<LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK>). Evidence suggests that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which are antimalarials, have an effect on inflammation by reducing antigen presentation and the production of inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Rainsford-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rainsford 2015</LINK>). The anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of retinoids, such as acitretin, are not fully understood. Retinoid receptors allow access to the cell nucleus, and retinoids promote normal cell growth (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Permanent scarring is likely if treatment is delayed or inadequate. People with DLE often experience great emotional distress. Social isolation and difficulty obtaining work are frequent problems. The relative efficacies of possible forms of treatment compared to placebo or each other need to be clearly established. Some of these agents (such as the cytotoxics) are potentially toxic (<LINK REF="REF-Weinblatt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinblatt 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2015</LINK>). Both thalidomide and the retinoids are highly teratogenic (they may cause birth defects when given to pregnant women), which renders their use in fertile women problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2013</LINK>).

<P>Of the 26 full texts, we excluded 23 studies (14 did not describe outcomes in the DLE group specifically and others were excluded because they referred to photoprotection trials and not drug trials or were not RCTs) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

We noted that diagnosis of DLE was generally based on clinical judgement in the early studies, but investigators required histological (skin biopsy) confirmation in the three new studies.</P>
<P>Of the nine drug trials of DLE listed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>, the interventions included etanercept, other biologics, R-salbutamol, pimecrolimus, and an oral retinoid, alitretinoin. Half of the studies were described as complete but results have not yet been published. We attempted to contact two of the investigators, without success. One investigator reported that their study did not include analysis of the subset with DLE.</P>

<P>The first study, involving 78 people, was a double-blind RCT comparing two steroid creams of different potencies (<LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK>). The creams were prepared in the same cream base and identical tubes, and were compared in a 12-week cross-over trial. A single active lesion on each person was chosen for monitoring. One of the creams was applied for 6 weeks, then the other for a further 6 weeks. Only the outcome prior to cross-over was included in the analysis for this review.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK>, the outcome was based on the authors' own 5-point scale, using a single test site.

There was no assessment by the participants.</P>
<P>Assessment of severity in <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK> was based on an ordinal scale using erythema (redness), infiltration (thickness), and scaling with complete clearing graded as 0, improvement as 1, and no change or deterioration as 2.

<P>Details of the 23 excluded studies can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. In 14 studies, participants had systemic or cutaneous lupus, or both, but the group with DLE were not described specifically, so the influence of treatment in DLE could not be established. Seven trials were not randomised. Authors of two excluded RCTs reported results with topical tacrolimus versus topical clobetasol propionate, and clofazimine versus chloroquine diphosphate (<LINK REF="STD-Bezerra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bezerra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tzung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tzung 2007</LINK>). However, in both studies participants had various forms of cutaneous lupus and results for individual subsets were not reported separately, thus it was not possible to establish the relative benefits of individual treatments in DLE. <LINK REF="STD-Avgerinou-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Avgerinou 2012</LINK> was not an RCT and the DLE subset was not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Gammon--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gammon 2011</LINK> did not report results for the DLE subset. <LINK REF="STD-Manzi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Manzi 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merrill-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Merrill 2010a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merrill-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Merrill 2010b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merrill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Merrill 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Szepietowski-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Szepietowski 2013</LINK> described people with SLE and did not provide data for the DLE subset.

The main clinical adverse effects were dry lips/cheilitis (93% of the acitretin and 20% of the hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11% of the acitretin and 17% of the hydroxychloroquine group, but no specific information was provided). Laboratory studies revealed changes in triglycerides in both groups, the levels rising from a mean of 1.66 to 2.10 mmol/l in the acitretin group (P = 0.01) and falling from 1.94 to 1.50 mmol/l in the hydroxychloroquine group (P = 0.02). The difference between the two groups was highly significant (P = 0.006).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK> study, adverse events were not reported.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK> trial there were 39 reported adverse events, 15 in the placebo group and 24 in the salbutamol 0.5% topical cream group (moderate-quality evidence). None of the adverse events were considered serious and the adverse events did not appear to be related to the trial medication.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK> reported that five people experienced itching or burning at the site of tacrolimus 0.1% cream application, sometimes lasting up to six weeks, and one participant developed herpes simplex infection of the lip during treatment (moderate-quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events. No adverse events were experienced by the participants using the placebo cream.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 22:48:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials are reported in this version of the review, with a total of 197 participants. Three of the studies are new to this update (<LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2016</LINK>). Two of the trials included small numbers of participants (10 in <LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK> and 14 in <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions in the five trials were topical steroids, hydroxychloroquine, acitretin, topical salbutamol, topical tacrolimus, and topical pimecrolimus.</P>
<P>The study of topical steroids provides some evidence that a potent steroid cream, fluocinonide 0.05%, may be superior to low-potency hydrocortisone 1% in the complete resolution of discoid lupus erythematosus skin lesions (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK>). The ideal duration of treatment or likelihood of recurrences following treatment has not been established. Our second primary outcome (percentage of people with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions) was not measured.</P>
<P>In the comparative trial of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg and acitretin 50 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK>), no difference in efficacy was demonstrated between the two drugs in terms of the primary outcome, with complete resolution of skin lesions reported in 46% of people taking acitretin and in 50% of those on hydroxychloroquine. Regarding the second primary outcome, 42% of participants taking acitretin showed improvement in erythema in at least 50% of lesions compared with 68% of the hydroxychloroquine group (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two studies of calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus 1% and tacrolimus 0.1%) (<LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>), and the study of R-salbutamol 0.5% topical cream (<LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK>), unfortunately included only 61 participants in all and did not report the primary outcomes of the review (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is some evidence that the trial drugs were free of serious side-effects, but the short duration of most of the trials does not allow any conclusion about long-term adverse effects of topical steroids. Adverse events were reported in the 12-week tacrolimus 0.1% study, which was compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>), but none were serious. <LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK> (fluocinonide cream 0.05% vs hydrocortisone cream 1%) was short (six weeks in each arm), and thus side-effects of long-term topical steroid use could not be assessed. <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK> (acitretin 50 mg vs hydroxychloroquine 400 mg) was the only study that reported discontinuation of participants due to adverse events (four people receiving acitretin discontinued treatment due to dry lips and gastrointestinal symptoms). <LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK> compared topical salbutamol 0.5% cream with placebo (vehicle), and both groups reported minor adverse events but no serious adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK> did not present data on adverse events.</P>
<P>We are uncertain about the effect of the interventions on patient satisfaction/quality of life, as this primary outcome was not measured by any of our included studies. The secondary outcomes of preventing new lesions and implications for healthcare costs were not assessed in any study either. Relapse rate when medication was stopped or reduced was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>. There was no relapse reported in <LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK> at eight weeks, after stopping the trial medication at four weeks; whilst in <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>, participants relapsed by 12 weeks.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-10 14:43:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies in this review have not addressed all the objectives of the review and do not identify the most effective treatment for DLE in all types of participants.</P>
<P>The studies identified in this review did not address (or addressed inadequately) the relative benefits of many currently used interventions, against each other or against placebo, including hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), retinoids, topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, azathioprine, lenalidomide or biological agents. Outcome measures failed to address quality of life measures or, in most cases, relapse rate after medication was stopped. Most studies did not report on complete resolution of skin lesions or clearing of erythema either. Although different populations participated in the trials, there were no trials from Asia, Africa, Australia or South America.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-02 22:54:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials, involving 197 participants were included. Some primary outcome measures in this review (per cent with complete resolution, percentage with at least 50% improvement in erythema) were inadequately addressed in the majority of included trials. Furthermore, quality of life was not assessed in any of the five included studies.</P>
<P>Where quantitative results were provided for primary outcomes, the overall quality of the evidence was judged to be low owing to the small size of most of the studies and high risk of bias on important domains such as incomplete outcome data and non-comparability of treatment arms at baseline.</P>
<P>All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias for blinding as they were all double-blind and interventions were identical in appearance (although for two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK>, the methods used to ensure blinding were not fully described). In four studies the method used to generate the allocation sequence was adequate; however, one study was a quasi-randomised trial where patients were numbered based on time of referral and odd numbered participants were allocated to one treatment and even numbered patients to the other. However, as this study did not include any of our pre-specified primary or secondary outcome measures (instead a total mean severity score was calculated before and after treatment for each participant), no data for this study were presented in our 'Summary of findings' tables. The method used to conceal allocation was also unclear in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK>); however, this was judged to be adequate for the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barikbin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barikbin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>), For four studies, either the numbers analysed were the same as the number recruited or the number of dropouts was very small, so these were judged to be at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. However in the <LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK> study, 15 of the 78 participants did not contribute data towards the primary outcome of clearing or excellent improvement for reasons which may relate to outcome (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Therefore, the quality of evidence on whether there is a difference between fluocinonide and hydrocortisone (low-potency steroid) with respect to clearing or excellent improvement was downgraded by one level. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK>, there were more participants with DLE in the hydroxychloroquine group. This created unbalanced treatment groups, which could have influenced the outcomes of clearing or excellent improvement and more than 50% reduction in erythema (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). We identified no other potential sources of bias that might have had a direct effect on any risk measures presented, However, in many instances our ability to assess these was unclear.</P>
<P>Sample size was judged to be inadequate in all of the included studies, except in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Roenigk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Roenigk 1980</LINK> with 78 participants (others ranged from 10 to 58 participants per study). This resulted in imprecise measures of effect in instances where these were presented, and evidence was therefore downgraded accordingly in instances where assessment of the quality of evidence is provided (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The small numbers in <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK> may weaken the validity of this study, as does the lack of a control arm, as neither intervention is of established efficacy (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The inclusion of people with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an even greater source of possible error and the results require confirmation.</P>
<P>We also assessed the quality of evidence for adverse events leading to discontinuation or significant morbidity in four out of five comparisons in the 'Summary of findings' tables. The quality of evidence was moderate, with downgrading for imprecision in all comparisons because the evidence was based on only one study with a small number of participants. Furthermore, only <LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK> reported participants discontinuing, while the remaining studies only reported minor adverse events. The overall sample size may not have been large enough to identify serious adverse events.</P>
<P>All of the comparisons included in this review were assessed in single studies, which did not allow us to assess consistency of results across studies. As such it was not possible in our review to assess what factors could potentially contribute to differences in findings between studies (heterogeneity).</P>
<P>Indirectness cannot be assessed with confidence in the included studies. As the studies were performed in specialist clinics and most people with DLE are likely to be treated initially at that level, the setting is not out of line with clinical practice.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-05-02 22:55:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to conduct a comprehensive search for studies, but the fact that one study has not yet been incorporated may be a source of potential bias (<LINK REF="STD-Pothinamthong-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pothinamthong 2012</LINK>). Studies in which participants had SLE or undefined cutaneous LE were excluded from the review, but two studies that included participants with DLE and SCLE, (<LINK REF="STD-Ruzicka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruzicka 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2011</LINK>), were included and this may have introduced a bias. There were 12 studies identified in trials registries, but unpublished and most without contact details. The reviewers were unable to establish the outcome of these trials. After the publication of the original protocol and review (<LINK REF="REF-Jessop-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jessop 2000</LINK>), a scoring measure was published, and has been widely used for reporting outcomes in DLE (<LINK REF="REF-Albrecht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albrecht 2005</LINK>). One included study (<LINK REF="STD-Jemec-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jemec 2009</LINK>) reported outcomes using this scoring measure, but the data were not included in our systematic review because this type of outcome measure was not specified in the review protocol.</P>

<OL>
<LI>There is currently insufficient evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of severe DLE.</LI>
<LI>Potent steroid cream (fluocinonide) appears to be more effective than low-potency steroid cream (hydrocortisone) in the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus, although the potent steroid was effective in only about a quarter of the people treated and the low-potency steroid in about 10%.</LI>
<LI>Both hydroxychloroquine and acitretin are associated with marked improvement or clearing in about half of all people treated, but neither drug has been tested against placebo in a randomised clinical trial.</LI>
<LI>At present there is no reliable evidence to support the use of other specific treatments for discoid lupus erythematosus. This should not be seen as evidence that current treatment is ineffective but rather that evidence of effectiveness is lacking. Notably, there have been several large multicentre trials of newer biological agents (<LINK REF="STD-Manzi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Manzi 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merrill-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Merrill 2010a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merrill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Merrill 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merrill-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Merrill 2010b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Szepietowski-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Szepietowski 2013</LINK>), but unfortunately cutaneous subsets have not been reported separately, so we cannot reach any conclusion about possible benefits of biological agents in DLE. Trials investigating the use of topical biological agents have been registered but no data from such trials is available at present.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-02 23:23:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A combination of small numbers, different outcome measures and short duration reduce the strength of most of these trials and the results need to be confirmed in larger trials.</P>
<P>The early single lesion of DLE may respond well to potent steroid creams. One of the goals should be to prevent scarring as, once it occurs, it is largely irreversible.</P>
<P>Well-planned randomised controlled trials are needed to provide a guide to the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. Trials should not mix different types of lupus together and ideally the diagnosis should be confirmed with a skin biopsy. There is a need for trials comparing topical steroids with other agents. The outcome measures should be stated clearly and should include participants' views and information about scarring. If the CLASI scoring system is adopted widely, more consistent outcome measures may be obtained. If future trials were to include a core set of outcome measures, following the recent COUSIN initiative from the Cochrane Skin Group, there is a much greater likelihood of being able to pool results from multiple studies in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>Also, the trials should be of sufficient duration to allow for seasonal variation and capture of relapses (suggested minimum of 9 months). Recurrence rate on and off treatment and occurrence of side-effects should be documented. Priorities for further studies, involving larger numbers, are as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Potent topical steroid versus chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (these antimalarials are cheap and widely available in many countries).</LI>
<LI>Potent topical steroid versus oral retinoid (more expensive and can cause birth defects).</LI>
<LI>Potent topical steroid versus methotrexate (cheap and available but possible liver and bone marrow toxicity, so needs careful monitoring).</LI>
<LI>Potent topical steroid versus lenalidomide (similar to thalidomide, but possibly with a better safety profile).</LI>
<LI>Potent topical steroids or chloroquine versus biological agents.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between the protocol and the current update</HEADING>
<P>For differences between other published versions, please see the 'Differences between protocol and review section' within the original publications.</P>
<P>Note: many of the methods section headings are missing from the protocol and previously published versions. In this update, we have tried to rectify this, in line with the current <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> and RevMan software.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>: this section has been updated.</P>
<P>
<B>Objectives</B>: the sentence 'To identify the need for further study to make rational clinical decisions possible when treating cutaneous lupus' was omitted from this update in line with current <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and RevMan 5 software and the previously published versions of the review as it was considered redundant.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of interventions</B>: we planned to include other anti-malarial quinines other than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but did not find any RCTs for these interventions. Although not planned in the protocol, in this update we did additionally include lenalidomide, biological agents, (including abatacept, adalimumab, belimumab, etanercept, efalizumab, infliximab, rituximab, sifalimumab and sirukumab), topical calcineurin antagonists, (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) and topical salbutamol as these agents had become available and trials had been performed in connective tissue disorders. We also clarified the types of comparators we would accept, as this detail was not specified in the protocol. We expanded the list of excluded interventions to include phototherapy and photoprotection, which were not originally listed in the protocol, for clarification only. This does not represent a change in methodology.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcome measures</B>: in a previous version of the review, under <B>Primary outcomes</B>, we added 'percentage of people with' to our 'complete resolution of skin lesions&#8230;' and 'clearing of erythema&#8230;' outcomes, and these have been retained (<LINK REF="REF-Jessop-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jessop 2009</LINK>). Note that we accepted the following terms to describe complete resolution: complete clearing, clearing, marked improvement and excellent improvement.</P>
<P>
<B>Searching other resource</B>: although not planned in the protocol, we searched Index Medicus by hand for studies relating to treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus for the years 1956 to 1966 because we thought it important, and we recorded all adverse events reported in the included and excluded studies as we recognise the need to report adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Search methods for identification of studies</B>: the databases and date ranges that we planned to search in the protocol have been extended for this update review, in line with current standard search methods.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection and analysis</B>: In the original protocol, we had not made plans at all regarding how to deal with within-patient studies, missing data, sensitivity analysis, and 'Summary of findings' tables, but we now have in line with current requirements.</P>
<P>Where results are estimated for individual studies with low numbers of outcomes (&lt; 10 in total) or where the total sample size is less than 30 participants, we decided to report the proportion of outcomes in each treatment group together with a P value from a Fisher&#8217;s Exact test. This follows guidance provided by the Skin Group Statistics editors on how to deal with small numbers, made available since the last update of this review.</P>
<P>"We tested statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic (0% to 40%: may not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: represents considerable heterogeneity) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).&#8221; An assessment of how we would deal with heterogeneity was missing from the original protocol therefore we have amended this at this stage in the event that future updates of this review will contain a pooled analysis of two or more studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</B>: the text within this section was written in the 'Quality rating of included studies' section of the protocol. The review has been amended to follow the RevMan 5 recommended headings and the new <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> guidelines.</P>
<P>Two additional headings have been added to this section: Comparability of the two arms and Intention to treat analysis.</P>
<P>According to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, controlled trials that allocate participants by quasi-randomisation, or that fail to conceal allocation during recruitment, are at risk of selection bias. We have included such trials, but have indicated that there is high risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Imbalance at baseline has been assessed in this version of the review and added to the risk of bias tables.</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>: although not planned in the protocol, for any significant outcomes (P &lt; 0.05) we wanted to present the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) where the first treatment in the comparison is harmful (risk ratio (RR) &gt; 1 for safety outcomes). We did not do this as no significant harms were reported.</P>
<P>In the protocol, we did not pre-state the effect measures that we would report. For dichotomous outcomes (primary outcomes 1 and 2 and adverse events), results are presented as RR with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For this update, for continuous outcomes (primary outcome 3), we planned to present results in the form of mean differences (with 95% CIs). Where there were treatment comparisons where studies used different scales for the same outcome, we planned to convert results to standard mean differences (SMD) to allow pooling of results. We could not carry out these plans because the studies were few and heterogeneous.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues</B> &gt; <B>Cross-over trials</B>: in the protocol we did not plan how to analyse cross-over trials; but having included such a study, we followed the guidance provided in Section 16.4.4 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where no evidence of a carry-over effect was present, analyses of paired differences were presented if these data could be obtained from the trial report. Otherwise, only data from the first treatment period were used.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues</B> &gt;<B> Within-patient studies</B>: although not planned in the protocol, internally controlled trials were analysed using techniques for paired designs (e.g. paired t-test, McNemar's test). Where appropriate, these were included in additional data tables and not pooled with parallel group trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity</B>: in the protocol, we had planned to use statistical tests for homogeneity between studies. However, assessment of heterogeneity was not performed as no findings were based on pooled results from 2 or more trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>: in the protocol, we planned to draw up a synthesis of included trials; however, this was not possible with the data in the studies we found, due to heterogeneity of study methods and interventions. No two trials investigated the same interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</B>: in the protocol, we had planned to perform subgroup analysis on the following measures: disseminated DLE versus localised DLE; DLE with systemic lupus versus DLE without systemic lupus; histologically proven versus clinically diagnosed DLE; and effect of ethnic group on outcome. However, we were unable to address these issues, as none of the studies provided data on individual subgroups, (and two of the trials enrolled small numbers of participants).</P>
<P>Trials that included more than one subset of cutaneous lupus were included if most participants had DLE and the outcome data described outcomes for DLE.</P>
<P>
<B>Other</B>: we planned where possible to calculate cost effectiveness ratios using quality-of life-measures; however, the studies identified did not provide these data.</P>
<P>
<B>'Summary of findings' table</B>: although not planned in the protocol, we used <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=z1407181809005368162413537309618&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-GRADEpro-2008">GRADEpro 2008</A> to create a 'Summary of findings' table as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=z1407181809005368162413537309618&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). In this, we have summarised the primary outcomes for the most important comparisons. Subgroup analysis was not possible.</P>
