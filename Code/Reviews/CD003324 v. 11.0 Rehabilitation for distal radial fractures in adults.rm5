<TITLE>Rehabilitation as part of treatment for adults with a broken wrist</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-23 12:24:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background and aim</B>
</P>
<P>Particularly in older women, a broken wrist (comprising a fracture at the lower end of the radius, one of the two forearm bones) can result from a fall onto an outstretched hand. Treatment usually includes putting the bone fragments back in place, if badly displaced, and immobilising the wrist in a plaster cast. Surgery may be considered for more seriously displaced fractures. Rehabilitation with interventions such as exercises and other physical interventions is used to help prevent complications, such as stiffness and aching, restore function and speed up recovery.</P>
<P>This review set out to evaluate the effects, primarily on wrist function, of different rehabilitation interventions for treating these injuries.</P>
<P>
<B>Search results</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the scientific literature up to January 2015 and found 26 randomised controlled studies, involving 1269 mainly female and older patients. Only four of the 23 treatment comparisons covered by these 26 studies were tested by more than one study. Participants of 15 studies were initially treated with plaster cast immobilisation. Some or all participants in the other 11 studies were treated with surgery. In seven studies, the rehabilitation intervention being tested started during wrist immobilisation. In the other 19 studies, rehabilitation started when the cast had been removed.</P>
<P>All studies were small and were designed in a way that may affect the reliability of their findings. Most studies did not report on patient-reported outcome measures of function and did not follow up patients for long enough. We judged the quality of the reported evidence as either low or very low and thus we are not confident that the results described below are true.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions started during immobilisation</I>
<BR/>Two studies provided very low quality evidence that rehabilitation (hand therapy or task-orientated therapy) improved hand function after the plaster cast was removed, but not in the longer-term. One study provided very low quality evidence that outcome after supervised exercises did not differ from outcome after unsupervised exercises. Four studies provided very low quality evidence of some slight benefits of four different single methods of rehabilitation that were given with standard care.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions started post-immobilisation, mainly after removal of the plaster cast</I>

<BR/>
There was very low quality evidence from one study of improved function for a single session of physiotherapy, primarily advice and instructions for a home exercise programme, compared with 'no intervention' after cast removal. There was low quality evidence from four very different studies of no clinically important differences in outcome in patients receiving routine physiotherapy or occupational therapy in addition to instructions for home exercises versus instructions for home exercises from a therapist. There was very low quality evidence of better short-term hand function in the participants given physiotherapy than in those given either instructions for home exercises by a surgeon (one study) or a progressive home exercise programme (one study). Both studies comparing physiotherapy or occupational therapy versus a progressive home exercise programme after surgery involving plate fixation (a metal plate and screws are used to hold the broken bone in place) found low quality evidence in favour of a structured programme of home exercises preceded by instructions or coaching. One study provided very low quality evidence of a short-term, but not persisting, benefit of accelerated compared with usual rehabilitation after surgery involving plate fixation.</P>
<P>For studies testing single interventions applied post-immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence of no clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving passive mobilisation, ice, pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF), PEMF plus ice, whirlpool immersion, and a dynamic extension splint for patients with a stiff wrist, compared with no intervention. This finding applied also to single studies comparing PEMF versus ice, and a new type of massage treatment for swelling when compared with the traditional approach. There was very low quality evidence from single studies of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion immediately after removal of external fixation, intermittent pneumatic compression and ultrasound therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions </B>
</P>
<P>We concluded that there was not enough evidence available to determine the best form of rehabilitation for people with wrist fractures. Priority questions need to be identified before further studies are done.</P>

<P>Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older people with osteoporosis.

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs evaluating rehabilitation as part of the management of fractures of the distal radius sustained by adults.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-23 10:41:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 26 trials, involving 1269 mainly female and older patients. With few exceptions, these studies did not include people with serious fracture or treatment-related complications, or older people with comorbidities and poor overall function that would have precluded trial participation or required more intensive treatment. Only four of the 23 comparisons covered by these 26 trials were evaluated by more than one trial. Participants of 15 trials were initially treated conservatively, involving plaster cast immobilisation. Initial treatment was surgery (external fixation or internal fixation) for all participants in five trials. Initial treatment was either surgery or plaster cast alone in six trials. Rehabilitation started during immobilisation in seven trials and after post-immobilisation in the other 19 trials. As well as being small, the majority of the included trials had methodological shortcomings and were at high risk of bias, usually related to lack of blinding, that could affect the validity of their findings. Based on GRADE criteria for assessment quality, we rated the evidence for each of the 23 comparisons as either low or very low quality; both ratings indicate considerable uncertainty in the findings.</P>
<P>For interventions started during immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence of improved hand function for hand therapy compared with instructions only at four days after plaster cast removal, with some beneficial effects continuing one month later (one trial, 17 participants). There was very low quality evidence of improved hand function in the short-term, but not in the longer-term (three months), for early occupational therapy (one trial, 40 participants), and of a lack of differences in outcome between supervised and unsupervised exercises (one trial, 96 participants).</P>
<P>Four trials separately provided very low quality evidence of clinically marginal benefits of specific interventions applied in addition to standard care (therapist-applied programme of digit mobilisation during external fixation (22 participants); pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) during cast immobilisation (60 participants); cyclic pneumatic soft tissue compression using an inflatable cuff placed under the plaster cast (19 participants); and cross-education involving strength training of the non-fractured hand during cast immobilisation with or without surgical repair (39 participants)).</P>
<P>For interventions started post-immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence from one study (47 participants) of improved function for a single session of physiotherapy, primarily advice and instructions for a home exercise programme, compared with 'no intervention' after cast removal. There was low quality evidence from four heterogeneous trials (30, 33, 66 and 75 participants) of a lack of clinically important differences in outcome in patients receiving routine physiotherapy or occupational therapy in addition to instructions for home exercises versus instructions for home exercises from a therapist. There was very low quality evidence of better short-term hand function in participants given physiotherapy than in those given either instructions for home exercises by a surgeon (16 participants, one trial) or a progressive home exercise programme (20 participants, one trial). Both trials (46 and 76 participants) comparing physiotherapy or occupational therapy versus a progressive home exercise programme after volar plate fixation provided low quality evidence in favour of a structured programme of home exercises preceded by instructions or coaching. One trial (63 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a short-term, but not persisting, benefit of accelerated compared with usual rehabilitation after volar plate fixation.</P>
<P>For trials testing single interventions applied post-immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence of no clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving passive mobilisation (69 participants, two trials), ice (83 participants, one trial), PEMF (83 participants, one trial), PEMF plus ice (39 participants, one trial), whirlpool immersion (24 participants, one trial), and dynamic extension splint for patients with wrist contracture (40 participants, one trial), compared with no intervention. This finding applied also to the trial (44 participants) comparing PEMF versus ice, and the trial (29 participants) comparing manual oedema mobilisation versus traditional oedema treatment. There was very low quality evidence from single trials of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion post-external fixation (seven participants), intermittent pneumatic compression (31 participants) and ultrasound (38 participants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-23 10:49:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to establish the relative effectiveness of the various interventions used in the rehabilitation of adults with fractures of the distal radius. Further randomised trials are warranted. However, in order to optimise research effort and engender the large multicentre randomised trials that are required to inform practice, these should be preceded by research that aims to identify priority questions.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-23 10:58:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fracture of the distal radius is one of the most common fractures in many predominantly white and older populations (<LINK REF="REF-Sahlin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahlin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>). It has been estimated that a 50-year-old white woman in the USA or Northern Europe has a 15% lifetime risk of a distal radius fracture; whereas a white man of the same age has a lifetime risk of a little over 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>). A prospective survey, conducted in six centres in the UK, of Colles' fracture in patients aged 35 years and above, reported the overall annual incidence of this fracture to be 9/10,000 in men and 37/10,000 in women (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>). In 2000, an incidence of 195 distal radius fractures per 100,000 adults was reported for the population (534,715 adults) served by the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 2006</LINK> reported that the average age of patients with these fractures was 56 years (46% were over 65 years) and that the male:female ratio was 31:69. However, this hides the bimodal distribution of the age data, with a cross-over of the two peaks of incidence at around 50 years of age; the second and higher peak being populated mainly by older women (<I>see </I>Figure 5 within <LINK REF="REF-Costa-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2015</LINK>). Distal radius fractures are usually treated on an outpatient basis, with around 20% of patients (mainly older people) requiring hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>). This percentage is likely to be underestimated given the increasing use of surgery and the ageing population (<LINK REF="REF-Nellans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nellans 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most fractures of the distal radius in older people result from low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing height or less. In younger adults, these injuries are usually sustained through high-energy trauma, such as a traffic accident. The pattern of incidence reflects the bone loss from osteoporosis in older people, as well as an increased number of falls by older women (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>These fractures are generally closed and usually involve displacement of fracture fragments. They may be either extra-articular (leaving the joint surface of the distal radius intact) or intra-articular (the joint surface is disrupted). Numerous classifications have been devised to define and group different fracture patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Chitnavis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitnavis 1999</LINK>). Simple classifications based on clinical appearance, and often named after those who described them, remain in common use. In particular, "Colles' fracture" is still the terminology used for a fracture in which there is an obvious and typical clinical deformity (commonly referred to as a 'dinner fork' deformity) of dorsal displacement, dorsal angulation, dorsal comminution (fragmentation), and radial shortening.</P>
<P>The majority of distal radial fractures are treated conservatively (non-operatively). This usually involves the reduction of the fracture if displaced, and forearm immobilisation in a plaster cast or brace for around six weeks. Surgical treatment usually involves either closed or open reduction, followed by external or internal fixation and a similar period of immobilisation. Since the last version of the review, there has been a marked increase in surgical intervention, particularly in the use of internal fixation using locking plates. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Mattila-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattila 2011</LINK> reported that the number of plate fixations for these fractures had more than doubled between 2006 and 2008 in Finland. Such clinical interventions (cast immobilisation and surgery followed by immobilisation) are often referred to as 'first definitive' treatments (<LINK REF="REF-HSCIC-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSCIC 2015</LINK>). Although in the following, we refer to these as 'definitive' treatments, this descriptor should not be taken to diminish the status of rehabilitation.</P>
<P>The variety of these 'definitive' treatment options is shown in the Cochrane reviews of conservative (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003c</LINK>) and surgical management of these fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>). The latter review is now replaced by reviews on different surgical methods, such as percutaneous pinning (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2007</LINK>), with the exception of internal fixation for which a review is underway (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>These injuries can result in increased morbidity, with long-term functional impairment, pain and deformity (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003c</LINK>). They are also associated with a high incidence of varied complications (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2001</LINK>); for example, serious complications, such as persistent neuropathies of the median, ulnar or radial nerves, have been reported in one in three patients (<LINK REF="REF-Cooney-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 1980</LINK>). One major complication is complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1), also referred to as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, algodystrophy, Sudeck's atrophy and shoulder-hand syndrome. Serious cases of CRPS-1 require many months of therapy to alleviate symptoms (pain, tenderness, impairment of joint mobility, swelling, dystrophy, vasomotor instability) (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-23 10:59:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rehabilitation refers to the overall process of helping people to make the best possible recovery from their injury. The issues surrounding the rehabilitation of patients with a distal radial fracture can be expressed in terms of four basic questions:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>What sort of intervention(s) should be used?</LI>
<LI>Who should provide them?</LI>
<LI>When and for how long?</LI>
<LI>Why?</LI>
</UL>
<P>A variety of interventions are available for use. Advice, patient education and supervision for active and passive mobilisation exercises, therapist-applied mobilisation techniques, continuous passive motion, strengthening exercises, supportive splints, physical methods of pain management such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), heat treatment, massage, wound care, manual aids and occupational/home assessment are some of the more common therapeutic methods used to maximise the patient's functional recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1993</LINK>). A small selection of these, commonly advice and mobility exercises, may be employed on a general basis for all patients. Usually though, interventions are selected and adapted by clinicians to meet the specific rehabilitation challenges presented by individual patients. Specific rehabilitation programmes of usually physical interventions (primarily exercises) based on a standardised protocol may also be applied; but, because it is not always possible to standardise to the last detail, some flexibility is common. Although drugs may be prescribed, for instance for pain relief, these are not reviewed here.</P>
<P>As well as the doctors, commonly orthopaedic surgeons, providing definitive treatment, other clinicians are often involved in the rehabilitation of patients with these injuries. These other clinicians may be physiotherapists, occupational therapists or nurses, many of whom are specialised in hand and/or upper limb therapy. The distinctions between the activities and roles of these clinicians often overlap and also vary geographically. Generally, physiotherapists aim to help the patient restore or achieve optimal movement and physical function. Occupational therapists share this aim but focus on helping patients to achieve independence in activities of daily living. Nurses may play a varied role, including that of rehabilitation, but plaster cast management and care of surgical wounds would be typical activities. These latter activities are viewed as part of clinical treatment for the purposes of this review.</P>
<P>The issue of when to commence rehabilitation is controversial. Rehabilitation could start as soon as possible after the injury and continue throughout, or rehabilitation could be seen as a subsequent stage in patient management and undertaken after the initial clinical treatment (e.g. cast immobilisation) is over. Therefore, the two key phases for management of these injuries are during initial clinical treatment, which usually involves immobilisation, and post-immobilisation (after plaster cast or external fixator removal). Upon receiving initial treatment, such as fracture reduction and application of a plaster cast, patients are usually given instructions to carry out straightforward exercises. These typically include elevation of the injured arm in the first few days post-injury and exercising of the non-immobilised joints in order to alleviate and/or counter swelling and stiffness. More extensive and intensive rehabilitation intervention is more frequent post-immobilisation; at this stage, limited range and quality of movement, reduced grip strength, and pain are typical reasons for initiating rehabilitation interventions.</P>
<P>The 'why' question mainly concerns the clinical indication for the intervention(s). Our main focus is on studying the effects of rehabilitation interventions on preventing complications associated with the fracture and/or treatment and on optimising functional recovery and achievement of activities required for daily living. Rehabilitation interventions may also be prescribed to treat complications, such as CRPS-1, of these fractures. We acknowledge the difficulties in distinguishing the two situations since there will be overlap but, given our main aim, we noted the reasons for starting or providing the interventions in individual trials. The aims, including intended trial populations, and the primary outcome(s) of individual trials helped us to distinguish between those trials evaluating interventions to resolve or prevent 'problems' and those investigating treatment options for complications. The latter are not included in this review. Similarly excluded are trials primarily investigating interventions for pain relief, acceleration of bone healing, osteoporosis or secondary prevention of fractures.</P>
<P>Editorial feedback for this version of the review prompted consideration of a possible fifth question: 'where'? Although pertinent, we decided against an additional category at this time because 'where should treatment take place?' is generally subsidiary to other questions when set in the context of the care pathway for these fractures. For example, the prime consideration of supervised rehabilitation versus home exercises resolves around the question of who provides rehabilitation (a clinician versus the patient) rather than care in a [hospital] clinic versus exercises at home. While we describe the locations of the interventions tested in the review, so far none of the comparisons is predominantly linked with locality. Nonetheless, this item will be reconsidered before the next version of the review.</P>

<P>Distal radius fractures are the, or among the, most common fractures in adults in predominantly white and older populations. These injuries can result in long-term functional impairment and pain, and are also associated with a high incidence and variety of complications. There is considerable variation in the management, including rehabilitation, of these fractures. The previous version of this review concluded that the available evidence from RCTs was insufficient to establish the relative effectiveness of the various interventions used in the rehabilitation of adults with these fractures, and also noted the paucity of the evidence for rehabilitation after surgical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2006</LINK>). This is an update of our systematic review of the evidence for rehabilitation interventions for these fractures.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-09-22 15:29:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To examine the effects of rehabilitation interventions in adults with conservatively or surgically treated distal radial fractures.</P>
<P>We defined the following specific objectives <I>a priori.</I>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>To compare the provision of rehabilitation intervention (of any kind) versus no intervention.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The rehabilitation intervention could be multi-component or involve a single modality (e.g. advice for home exercises) and, whilst available to all patients allocated the rehabilitation intervention, its application (use of specific modalities, extent) may vary according to the perceived needs of individual patients.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>To compare any type of rehabilitation intervention versus any other type of rehabilitation intervention.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>This covers comparisons of different rehabilitation interventions, either in different combinations of rehabilitation modalities or different single modalities. We considered the examination of variation in single modalities to be optional and that the inclusion of trials of any such comparisons was likely to be deferred until the use of the modality had been evaluated.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>To compare any method (context) of delivering or providing rehabilitation interventions versus any other method of delivering or providing rehabilitation interventions.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>This includes comparisons of supervised therapy versus home exercises, different methods of supervised therapy (e.g. individual versus group instruction), and the frequency and duration of rehabilitation (where rehabilitation is provided to all participants). It also includes comparisons of rehabilitation intervention when delivered by individual professionals with different levels or backgrounds of expertise or training. In the first instance, the various professions were grouped into four categories: doctors; non-specialist therapists; hand or upper limb clinical specialist therapists; and others (e.g. nurses).</LI>
</UL>
</OL>
<P>For each of these three comparisons we set up separate comparisons according to whether the rehabilitation intervention was provided during immobilisation or other definitive treatment, or post-immobilisation.</P>

<P>Pairs of review authors (current and former) independently assessed risk of bias for newly included trials, without masking of the source and authorship of the trial reports, and one author (HH) assessed risk of bias for trials that had been assessed in previous versions of the review. Between rater and between versions HH checked consistency in assessment at data entry. All inter-rater differences were resolved by discussion. We used the tool outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants and treatment providers, and outcome assessment), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias. We considered 'subjective' outcomes (e.g. patient-rated functional outcome scores, pain) and 'objective' outcomes (e.g. functional impairment, complications) separately in our assessment of blinding (performance bias). In our assessment of blinding (detection bias), we further split objective outcomes into those of functional impairment (e.g. grip strength) and the rest (e.g. complications). We considered short-term (up to three months follow-up) and longer-term (three months or longer follow-up) outcomes in our assessment of completeness of outcome data. We assessed two additional sources of bias: bias resulting from major imbalances in key baseline characteristics (e.g. age, gender, type of fracture, type of definitive treatment); and performance bias, particularly 'differential expertise' bias resulting from lack of comparability in clinician's experience with the interventions under test.</P>
<P>Additionally, we assessed five other aspects of trial design and reporting that would help us judge the applicability of the trial findings.

The physiotherapy was at the discretion of the physiotherapist. After instructions, the home exercise group received an exercise guidance book and training diary. This trial is considered to start post-immobilisation because the post-surgical splint was retained for one week after the start of therapy and was removed for therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Souer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Souer 2011</LINK> compared occupational therapy versus coaching for a programme of home exercises in 94 patients at the first post-operative visit to the surgeon's office after volar plate fixation.

<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gronlund-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gronlund 1990</LINK>) provided routine therapy during plaster cast immobilisation. <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK> evaluated "early therapeutic intervention" started within four days of injury and plaster cast application versus no intervention in 17 people. <LINK REF="STD-Gronlund-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gronlund 1990</LINK> compared the provision of "occupational therapy" one to three days after the application of a plaster cast to no provision in 40 participants. We considered pooling the data despite the differences between the interventions of these two trials. However, no data were available for pooling and so we have presented the results of the trials separately in the text below.</P>
<P>After plaster cast removal, one participant of the treatment group versus five participants in the control group of <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK> met the criteria for attendance of the hand therapy group classes (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>: risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 1.54). At four weeks post-immobilisation, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK> reported no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire scores (median: 22.50 versus 45.00 (higher scores = greater disability); reported P = 0.06) or time to perform the nine hole peg test (median: 19.00 versus 27.00 seconds; reported P = 0.12). This contrasts with the results of statistically significant differences between the two groups at four days post-immobilisation (median DASH scores: 46.00 versus 61.00, reported P = 0.02; median nine hole peg test time: 22.00 versus 48.00 seconds, reported P = 0.02). At four weeks post-immobilisation, the intervention group had statistically and clinically significantly better grip strength (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>: mean difference (MD) 7.28 kg, 95% CI 1.24 to 13.32 kg), and range of motion (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, supination: MD 18.33 degrees, 95% CI 6.41 to 30.25 degrees; extension: MD 10.94 degrees, 95% CI 0.80 to 21.08 degrees; ulnar deviation: MD 15.03 degrees, 95% CI 9.78 to 20.28 degrees). The difference in oedema was not statistically significant (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, any pain at rest: 0/8 versus 4/9, RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.99). <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK> reported there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the pain during activity (visual analogue scale (0 to 100 mm: higher scores = worse pain): median 25.50 versus 41.00, reported P = 0.63). Finger mobility was statistically significantly better in the early therapy group (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), perhaps reflecting the attention paid to finger exercises in this group. Three types of pinch grip were also reported to be statistically significantly better in the early therapy group (e.g. median 'tip pinch grip': 4.00 versus 2.25; reported P = 0.04). There were no cases of reflex sympathetic dystrophy.</P>
<P>Of the 17 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gronlund-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gronlund 1990</LINK> assigned to occupational therapy, 16 were provided with appliances, such as angled knives, and 10 were given home help. Plaster cast fitting problems were found in four participants and were resolved by a subsequent visit to the casualty ward. Nine occupational therapy participants were found not to have understood the core instructions for exercises and information provided by an occupational therapist to all trial participants after their initial treatment. Following plaster cast removal at five weeks, the functional scores (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1984</LINK>) of the 17 participants allocated to occupational therapy were reported as being statistically significantly better than those for the 23 participants in the group receiving no occupational therapy (median score 13 versus 18; reported P &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1984</LINK> based their functional grading scheme on <LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK> and graded 9 to 14 as "fair" and 15 and above as "poor". Wrist mobility also tended to be greater in the occupational therapy group (median percentage range of motion compared with unaffected wrist: 60% versus 50%; reported P = non-significant). However at three months, both groups had similar hand function (median functional score: 10 versus 9; reported P = non-significant) and wrist mobility (median relative mobility: 80% versus 80%). Similar numbers of participants in the two groups developed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>: 3/17 versus 2/23; RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.84). There were no cases of median or ulnar nerve compression or tendon rupture. All of the participants of the occupational therapy group who had been questioned expressed satisfaction with the intervention and indicated that they had not been inconvenienced. Control group participants were not asked about their understanding of the initial set of instructions, nor to rate satisfaction or convenience.

Using a modified Taiwanese version of the MAM-36 (45 to 190: best outcome), <LINK REF="STD-Kuo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kuo 2013</LINK> found no significant difference between the two groups at three, seven or 12 weeks (12 weeks: MD 8.30 favouring digit mobilisation, 95% CI -5.17 to 21.77; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

All participants in each of these trials received instructions for home exercises from either an occupational therapist (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>) or a physiotherapist (<LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>). We considered pooling despite the differences between the interventions of the four trials. However, no data were available for pooling and we have separately presented the results of the four trials in the text below.</P>
<P>No statistically significant differences were reported between the two groups in functional scores (<LINK REF="REF-Solgaard-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solgaard 1988</LINK> based on <LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>, at either three (median score: 8 versus 6) or nine months (median score: 3 versus 2). (In this functional grading scheme, Solgaard rated a grade of 0 to 2 as "excellent", 3 to 7 as "good" and 8 to 18 as "fair".) Grip strength was also similar in the two groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>) at the two follow-up times. Participants allocated occupational therapy attended an average of 37.5 therapy sessions (range 22 to 90 sessions), of overall duration averaging 11.4 hours (range 6 to 22 hours). No participants in the control group received occupational therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK> found that while the baseline patient characteristics of the two groups were generally comparable, the participants allocated physiotherapy were more "symptomatic", with significantly reduced wrist extension (median: 15 versus 25 degrees; reported P = 0.03), and tendencies to poorer pronation (P = 0.05), supination (P = 0.06) and ulnar deviation (P = 0.08). (Adjustments were made for multiple testing throughout the analysis of this trial). The trialists considered that the outcome in both groups at 12 weeks follow-up was acceptable with no statistically significant differences between the two groups found for any of the six range of movement measures, the functional status scores (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1993</LINK>), pain scores or grip strength. This suggests a trend to a greater improvement over time from a more unfavourable starting position in the physiotherapy group; as reported by <LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>. In the light of the differences observed at baseline, the findings of an "Area under the curve" analysis, which included the results from the baseline, at four weeks, and where available, at 12 weeks for 81 of the 98 participants, were presented. There were no statistically significant differences in the outcome measures aside from supination which was significantly better in the control group (adjusted P = 0.04); this reflected the better baseline scores for this outcome measure in the control group, which persisted throughout follow-up. Similar numbers of participants in the two groups developed complications: reflex sympathetic dystrophy (two versus three) and carpal tunnel syndrome (two versus two). Five of these participants (four with CRPS-1; one with carpal tunnel syndrome) were excluded from 12-weeks follow up; and complications (one CRPS-1; one carpal tunnel syndrome) developed in two physiotherapy group participants at the end of the study. The median duration of treatment for participants allocated physiotherapy was 35 days (range 1 to 142 days) and the median number of contacts was three (range 1 to 16). Four physiotherapy participants were referred to occupational therapy. None of the control group participants retained in the trial received physiotherapy or occupational therapy, aside from the advice and instructions given initially to all trial participants.</P>

<P>As above, the final outcome assessment for <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK> preceded the last treatment session on the fifth day. The results for pain, oedema (volume) and range of motion are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>. In these, the results for two intervention groups (PEMF plus ice; sham PEMF plus ice) were combined for the ice group, and the results of the two intervention groups (PEMF; sham PEMF) were combined for the control group. Pain was statistically significantly less in the combined ice groups (visual analogue scale: MD -0.82 cm, 95% -1.33 to -0.31 cm). In contrast, extension was significantly better in the control groups (MD -8.89 degrees, 95% CI -13.57 to -4.21 degrees). This, however, should be seen in the context of the significantly higher baseline extension mean value for the control groups: this was 8.44 degrees greater than that of the combined ice groups. Differences between the two groups in the other outcome measures were not statistically significant. There were no adverse effects recorded.</P>

<P>The combined intervention was compared with sham PEMF alone in 39 participants of <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>. The results for pain, oedema (volume) and range of motion at the final assessment on the fifth day are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK>. Only the differences between the two groups in extension in favour of the control group (MD -9.20 degrees, 95% CI -16.79 to -1.61 degrees), and ulnar deviation in favour of the combined intervention group (MD 3.80 degrees, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.95 degrees) were statistically significant. Again, the more favourable result in the control group for extension may reflect the significantly higher baseline extension mean value for this group (this was 11.6 degrees higher than that of the combined intervention group). There were no adverse effects recorded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Passive mobilisation</HEADING>
<P>Though the format and context of the passive mobilisation differed considerably in the two trials investigating this modality (<LINK REF="STD-Kay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1994</LINK>), there are sufficient similarities, including the declared experience of the physiotherapists involved, in the two trials to consider pooling. In the event, this was only possible for one outcome (number of treatments). However, pooling revealed highly statistically significant heterogeneity. We decided in this update not to pool these results but to present the results of the two trials separately (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-012.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results of <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2000</LINK> were unavailable for one person, who withdrew because he found passive mobilisation too uncomfortable. Of the 39 participants remaining, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups at six weeks for grip strength (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>), range of motion (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-012.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.2</LINK>), web space angle (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-012.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.3</LINK>), finger movements (flexor deficit: reported P &gt; 0.25; extensor deficit: reported P &gt; 0.39) or visual analogue pain scores (0: no pain to 10: worst imaginable; median scores extracted from graph 1.25 versus 1.0; reported P = 0.63). Likewise no statistically significant differences between the groups were reported for subjective disability: visual analogue scores (0: no difficulty to 10: extreme difficulty; median scores extracted from graph: 2 versus 2; reported P = 0.43); or in the performance of six functional tests (reported P &gt; 0.18); most participants were able to perform the latter without difficulty at six weeks. The four participants in the passive mobilisation group with complications present at six weeks had been treated conservatively: two had carpal tunnel syndrome; one had complex regional pain syndrome, ongoing from the start of the trial; and one participant had a malunited fracture. One osteoporotic participant in the control group who had received pins and plaster had unresolved finger stiffness at six weeks. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the numbers of participants with complications at six weeks (4/19 versus 1/20; RR 4.21, 95% CI 0.52 to 34.37; P = 0.18; analysis not shown). Participants allocated passive mobilisation received on average six more treatments than those in the control group (MD 5.90, 95% CI 5.40 to 6.40; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-012.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.5</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2000</LINK> calculated that the mean total of hospital reimbursement, based on 1997 to 1998 costs, was nearly three times greater for the passive mobilisation group (AUD 457 versus AUD 161).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1994</LINK>, discharge from physiotherapy, at an average of 26 days, was at the discretion of physiotherapists, who based their decision on an acceptable range of motion or an assessment that no further benefit from therapy was to be expected. Participants receiving passive mobilisation tended to have slightly more treatment and took longer to be considered ready for discharge, but neither result was statistically significant (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-012.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-012.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.6</LINK>). There was no statistically or clinically significant difference between participants receiving passive mobilisation and those receiving soft tissue massage (control group) in wrist extension at end of therapy (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-012.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.4</LINK>: MD -2.14 degrees, 95% CI -10.44 to 6.16 degrees). <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1994</LINK> reported that subgroup analyses looking at wrist extensions attained by both groups of participants treated by three out of the four therapists involved showed no significant differences. They suggested that this finding showed that no one therapist was more proficient at applying passive joint mobilisation.</P>

<P>Data for three participants, excluded due to CRPS-1, psychiatric hospitalisation and death, were not provided in <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 1993</LINK>. It is also likely that nine of the remaining 40 participants were unavailable for outcome assessment at three months. <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 1993</LINK> reported that grip strength and the various measures of movement tended to be better in the group given intermittent pneumatic compression at the start of each session of occupational therapy. However, only the results for wrist extension were statistically significantly better in the compression group (median 58 degrees versus 45 degrees; reported P &lt; 0.05). A similarly non-statistically significant tendency for less pain at rest and during function was reported for the compression group. No reduction in oedema could be demonstrated for either group of participants. Only a few participants in each group (numbers not stated) were considered to require further occupational therapy after three weeks.</P>

Based on persistent radiocarpal pain and delayed recovery of hand function, fewer ultrasound participants were referred for physiotherapy at eight weeks (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-013.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.2</LINK>: 2/19 versus 8/19; RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.03).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Whirlpool</HEADING>
<P>It was not clear whether any participants were excluded from <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 1986</LINK> because of lack of improvement or deterioration in their condition. Also unclear is how many participants stopped treatment before the scheduled 12 sessions, and whether early curtailment was instigated by the therapist or the patient. By the end of treatment, at a maximum of six weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between those participants whose affected forearm was immersed in a whirlpool or wrapped in two towels (control group) in grip strength, pain or forearm and wrist range of motion (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-014.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-014.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.3</LINK>). Although, as seen in <LINK REF="CMP-014.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.4</LINK>, finger flexion tended to be worse in the whirlpool group, and statistically significantly worse for flexion of the long finger (MD -7.50 degrees, 95% CI -13.52 to -1.48 degrees), <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 1986</LINK> questioned the clinical significance of these results. Follow-up immediately after the session (whirlpool or towel) revealed a statistically significantly higher oedema in the whirlpool group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-014.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.5</LINK>: MD 72.92 mL, 95% CI 5.89 to 139.95 mL), without statistically significant differences in strength, pain, or forearm and wrist range of motion. Long-term oedema was not statistically significant between the two groups (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-014.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.5</LINK>). Participants were reported as finding the whirlpool comfortable and pleasant; no comments from the towel group were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 1986</LINK> referred to whirlpool baths as being an "expensive modality" but did not quantify costs.</P>

The results, however, did not differ importantly from the per-protocol analyses reported in the main report. <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK> found no statistically or clinically significant differences between the dynamic splint and control group in the PRWE results at the end of the eight weeks treatment (MD -0.87%, 95% CI -7.43% to 5.59%) nor one month subsequently (MD 3.57%, 95% CI -3.18% to 10.32%; <I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>). Similar findings applied at 12 weeks to the results of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (<I>see </I>

<LINK REF="CMP-015.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.3</LINK>). There were two adverse events reported in relation to the use of dynamic splints: transient numbness in index finger and pain during stretch. Both resolved when the splints were modified. Repairs were required for two other splints. All four participants were without their splints for between one to 13 days. Fourteen participants provided data on their splint use; this showed that most participants did not wear their splints for the recommended six hours a day and that there were days when participants did not wear their splint at all. While adherence to exercises was poorly recorded in the participants' personal diaries, <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK> reported that there was no indication of a systematic difference between the two groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 17:34:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We set out to determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for adults with conservatively or surgically treated distal radial fractures. This encompassed the four basic questions stated in the 'Background': essentially, what interventions should be provided, by whom, when and for how long, and why? The variation in interventions, providers, timing, definitive treatment and patient characteristics makes this a complex and extensive area to review. We restricted the evidence to that from RCTs or quasi-RCTs since these are generally less susceptible to systematic bias, specifically selection bias, than other study designs. Inevitably this has reduced the quantity of available evidence with only 26 small trials involving 1269 participants included so far. A further limitation is that only four of the 23 comparisons covered by these 26 trials were evaluated by more than one trial. Despite clearly different characteristics of trials testing essentially the same comparisons, pooling of trial results was nevertheless considered but, even in the very few cases where there were comparable outcomes, was not done.</P>
<P>The results for each of the 23 comparisons are summarised in five tables that present the evidence available for the following categories (Tables 5 to 9). The entry for each comparison in the tables presents the question asked (PICO), a summary of the results (Findings), an assessment of the quality of the evidence with reasons for downgrading (GRADE), and a note on the assessment of applicability based on five questions (<I>see </I>

<P>It is noteworthy that with two exceptions, which are rated as low quality, the evidence for all comparisons has been rated as very low quality; both ratings indicate considerable uncertainty in the findings. Such ratings are almost inevitable where the evidence is derived from small, often methodologically flawed trials conducted in single centres with one or very few clinicians providing the intervention(s) under test.</P>
<P>It is instructive to consider the evidence staged by timing of the rehabilitation intervention rather than stick rigidly to the six comparisons above. As well as reflecting clinical context, this approach is taken because the structure of the review, which reflects the best categorisation of the often complex questions addressed in the individual trials, can lose sight of the other questions being addressed, in particular relating to the provision of these usually complex interventions. This restructuring, however, does not give rise to any new opportunities for pooling. The numbers of participants given below relate to the numbers for whom results were available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rehabilitation during the definitive treatment period</HEADING>
<P>The evidence available for rehabilitation starting during the definitive treatment period is summarised in two tables (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>); there being no trials comparing different rehabilitation interventions.</P>
<P>Two comparisons tested the provision of therapy provided by a rehabilitation specialist versus instructions only, in one comparison instructions were given by an orthopaedic surgeon, during cast immobilisation. One trial (17 participants) of the two trials in the first comparison provided very low quality evidence of a better hand function after hand therapy four days after plaster cast removal, with some beneficial effects continuing one month later (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK>). The other trial (40 participants) of this comparison found very low quality evidence of improved hand function in the short-term, but not in the longer-term (three months), for early occupational therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gronlund-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gronlund 1990</LINK>). The second comparison of physiotherapist-supervised exercise therapy versus instruction for the same exercises by an orthopaedic surgeon alone provided very low quality evidence of there being no difference in outcome between the two approaches (95 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Pasila-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pasila 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials separately provided very low quality evidence of potential but limited benefits restricted to one or two measures of impairment of single interventions applied in addition to standard care (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). These aimed to counter well-known problems, such as finger stiffness and loss of grip strength, of cast immobilisation and to improve recovery. Two were provided in the clinic (early digit mobilisation during external fixation (22 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Kuo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kuo 2013</LINK>); and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) during cast immobilisation (60 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Lazovic-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lazovic 2012</LINK>)) and two were applied at home after instructions (cyclic pneumatic soft tissue compression using an inflatable cuff placed under the plaster cast (19 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Challis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Challis 2007</LINK>); cross-education during cast immobilisation with or without surgical repair (39 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Magnus-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Magnus 2013</LINK>)). The very low quality and thus unreliable evidence on measures of functional impairment (e.g. grip strength) was available from the four small trials testing these interventions that, even where suggestive of potential yet limited benefit, should not be used to support their use in practice without further research.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rehabilitation started post-immobilisation</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the evidence for rehabilitation applied to the post-immobilisation period. This is summarised in three tables (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>); and includes three comparisons of different rehabilitation interventions (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). As above, the comparisons can be split into those relating to the provision of therapy and those of single interventions.</P>
<P>Seven comparisons tested the provision or format of therapy after post-immobilisation. The composition and extent of rehabilitation therapy provided by a rehabilitation specialist (usually physiotherapist or occupational therapist) varied considerably. The least of the interventions was a single session of physiotherapy, primarily advice and instructions for a home exercise programme, compared with 'no intervention' after cast removal (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). One trial (47 participants) found very low quality evidence in favour of the single session of physiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK>). The intervention group of <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK> is similar to the 'control' group of the four heterogenous trials (75, 30, 33 and 66 participants) in the comparison of the routine provision of physiotherapy or occupational therapy in addition to instructions for home exercises versus instructions for home exercises from a therapist (<LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>). As summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>, none of the trials found a clinically significant effect of the routine provision of rehabilitation therapy post-immobilisation, but the available evidence is low quality. The limited and very low quality evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Watt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2000</LINK> (16 participants), which compared routine physiotherapy (average five sessions) versus instructions for home exercises by an orthopaedic surgeon after cast immobilisation, was in favour of physiotherapy (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>), as was the very low quality evidence from the comparison of physiotherapy versus a home exercise programme following cast immobilisation tested by <LINK REF="STD-Bighea-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bighea 2013</LINK> (20 participants; <I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). Both trials (46 and 76 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Krischak-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krischak 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Souer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Souer 2011</LINK>) comparing physiotherapy or occupational therapy versus a progressive home exercise programme after volar plate fixation provided low quality evidence in favour of a structured programme of home exercises preceded by instructions or coaching (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). The last comparison of this group evaluated accelerated versus usual rehabilitation after volar plate fixation. There was very low quality evidence (63 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Brehmer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Brehmer 2014</LINK>) of some potentially early benefit in DASH scores with accelerated rehabilitation that did not persist.</P>
<P>The other 11 comparisons were of specific interventions in addition to standard care (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). Six trials provided very low quality evidence on interventions that were applied following cast immobilisation, that had sometimes incorporated wires or pins: PEMF (83 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>), ice (83 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>), PEMF plus ice (39 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>), PEMF versus ice (44 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>), passive mobilisation (69 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1994</LINK>), intermittent pneumatic compression (31 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 1993</LINK>), ultrasound (38 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Basso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Basso 1998</LINK>) and immersion of the forearm in a whirlpool (24 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 1986</LINK>). One trial provided very low quality evidence on continuous passive motion applied post-external fixation (7 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Rozencwaig-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rozencwaig 1996</LINK>), and two trials provided very low quality evidence on interventions that were applied after either cast immobilisation or surgery: dynamic extension splint (40 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK>), and manual oedema mobilisation versus traditional oedema treatment (29 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Knygsand_x002d_Roenhoej-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Knygsand-Roenhoej 2011</LINK>). These trials provided very low quality evidence of a lack of clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving passive mobilisation, ice or PEMF or both these interventions, whirlpool immersion, or dynamic extension splint for patients with wrist contracture, compared with no intervention. This finding applied also to the two trials comparing PEMF versus ice and manual oedema mobilisation versus traditional oedema treatment. There was very low quality evidence of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion post-external fixation, intermittent pneumatic compression and ultrasound therapy.</P>

<P>The evidence available for this review of 26 small trials is very limited, primarily because the evidence for 19 comparisons is derived solely from individual trials and that no pooling was possible for the four comparisons tested by up to a maximum of four trials. Further inadequacies arise from the limitations in outcome measurement, including the frequent lack of validated patient-reported outcome measures of wrist function, short follow-up periods, and incomplete reporting of results for some trials.</P>

<P>As well as providing comprehensive details of the study populations and interventions in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> shows our assessments for each trial of five aspects of relevance to ascertaining external validity: definition of the study population; description of the interventions; definition of primary outcome measures; relevance of outcome measurement and length of follow-up. Clearly unhelpful are incomplete descriptions of study inclusion (eight trials, of which one gave a very inadequate description (<LINK REF="STD-Bighea-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bighea 2013</LINK>)) and interventions (12 trials of which four gave a very inadequate description of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Krischak-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krischak 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozencwaig-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rozencwaig 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Souer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Souer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>)). However, the trials that did not give full descriptions of their interventions were generally those testing multi-component interventions (e.g. physiotherapy: <LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2000</LINK>) where the interventions were partly or wholly left to the discretion of the therapists. Attempts to standardise were made in some of these more pragmatic trials, which attempt to reflect normal practice (<LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2000a</LINK>). However, normal practice can vary and there is also the possibility of confounding due to variation in the intervention. The description of the main outcomes was judged insufficient in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bighea-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bighea 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>) and inadequate in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rozencwaig-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rozencwaig 1996</LINK>). The clinical relevance of reported outcomes, which was mainly based on the reporting of patient-reported outcome measures, was considered only partially relevant in 12 trials and very inadequate in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rozencwaig-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rozencwaig 1996</LINK>). Length of follow-up was considered inadequate in 19 trials. This points to a general failing of the included trials as the short follow-up means that the time was insufficient to ascertain functional recovery fully. In particular, the follow-up of patients to when they are discharged rather than at set times can be administratively convenient but could be a source of serious bias. Another very inadequate approach, taken by <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>, is the timing of final assessment before the time of last treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Further comments on applicability of trial populations</HEADING>
<P>The types of participants eligible for the individual comparisons are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>. When judging applicability, the definitive treatment (plaster cast immobilisation, internal fixation) and timing in the care pathway (during definitive treatment, post-immobilisation) are key characteristics. It is notable that this update now includes two trials where the definitive treatment was internal fixation (<LINK REF="STD-Brehmer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Brehmer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Souer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Souer 2011</LINK>); this reflects the growing, although not strongly evidenced, use of this intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Koval-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koval 2008</LINK>). For some trials, however, the study population was further restricted as the trial participants had been referred to physiotherapy (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 1986</LINK>). While trials aimed at the treatment of complications such as CRPS-1 were not included in this review (<I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>), participants in <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK> had wrist contracture and those in <LINK REF="STD-Knygsand_x002d_Roenhoej-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Knygsand-Roenhoej 2011</LINK> had subacute oedema. The actual trial populations were generally representative in terms of key patient characteristics. Thus most participants were female and middle aged or older (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The description of fracture characteristics was usually limited but this aspect is far less critical than in trials of definitive treatment. Notably, half of the trials explicitly excluded patients with serious, usually confirmed, complications (seven explicitly excluded CRPS-1) or comorbidities, or both.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Further comments on applicability of trial interventions</HEADING>
<P>Evaluation of rehabilitation interventions is difficult to do well. These are generally complex interventions with considerable variation in practice including the often adaptive nature of rehabilitation, where treatment is varied according to the perceived needs and progress of individual patients. These problems are addressed to some extent by pragmatic trials, which aim to evaluate the effects of interventions in real clinical situations, but as explained above, additional problems may result.</P>
<P>An important confounder reflects the personal aspect of these studies; for example, the inter-personal skills of the care provider(s) and motivation of the trial participants could influence the results considerably. There is also the reactive nature of many of these interventions where the basis for progression of, or modification to, the intervention, as well as the timing of completion, is discretionary. The criteria for progression and discharge in most of the included trials were discretionary and though some prior consensus was evident in some of these trials, the criteria were not very specific and could be a major source of variation. For example, participants in <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK> attended a minimum of 22 therapy sessions, whereas this was the maximum number in <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>; yet in both trials the criteria for discharge was basically when the therapist considered no further progress could be made. This highlights that both the immediate and ultimate clinical relevance of the criteria used need to be examined and resolved. Related to this is the reminder in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1994</LINK> that an improvement over the treatment session, as assessed by a therapist, is "of lesser clinical consequence if this improvement is not transferred to a greater rate of improvement over the rehabilitation programme", or indeed in ultimate outcome.</P>
<P>There are also limitations of interpreting comparisons of multi-component interventions: it is impossible to derive the optimal format of the intervention or the relative effectiveness of its individual components. Changes in definitive treatment may also affect the applicability of the trial results: for instance, in the duration and form of immobilisation, or selection of patients for surgery. The identity of the care provider can also impinge on outcomes as the roles of separate professions, such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists, vary in time and place, but can overlap to a great extent (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Applicability of the evidence relating to individual comparisons</HEADING>
<P>As above, the evidence is presented split by rehabilitation started during the definitive treatment period and rehabilitation started post-immobilisation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rehabilitation during the definitive treatment period</HEADING>
<P>The evidence available for rehabilitation starting during the definitive treatment period is summarised in two tables (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>); there being no trials comparing different rehabilitation interventions.</P>
<P>A key observation relating to the two comparisons testing the provision of specialist therapy during cast immobilisation is that the control group (instructions for self care and exercises during cast immobilisation) of both comparisons points to a minimum of care that is and should be provided. Other observations are the differences in actual interventions constituting formal therapy and the patient populations. One of the two trials finding in favour of the additional formal therapy tested occupational therapy in an older population (<LINK REF="STD-Gronlund-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gronlund 1990</LINK>), whose specific needs may well be greater than the far younger population of <LINK REF="STD-Pasila-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Pasila 1974</LINK>, which did not find additional benefit from supervised exercise.</P>
<P>Very low quality and thus unreliable evidence was available from the four small trials each testing one of four interventions in addition to standard care. These interventions were early digit mobilisation during external fixation, PEMF during cast immobilisation, cyclic pneumatic soft tissue compression using an inflatable cuff during cast immobilisation, and cross-education during cast immobilisation with or without surgical repair. When considering whether further research on these specific interventions is warranted, there needs to be assessment of the practical and cost aspects of the intervention and patient acceptability. For example, the intensive nature and potential costs of implementation of the early digit mobilisation intervention (18 sessions of 45 minutes duration over six weeks) tested in <LINK REF="STD-Kuo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kuo 2013</LINK> means that, particularly given the lack of evidence of a clinically important effect of this intervention, further research on this should not be prioritised.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rehabilitation started post-immobilisation</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the evidence for rehabilitation applied to the post-immobilisation period. This is summarised in three tables (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>); and include three comparisons of different rehabilitation interventions (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). As above, the comparisons can be split into those relating to the provision of therapy and those of specific interventions.</P>
<P>Seven comparisons tested the provision or format of therapy after post-immobilisation. The composition and extent of rehabilitation therapy provided by a rehabilitation specialist (usually physiotherapist or occupational therapist) varied considerably. The least of the interventions was a single session of physiotherapy, primarily advice and instructions for a home exercise programme, compared with 'no intervention' after cast removal tested in <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK> (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). However, the 'control' group of <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK> should not be considered as 'no intervention' as at least some advice would have been provided during cast immobilisation and probably at cast removal. This is still distinct from the systematic advice provided by a rehabilitation specialist who also would have adapted their instructions and exercises where complications were detected. Secondly, the trial involved follow-up assessment at three and six weeks by a rehabilitation specialist that did at minimum allow screening for complications in both groups. As noted above, the intervention group of <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK> is similar to the 'control' group of the four heterogenous trials in the second comparison listed in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. This compared the routine provision of physiotherapy or occupational therapy in addition to instructions for home exercises versus instructions for home exercises from a therapist. Where described the provision of therapy, such as the marked difference in the average attendance between <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK> and the other three trials (e.g. mean 37 sessions in <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK> and 4.4 in <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK>), varied considerably in the four trials. The poor description of the interventions hampers the applicability of both <LINK REF="STD-Watt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2000</LINK>, which compared routine physiotherapy (average 5 sessions) versus instructions for home exercises by an orthopaedic surgeon after cast immobilisation, and <LINK REF="STD-Bighea-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bighea 2013</LINK>, which compared physiotherapy versus a home exercise programme post-cast immobilisation, but as in the previous comparison, a minimum of instructions for home exercises is established. In both trials comparing physiotherapy or occupational therapy versus a progressive home exercise programme after volar plate fixation, there was no mention of home exercises in the supervised therapy group, which is unlikely to reflect usual care. The last comparison of this group evaluated accelerated versus usual rehabilitation after volar plate fixation. There was very low quality evidence of some potentially early benefit in DASH scores that, however, did not persist. In terms of applicability, a particular drawback in the trial evaluating accelerated versus usual rehabilitation after volar plate fixation is the later stoppage time for use of splints and lack of information on advice for home exercises for the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Brehmer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Brehmer 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other 11 comparisons were of single interventions in addition to standard care (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). The intensity of the interventions ranged from a single five-minute session of ultrasound applied in the clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Basso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Basso 1998</LINK>) to a six-hour daily application over eight weeks at home of a dynamic wrist splint (<LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK>). Similar observations apply to these interventions as to specific interventions applied during the definitive treatment period. Again, only very low quality and thus unreliable evidence was available from the small trials testing these interventions that, even where suggestive of potential yet limited benefit, should not be used to support their use in practice without further research. Additionally, when considering whether further research on these specific interventions is warranted, there needs to be assessment of the practical and cost aspects of the intervention and patient acceptability. In this case, the inconvenient and demanding nature of the dynamic wrist splint programme, which was poorly adhered to and considered intrusive by some participants, tested in <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK> means that, particularly given the lack of evidence of a clinically important effect of this intervention, further research on this should not be prioritised.</P>

<P>The evidence base for this review, formed from 26 small heterogeneous trials, is very limited. As well as in size, the majority of the included trials had methodological shortcomings and were at high risk of bias, usually related to lack of blinding, that could affect the validity of their findings (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). There is clearly a need for caution in interpreting the results of small trials which demonstrate 'no evidence of an effect' rather than 'evidence of no effect'.

The evidence was typically downgraded one or two levels for study limitations, one or two levels for imprecision and occasionally one level for indirectness.

<P>Although our search strategy was comprehensive and without language or publication restrictions, it is very likely that we have missed some trials and findings. In particular, there may be trials that were only reported at conferences, or mixed population trials that included, but did not highlight, patients with wrist fractures. We also point out that pursuing and obtaining unpublished trials and materials is very time-consuming and can be frustrating for both review and trial authors. We are very grateful to all the people who have provided additional information and trial materials.</P>
<P>Three aspects of study selection warrant mention. The first applies to the exclusion of three trials that previously we had or would have left awaiting classification. In the unlikely event that further information, such as a full report of the final results (<LINK REF="STD-Lohstrater-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lohstrater 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodbridge-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodbridge 2003</LINK>) or clarification of methods and results (<LINK REF="STD-Naik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Naik 2007</LINK>), becomes available we will assess their inclusion in a future update. The second applies to the inclusion of trials whose participants were restricted to those with symptoms, such as of wrist contracture (<LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK>) or subacute oedema (<LINK REF="STD-Knygsand_x002d_Roenhoej-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Knygsand-Roenhoej 2011</LINK>). These symptoms are commonplace for patients with these fractures and are likely to have been part of the reason for referral for physiotherapy in other trials. These trials are distinct from excluded trials that either reported only outcomes relating to these symptoms or that focussed on treating complications such as CRPS after wrist fracture. The third relates to the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Brehmer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Brehmer 2014</LINK>, which investigated the timing of the start of physiotherapy after volar plate fixation. This acceleration of physiotherapy differs from those trials, which were not eligible, that tested duration of immobilisation after surgery.</P>

<P>The broad scope of this review with its specific focus on rehabilitation after distal radius fractures continues to be unique. There are systematic reviews that cover specific interventions or comparisons for these fractures or for mixed populations that may or may not include distal radius fractures. Rather than a comprehensive summary of these, a couple of examples are provided here.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Valdes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdes 2014</LINK> aimed to compare the effectiveness of a home programme versus a structured therapy programme for patients following distal radius fracture. All seven trials included in <LINK REF="REF-Valdes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdes 2014</LINK> are included in our review but appear under separate comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krischak-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krischak 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Souer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Souer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Valdes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdes 2014</LINK> illustrates our point above that the evidence can be repackaged to address other questions. Nonetheless, they also noted the insufficiency of the evidence from these seven trials, when considered together, to answer their question. A key consideration developed in <LINK REF="REF-Valdes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdes 2014</LINK> was the representativeness of the study populations, in particular with regard to the inclusion of patients with complications and comorbidities. Although we had already considered this aspect in previous versions of our review, it was in a less formal way and we have now drawn greater attention, as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, to the fact that the majority of the included trials excluded patients with serious complications, in particular CRPS-1, or comorbidities more common in older (&gt; 65 years) patients. However, after definitive treatment, especially cast immobilisation, signs and symptoms such as finger stiffness and swelling are commonplace and it is very likely that patients with these 'complications' were included in most trials investigating interventions at this stage; the exclusions reflecting severe cases with specific, even if still tentative, diagnoses. Related to this are observations in <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK> of an inherent advantage of their study design that facilitated early detection of complications via assessment by a physiotherapist at cast removal and at three and six weeks follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK> argued that many of these detected "complications may have been overlooked or have had delayed diagnosis if it were not for the study protocol". Given the high complication rate of these fractures, the finding of a difference between patients and physicians in assessing complications of these fractures by <LINK REF="REF-McKay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2001</LINK> adds support to the assertion made by <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2008</LINK>. Finally, in terms of the description of interventions, <LINK REF="REF-Valdes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdes 2014</LINK> noted that only <LINK REF="STD-Krischak-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krischak 2009</LINK> referred to a handout that helped guide home exercises.</P>
<P>The second review highlighted here is <LINK REF="REF-Katalinic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katalinic 2010</LINK>, which investigated the effects of stretch on contractures in people with, or at risk of, contractures. <LINK REF="REF-Katalinic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katalinic 2010</LINK> concluded that for all conditions, including people with non-neurological conditions, there is "little or no effect of stretch on pain, spasticity, activity limitation, participation restriction or quality of life". As observed in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Jongs-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jongs 2012</LINK> that dynamic splints are unlikely to be therapeutic are consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Katalinic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katalinic 2010</LINK>. Several single modality interventions tested for distal radius fractures will have more general applicability and so while this review is purposefully on the rehabilitation of this very common and often problematic fracture, it is very likely that the results from reviews of these modalities on related conditions can help to inform practice should sufficient evidence be available.</P>

<P>There remains insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine how best to manage the rehabilitation of adults with fractures of the distal radius. Thus the evidence is insufficient to establish exactly what rehabilitation intervention is necessary to optimise functional recovery, or what type of rehabilitation specialists should provide this care, or when or for how long this care should be provided, or in what circumstances it should be provided.</P>
<P>The findings of this review should not be construed as a basis for the non-provision of any rehabilitation intervention for people with these injuries. Clearly, general advice and instruction on mobilisation should be given to all patients with these fractures. This is supported also by our assessment of the control groups and standard care provided to all participants of the included trials. There is also a case, albeit based on very low quality evidence, for the specialist assessment and tailored advice and instruction for home exercises soon after cast removal. Although patients with serious complications or comorbidities were excluded in many of the included trials, it is also clear that additional therapy will be necessary for patients with complications or serious functional impairment. Whilst many people with these fractures will make a satisfactory recovery, it should be remembered that the consequences of a bad outcome might include disabling pain (<LINK REF="REF-Fisk-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisk 1991</LINK>), loss of independence (<LINK REF="REF-Scaf_x002d_Klomp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scaf-Klomp 2001</LINK>) and that, for many patients, these fractures indicate an increased risk of further fracture in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Senanayake-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senanayake 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2010</LINK> showed that these fractures contribute to clinically important functional decline in older women (age &gt; 65 years).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-22 15:21:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is warranted to identify effective rehabilitation interventions for these common fractures in adults. This is supported too by a research prioritisation exercise, conducted in 2003 and informed by the evidence available in Cochrane reviews at that time, that established three priority research areas to identify what rehabilitation interventions should be given a) during and b) post-immobilisation for conservatively treated fractures and "what are good (practical and effective) ways of (routinely) delivering rehabilitative interventions?" (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003b</LINK>). Research on rehabilitation interventions was also identified in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons distal radius fracture guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.aaos.org/Research/guidelines/DRFguideline.asp">AAOS 2009</A>). This highlighted research on "physical therapy (e.g. early formal physical therapy, self supervised home programs)". However, the identification of priority questions for research requires further refinement and such an exercise should take into account the current coverage of the evidence, including the topics covered in the ongoing trials, current practice and differences in practice, and should involve consultation with patients as to their preferences and values. Achieving professional consensus on treatment uncertainties should facilitate sufficient recruitment into multicentre trials and also implementation of their findings.</P>
<P>As before, we consider that a priority area is an examination of the provision, mode and format of advice and instruction for home exercises, both during the definitive treatment period, and post-immobilisation. Research would also be worthwhile to identify interim and intermediate functional outcomes, which correlate with long-term outcome and which can be used to indicate the need for more extensive rehabilitation, and act as criteria for progressing and discharging people from rehabilitation. These research aims need good quality, generally applicable evidence from methodologically sound and sufficiently powered RCTs, preferably multi-centred. These trials require easily applied standardised materials, comprehensive assessment of outcome with the use of validated measures, and long-term follow-up.</P>
<P>Consideration should also be given to the potential differences in impact of rehabilitation in different participant groups and circumstances. This includes older people with comorbidities and who are at greater risk of functional decline.</P>

<P>Timing of intervention: following initial treatment of fracture in a split cast. Allocation was at a mean of 9.4 days after fracture. The split cast was replaced with a full forearm plaster, worn for 5 weeks. All participants had an inflatable cuff positioned around their forearm under their plaster with the valve of the cuff protruding through the cast. Both groups were instructed to actively make a fist 100 times per day during the immobilisation period. All participants had a total of 6 weeks immobilisation.<BR/>1. Cyclic pneumatic soft tissue compression for 5 weeks. Participants were provided with a compression pump apparatus to use at home and received instructions on its use. The apparatus consisted of a compression pump connected to an inflatable cuff positioned around the proximal forearm flexor and extensor muscle bulk under the plaster. The compression pump was designed to pump air into a reservoir and, at set time periods, release a pressurised volume of air into the inflatable cuff. One inflation/deflation of the cuff took 10 seconds and 60 compressions were applied per treatment session. The cyclic pneumatic pressure was applied twice per day (morning and evening) taking ten minutes for each session. After piloting on two cases, the pressurising period of 3.5 seconds was chosen on the basis that it did not produce any pain at the fracture site</P>

Gentle forearm/wrist/hand strengthening exercises, including grip exercise, were added from week 3. Participants were asked to demonstrate the exercises to the physiotherapist and were instructed to continue the programme at home. A booklet outlining advice and illustrating the exercises was provided. Participants were also fitted with an elastic threaded cotton sleeve for wrist and forearm for swelling control and comfort and instructed on its application and precautions.

<BR/>1. Modified 'manual edema mobilization' (MEM) consists of a specific massage technique aimed at promoting the flow of lymph, exercises, exercises during the massage sequence, deep diaphragm breathing, a low-stretch bandage system if needed, and a one-handed MEM home programme. At the first session, MEM was only performed to the trunk region and sometimes included pump points to the elbow region. Subsequent sessions involved MEM to the trunk and pump points distally to the wrist and MEM to the hand region depending on the patient&#8217;s clinical picture.Session took approximately 30 minutes. Patients were instructed to wear an isotoner open-finger compression glove except when receiving massage or undertaking personal hygiene. If the oedema became hard or brawny, the patient was instructed to use a multilayered low-stretch bandage and/or a chip bag together with the isotoner glove. At home, patients were instructed to perform a MEM exercise programme and a program for functional training. All treated by principal investigator</P>
<P>
<BR/>2. 'Traditional oedema treatment': elevation, compression, and functional training. Patient's digits and hand were wrapped in a compression bandage. Patients engaged in activity where arm was above shoulder height for at least 10 minutes; if possible, further treatment was performed above heart height. A Flowtron intermittent compression system with three chambers was used for 20 minutes to decrease hand/arm oedema. At home, patients were instructed to perform their home programme for oedema and mobility. During the night, all patients used an isotoner open-finger compression glove. All treated by the same experienced occupational therapist.</P>
<P>For both groups, oedema treatment was performed three times a week for four weeks and then twice a week for two weeks. After the initial 6 weeks, treatment was continued until function reached a level that reflected the patients&#8217; needs and the therapist&#8217;s assessment of functional requirements. All patients had ROM and strengthening therapy according "to need" at the hospital and as home exercises. All patients received identical instructions for home exercises to improve hand and wrist mobility, including one exercise for oedema.</P>

Three to five exercises were grouped in units requiring approximately 20 minutes. Instructions for 2 training units, to be performed once in the morning and once in the evening each day. Patients kept training dairy. Exercises were grouped by week: for first 2 weeks, priority was given to pain reduction and reduction of postoperative oedema; after the second week, passive stretching exercises were introduced, early active movements were added, without resistance, including stretching and spreading fingers, making a fist, forearm stretching, and bending and stretching the elbow, as well as abduction/adduction and external/internal rotation of the arm. Starting after the second week, exercises from the PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) technique were introduced. In the fifth week, dynamic muscle exercises against light resistance were increased. (Thus approximately 280 minutes exercise aimed for each week)</P>

Adoption of three paper-based exercise protocols (in cast, 6 weeks post-fracture and 9 weeks post-fracture). The orthopedic surgeon coached patients on each of the time-specific protocols at the appropriate time. Standard rehabilitation began with active ROM exercises for the neck, shoulder, elbow, fingers, and thumb while in the cast. After cast removal, exercises focussed on improving active and passive range of motion of the fractured wrist and hand (supination, pronation, flexion, extension). Stretching continued at 9 weeks post-fracture, and strengthening exercises were integrated into the exercise regimen. Strengthening exercises were prescribed once per day. Participants were instructed to complete the exercises 10 to 12 times per day. At 12 weeks postfracture, the patients were encouraged to continue with their exercises. All were unsupervised home exercises.

<P>This randomised trial, which started mid-1998, included 80 participants, aged 18 and above, with distal radial fractures referred for rehabilitation after plaster cast removal at Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, Derby, UK. It tested the order of provision of rehabilitation which comprised 4 sessions a week (2 physiotherapy and 2 occupational therapy): physiotherapy session before occupational therapy session versus occupational therapy session before physiotherapy session. The length of follow-up was six months and outcomes collected were: range of motion, grip strength, pinch strength, time to meet discharge criteria (attainment of 1/2 grip strength and 2/3 active ROM), Jebsen test (dexterity), DASH<BR/>

<P>Repeated contact was made with the lead investigator, Sarah Woodbridge, who confirmed that the trial had been completed. On last contact (9 November 2005), Sarah Woodbridge revealed that preparation of the written report had been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances.

<P>This involves the movement of a joint and can take two basic forms, which are not mutually exclusive:</P>

<BR/>Active: under the control of the patient&#8217;s own musculature<BR/>Passive: via an externally applied force, such as by a therapist</P>

</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Movement is part of keeping active and fit. Not moving results in loss of mobility (stiffness and joint contracture) and reduced muscle strength</P>
<P/>
<P>The range of movement under active control is usually less than that available passively; but a key advantage is that active movement emulates physiological function</P>
<P/>
<P>Passive mobilisation may be undertaken by the patient, but is more usually applied by a therapist</P>

</P>
<P>As well as the small sample size, there are potential problems with confounding in <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2001</LINK> due to differences in baseline characteristics and care programmes (there was no information on the numbers requiring longer plaster cast immobilisation). Thus, these promising results need confirmation in a larger sample size, with a longer duration of follow-up. Small sample size and incomplete assessment of outcome, for instance in the numbers referred for occupational therapy after plaster cast removal, in <LINK REF="STD-Gronlund-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gronlund 1990</LINK> mean that there was insufficient evidence to confirm either a lack of longer-term difference in outcome or a short-term advantage of early occupational therapy</P>

<P>The assessment at baseline and at 3 and 6 weeks follow-up by an independent physiotherapist, who noted complications, could be considered as part the care package provided to both groups and thus 'no intervention' is not as stark as it seems. Prior care before and during cast immobilisation may also have varied and impacted on the results. These are promising yet preliminary results given the small, short-term follow-up, and single centre setting<BR/>

<P/>
<P>Although four trials addressed essentially the same issue, namely routine or formal provision of therapy in addition to instructions for home exercises after plaster cast removal, the form of the therapy varied. In particular, the therapy tested by <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK> was specifically focussed on restoring optimal motor performance of activities that were limited in the individual participants. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>) focussed on older people and all four trials excluded those with serious complaints already manifest at cast removal, such as pain (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2001</LINK>) or CRPS-1 (<LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK>). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wakefield 2000</LINK> explicitly selected patients who were able to understand instructions</P>
<P/>
<P>Individually, none of these trials provide sufficiently robust evidence to confirm the finding of a lack of clinically important differences. All are prey to a type 2 error (false conclusion of no difference). Baseline differences hampered the analysis of the results of <LINK REF="STD-Bache-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2001</LINK>, but there was some evidence that the physiotherapy group tended to improve more from a less favourable starting position. The loss to follow up of eight (19.5%) of the 41 participants who started the trial interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Maciel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maciel 2005</LINK> could also have given rise to important bias. Ultimately, no pooling of data was possible and at best the general agreement in these four studies can only be viewed as weak evidence</P>

It is unclear but seems unlikely from the accounts of both trials that instructions and encouragement for home exercises were provided in the supervised therapy group. If so, this reduces the applicability given that instructions for home exercises are typically part of usual care. It should be noted that even if independent exercises using these rigorous schemes is enough for most patients after volar plate fixation, this low quality evidence does not rule out a role for supervised therapy.
