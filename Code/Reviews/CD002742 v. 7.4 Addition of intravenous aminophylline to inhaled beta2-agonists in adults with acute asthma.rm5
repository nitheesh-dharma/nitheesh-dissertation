I have corrected all the signs and graph labels for lung function (otherwise the copy editor will have to do this, which is not fair on them). I have also changed the results in the text. Please use compare versions to check you are happy that this is correct (second pair of eyes to look for errors is useful). Otherwise changes post peer review accepted and I think this can go for copy editing when you have had a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC following Peer review I have removed the Cates plot for admissions and changed the abstract, PLS, results and discussion to quantify only the statistically significant adverse events.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 29th June added Visual Rx plots for three dichotomous outcomes and linked these to the text. Abstract, PLS and Discussion revised to include absolute risks and benefits as shown in SoF table and the new figures. Ready for Peer review if the authors are happy with the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this update! General comment: I think we need to have a balance between being clear that it's an update and boring people to death with it!! Therefore I have merged some of the text together - I think this provides a better balance for the new reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i would suggest that you read trhough the tracked changes in the review and accept them before starting on your own changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I'm a bit confused - this review was split into two, but it seems that the head to head comparisons aminophylline verse beta2-agonists is also covered in Travers 2009 which has now been withdrawn and replaced.... I think we need to discuss this when you are back in the office Steve (i.e. not at 4 pm on a friday afternoon) and map out the reviews and their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The abstract has a little too much information around data collection and analysis and therefore I've revised the abstract to remove discussion of the results of the search. &lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order in the abstract should reflect the order in the review - hospital admissions should probably be more prominent as one of the key outcomes of ED treatment and a reduction in HA is highly cost efficient - can you re-jig it? &lt;b&gt;All ok&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting statement &amp;quot;These results could be added to consensus statements and guidelines&amp;quot; - have you checked that this paper is not referenced in the guidelines since the previous version? Bad PR if it has been! I think it has been referenced in the British Guideline on the Management of Asthma. BTS/SIGN Guideline No. 101. May 2008 Updated May 2011; and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA): Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [Updated 2010]!!! Double check for me please as it came from a spreadsheet used for our annual report. - &lt;b&gt;All ok now - it was referenced in Global strategy and so I have deleted the line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;treatment effects need to be correctly formatted and include the 95%CI - see insertions. They did not all appear to match what was in the text... so please check. &lt;b&gt;All ok now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what do you mean by overview? looks like a systematic review? &lt;b&gt;Yes its a term the Canadians seem to like (overview) but I have changed now to systematic review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there is some stuff that belongs int the results which I have copied and pasted accross for you &lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does this mean?? &amp;quot;Main outcome data was collected during the trial and blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) and in double-blind trials the blinding of study personnel responsible for outcome assessment indicates the risk of detection bias in the following studies would be low&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;Thanks - I have reworded it. Please see Blinding (performance bias and detection bias) section&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;incomplete outcome data - whey are they not all at low risk of bias if most people completed the trials? Was there lack of reporting of outcomes? &lt;b&gt;OK - its probably easier for us to discuss this in office as my first attempt to explain it here (in this note) looked like something out of Yes Prime Minister! Can we do this over a coffee?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the amount of data about Whig is disproportionate - which is further unjustifiable given that the majority of patients were presumably excluded, even if we cannot be 100% sure of that. &lt;b&gt;Thanks - do you think it looks better now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hospital admissions - stated there was significant heterogeneity. However, I2=6% when analysed using fixed or random effects, therefore I have to disagree with this statement - wsas this beciase of the exclusions &lt;b&gt;Yes I agree with you. Have sorted it out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I disagree that there was a trend in the number of people experiencing tremor - the results were conflicting and highly heterogeneous, if not significant &lt;b&gt;Yes I agree with you. Have sorted it out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the data for the subgroup/sensitivity analysis was not correctly formatted, so I started to format it using the format tool, and realised that none of it seems to match. I appreciate that you might not have entered the data, but we can't republish it if it's in the wrong place - please check each one and use the insert analysis result tool so the data is inserted in the correct format &lt;b&gt;Please see what I have done. Is it now OK?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what adjustment for baseline imbalances was performed? I could not repeat this if I wanted to and therefore it needs describing. After reading on a bit further: Ahh I see you have discussed this in the discussion - this should really be moved to the results section and mentioned in the discussion if necessary. &lt;b&gt;Please see my comment in final paragraph in Results. Is it now OK? Moved the para from Discussion so its now in Results in last para&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;as you could not meta-analyse data from all of the original trials, in my opinion it is meaningless to point out that you only added in the two new trials narratively - unless you want to be clear that no attempt was made in the prior version to add any studies narratively; in which case, you should say so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is this assertion correct? &amp;quot;These results suggest that the risk-benefit comparison very strongly favour the use of other bronchodilators for acute asthma than aminophylline. &amp;quot; you were not comparing them head-to head, so you need to limit the statement to the comparison which is the subject of the review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;where is the highlighted statement in the discussion supported? I can only see this in tremor (analysis 1.8) and Rodrigo also goes against the grain here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand what the following sentence about Wrenn either? surely many of the studies fall into this category and Wrenn was not statistically significant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the statement on Huang also appears incorrect - this study doesn't even contribute to the PEFR outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You start talking about studies that were excluded - were these the ones that are now in the other rveiew? therefore it might make more sense to delete that sentence? I think it would be clearer if you made a note in the 'results of the search' section so everyone is on the same page Emma. Please see the revised Discussion. Most of what you note above was in the previous published version of the review. I hope it now reads a lot better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary of findings table&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;suggest adding PEFR as it's your primary outcome Thanks I have done this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charateristics of included studies tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;there are quite a few questions marks that need to be checked and deleted I am discussing with Param as these pre-date my involvement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC checked. Great update Steve. Global accept changes will remove all your comments, but we could do this after Brian has had a chance to look through the revisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3/2/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC has checked RoB. Discuss with Steve for those we differ on. Is double blind enough for low risk of allocation concealment? I would classify as unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-11-12 12:00:54 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="AMIN-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.7" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.4">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-12 10:47:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation), which can cause breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Attacks can be severe or even fatal. The main drugs used to relieve a severe asthma attack are bronchodilators (reliever inhalers to open up the lungs and airways) for the spasms and corticosteroids (preventer medications to decrease the inflammation in the lungs and airways). The drug aminophylline has also been used intravenously (injected into the veins) for many years; however, this review of trials found that aminophylline is not significantly better than other bronchodilator drugs, and has more adverse effects. For every 100 people treated with aminophylline an additional 20 people had vomiting and 15 people arrhythmias or palpitations. This review was first published in 2000 and was updated in 2012 and the addition of two trials in 2012 did not alter the original conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-12 09:55:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is a chronic condition in which sufferers may have occasional or frequent exacerbations resulting in visits to the emergency department (ED). Aminophylline has been used extensively to treat exacerbations in acute asthma settings; however, it's role is unclear especially with respect to any additional benefit when added to inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-12 09:56:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the magnitude of effect of the addition of intravenous aminophylline to inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in adult patients with acute asthma treated in the ED setting.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-11-12 09:56:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group register (derived from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL standardised searches) and handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Two independent review authors screened and obtained potentially relevant articles and handsearched their bibliographic lists for additional articles. In the original version of this review published in 2000 we included searches of the database up to 1999. The 2012 review was updated with a revised search from inception to September 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-06-29 16:23:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous aminophylline versus placebo in adults with acute asthma and treated with inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. We included patients who were treated with or without corticosteroids or other bronchodilators provided this was not part of the randomised treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-12 09:56:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and one review author entered data into RevMan, which was checked by a second review author. Results are reported as mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidential intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 09:57:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifteen studies were included in the previous version of the review, and we included two new studies in this update, although we were unable to pool new data. Overall, the quality of the studies was moderate; concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only seven (45%) of the trials. There was significant clinical heterogeneity between studies as the doses of aminophylline and other medications and the severity of the acute asthma varied between studies.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant advantage when adding intravenous aminophylline with respect to hospital admissions (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.12; 6 studies; n = 315). In 2000 it was found that there was no statistically significant effect of aminophylline on airflow outcomes at any time period; the addition of two trials in 2012 has not challenged this conclusion. People treated with aminophylline and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists had similar peak expiratory flow (PEF) values compared to those treated with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists alone at 12 h (MD 8.30 L/min; 95% CI -20.69 to 37.29 L/min) or (MD -1.21% predicted; 95% CI -14.21% to 11.78% predicted) and 24 h (MD 22.20 L/min; 95% CI -56.65 to 101.05 L/min). Two subgroup analyses were performed by grouping studies according to mean baseline airflow limitation (11 studies) and the use of any corticosteroids (nine studies). There was no relationship between baseline airflow limitation or the use of corticosteroids on the effect of aminophylline. Aminophylline-treated patients reported more palpitations/arrhythmias (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.15 to 7.90; 6 studies; n = 249) and vomiting (OR 4.21; 95% CI 2.20 to 8.07; 7 studies; n = 321); however, no significant difference was found in tremor (OR 2.60; 95% CI 0.62 to 11.02; 5 studies; n = 249).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 09:58:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of intravenous aminophylline did not result in significant additional bronchodilation compared to standard care with inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation in the ED setting, or in a significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission. For every 100 people treated with aminophylline an additional 20 people had vomiting and 15 people arrhythmias or palpitations. No subgroups in which aminophylline might be more effective were identified. Our update in 2012 is consistent with the original conclusions that the risk-benefit balance of intravenous aminophylline is unfavourable.</P>

<P>Each year in the US over 10 million people experience an asthma exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 2006</LINK>) and in the UK there were 65,732 hospital admissions for asthma in the period 2005 to 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2011</LINK>).  In the US approximately 10% to 20% of patients with acute asthma are admitted to hospital, and 10% to 20% of patients discharged from the emergency department relapse within two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Camargo-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camargo 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camargo-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camargo 1998b</LINK>).

<P>In view of the fairly long history of randomised trial research in this area, going back to the 1970s, there is a large body of evidence on treating acute asthma in the emergency department (ED) setting. The main treatments include short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist agents and systemic corticosteroids. The focus of this review is on patients who present to EDs with worsening of their symptoms that usually require systemic corticosteroids. The review examines the effect of intravenous aminophylline in patients who felt ill enough to present to an EDor were admitted to hospitals and the entry criteria for most of the included trials defined asthma as physician-diagnosed.</P>

<P>Methylxanthines, such as theophylline (administered orally) and aminophylline (administered intravenously), have been used in the treatment of asthma since the 1960s and remain some of the most prescribed drugs for asthma worldwide. The mechanism of action of the methylxanthines is uncertain; the three main cellular effects are that of translocation of calcium, inhibition of the phosphodiesterase enzyme resulting in the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine receptor blockade.</P>

<P>Methylxanthines are weak bronchodilators, and they also interact with respiratory muscles to reduce respiratory muscle fatigue. Conventionally, the therapeutic benefit of xanthines has been ascribed to bronchodilation. With the development of safer and more potent bronchodilators, such as inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, there has been a decline in the use of methylxanthines. However, with the growing recognition that theophylline might modulate airway inflammation in asthma, there has been a resurgence in the interest in these agents.</P>

<P>The use of xanthines varies in different parts of the world. Most international guidelines recommend the use of theophylline only as an additional bronchodilator in chronic asthma that remains difficult to control despite moderate- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Its use in acute severe asthma has declined in the past decade due to the systematic review evidence accumulated in the past (<LINK REF="REF-Littenberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littenberg 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nair-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2000</LINK>). There have been a number of studies comparing intravenous aminophylline with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and the combination of the two with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists alone; however, prior to systematic reviews the results have been conflicting. It was widely believed that intravenous aminophylline was effective in relieving bronchoconstriction in acute asthma as an initial treatment drug. There have been several systematic reviews published dealing with the use of methylxanthines in acute asthma. The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2000</LINK>) concluded "in acute asthma, the use of intravenous aminophylline did not result in any additional bronchodilation compared to standard care with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. The frequency of adverse effects was higher with aminophylline. No subgroups in which aminophylline might be more effective could be identified. These results should be added to consensus statements and guidelines". The current version of this review aimed to examine this conclusion in relation to any relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that may have been completed since 1999.</P>
<P>Separate reviews are available in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> for: intravenous aminophylline for acute severe asthma in children over two years of age receiving inhaled bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-Mitra-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitra 2009</LINK>) and Intravenous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for acute asthma in the emergency department (<LINK REF="REF-Travers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travers 2009</LINK>).

<P>In 2000, a total of 210 abstracts were identified using the CAGR. Two independent review authors identified a total of 27 potentially eligible studies for further review.

<P>Populations: studies were mainly conducted in adults (older than 18 years) but two studies included subjects older than 15 years (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coleridge-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coleridge 1993</LINK>), two older than 16 years (<LINK REF="STD-Josephson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Josephson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) and one did not report the age range (<LINK REF="STD-Appel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Appel 1981</LINK>).

The upper limit of age among included trials was from 25 to 60 years. The populations were defined as people attending emergency departments with "acute asthma" or "acute exacerbation of asthma" and who were previously diagnosed with asthma. However, a detailed definition of "acute" was described in only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Appel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Appel 1981</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1985</LINK>). Three studies included subjects with a chief complaint of asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Josephson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Josephson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossing-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rossing 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanta-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Fanta 1982</LINK>). Asthma criteria were generally established according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several of the studies were small, so matching of severity at baseline was not always achieved. This led to difficulties where results were presented as measurements at a time point rather than as changes from baseline. Baseline differences in severity may thus bias results between groups. To adjust for this, baseline differences were calculated and added to the disadvantaged group. The analysis was then repeated, using the original standard deviation (SD).</P>
<P>Severity of exacerbation: severity of the exacerbation was generally based on symptoms and the degree of airflow limitation of participants; however, this was not always specified in the manuscript. The airflow limitation was classified as "severe" in 11 trials as defined by PEF (&lt; 40 % predicted or 150 L/min) or FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (&lt; 40% predicted or 1 L).</P>
<P>Interventions: the doses of aminophylline and other medications varied among studies. Trials specified different beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (five used epinephrine, five salbutamol, three meta-isoproterenol, two isoproterenol and two albuterol). Similarly, co-intervention with corticosteroids was clearly documented and varied among trials; five trials used hydrocortisone, four methylprednisolone and the remaining nine trials did not use systemic corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Outcomes: a variety of outcomes were reported. Whenever feasible, the most commonly reported outcomes are reported and include: pulmonary functions (e.g. PEF, % PEF, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and % FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), admissions and adverse effects.</P>

<P>There were no statistically significant differences in PEF or FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between aminophylline and placebo observed at any time period studied apart from in the one study <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1994</LINK> contributing FEV<SUB>1</SUB> data at 30 min (MD -0.26 L; 95% CI -0.49 to -0.03 L; 1 study; n = 94; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); however, there was also a difference between groups at baseline in this study.

One hour after starting aminophylline, the treated group had similar values to the control group for both PEF (MD 6.24 L/min; 95% CI -21.09 to 33.57 L/min; 6 studies; n = 302; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; MD -2.28% predicted; 95% CI -4.84 to 0.27% predicted; 6 studies; n = 285; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (MD 0.05 L; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.23 L; 8 studies; n = 419; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; MD -2.99% predicted; 95% CI -13.05 to 7.07% predicted; 3 studies; n = 176; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).

The same results were demonstrated at 24 h for PEF (MD 22.20 L/min; 95% CI -56.65 to 101.05 L/min; 2 studies; n = 40; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There were no data available at this time point relating to PEF % predicted). At 24 h FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>was not significantly different (MD 0.42; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.97; 1 study; n = 21; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; MD 4.35% predicted; 95% CI -16.68 to 25.39% predicted; 2 studies; n = 39; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). These differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically important.</P>
<P>Given that very few studies provided data at 12 or 24 h, the studies were re-analysed by pooling all studies that provided a measurement at either time point using an SMD. If one study had results expressed in both % predicted and absolute values, the latter were used. The results remained unchanged; there was no significant effect of aminophylline.</P>
<P>Two trials were identified in the 2012 update of this review that could not be statistically included in the meta-analysis: <LINK REF="STD-Pavalakou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pavalakou 2006</LINK> stated that the addition of intravenous aminophylline did not contribute benefit to patients experiencing an acute asthma attack. We were not able to obtain data from the adult subset of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Whig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whig 2001</LINK> although across all the children and adults (aged two to 25 years) there was no significant difference between the two groups on this outcome on any of the five time points monitored.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that PEF and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> are not directly comparable but both are included here as they are commonly used outcome measures in emergency departments to decide on discharge from the emergency departments and to assess response to treatment. PEF, being a simpler measurement, is used more widely but it is less reproducible than FEV<SUB>1</SUB>.</P>

<P>Similarly, seven trials (321 participants) reported vomiting and there were more events in participants randomised to receive aminophylline (OR 4.21; 95% CI 2.20 to 8.07; 7 studies; n = 321; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK> shows that nine control group participants out of 100 had vomiting compared to 29 out of 100 (95% CI 18/100 to 44/100) participants receiving intravenous aminophylline.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses were performed by grouping studies according to mean baseline airflow limitation for our primary outcome, pulmonary function, only. Using our PEF criteria for severity, two studies included subjects classified as mild-moderate asthma and seven as severe asthma. In the studies involving participants with mild-moderate acute asthma there was no difference between treatment groups at baseline (SMD -0.23; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.83; 2 studies; n = 124; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). This did not change at one hour (SMD 0.26; 95% CI -0.21 to 0.73; 2 studies; n = 124; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). There was insufficient reporting at 12 or 24 h to conduct further subgroup analyses. The studies that included patients with severe acute asthma indicated a higher PEF level at baseline in the control group (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.09; 7 studies; n = 285; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). There was no difference at one hour (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.17; 7 studies; n = 285; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) or at 24 h (MD 22.20; 95% CI -56.65 to 101.05; 2 studies; n = 40; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). Using our FEV<SUB>1</SUB> criteria for baseline asthma severity, four studies were included in the severe group and five in the moderately severe group. Generally very similar (non-significant) results were obtained with the exception of the difference observed at 30 min, with data contributed by only one study, where a higher FEV<SUB>1</SUB> level was observed in the control group (SMD -0.45; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.04; 1 study; n = 94; <LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>When studies were grouped according to the use of corticosteroids, the bronchodilator effect of the aminophylline treatment was similar in the corticosteroid-treated group and the non-corticosteroid-treated group. Six studies used corticosteroids and three did not. At baseline, in the patients given corticosteroids, there was no difference in PEF between treatment groups (SMD 0.20; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.03; 6 studies; n = 293; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>); the same was found at one hour (SMD -0.04; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.23; 6 studies; n = 293; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), at 12 h (SMD -0.02; 95% CI -0.38 to 0.35; 4 studies; n = 115; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) and at 24 h (SMD 0.17; 95% CI -0.46 to 0.79; 2 studies; n = 40; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). In the studies in which patients did not receive corticosteroids, there was no difference at baseline (SMD -0.10; 95% CI -0.82 to 0.62; 3 studies; n = 116; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) and at one hour (SMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.78; 3 studies; n = 116; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). There was insufficient reporting at 12 or 24 h to conduct further subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>The pooled treatment group had lower values for PEF and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> than the pooled control group at baseline. Owing to the limitations of the software in 2000, which was unable to deal with repeated measures and to adjust by baseline values, we dealt with this problem by recalculating our results after adding the baseline differences to the disadvantaged group at 30 min and thereafter. Then, we repeated the analysis using these "new adjusted data". Sensitivity analyses were performed adjusting for baseline differences, using methodological criteria and fixed-effect modelling. Given the baseline differences between treated and control groups, adjustment of the aminophylline-treated group pulmonary function measures was performed. One hour after starting aminophylline, there was no difference in PEF (MD 8.9 L/min; 95% CI -10 to 27 L/min; MD -0.8% predicted; 95% CI -3 to 1% predicted) or FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (MD 0.1 L; 95% CI -0.0 to 0.2 L; MD -4.7% predicted; 95% CI -15 to 6% predicted). Similarly, 12 and 24 h after aminophylline infusion, there were neither statistically nor clinically important differences between treatments.</P>

<P>This systematic review examined the use of aminophylline in the early management of acute asthma in the ED. The meta-analysis is based on 15 studies that included 739 patients (353 aminophylline versus 386 standard treatment) after a comprehensive search for high-quality evidence on the topic, and in the 2012 update a further two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Whig-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whig 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavalakou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pavalakou 2006</LINK>) were narratively included to provide additional context from a further 78 participants. The pooled results demonstrated no clear benefit of aminophylline therapy in improving pulmonary function or preventing hospital admission. Overall, this review identified no additional bronchodilator effect of intravenous aminophylline when added to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in acute asthma. The side effects associated with aminophylline treatment were more common than in the groups treated with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists alone. For every 100 people treated with intravenous aminophylline, 20 more people had vomiting and 15 more had arrhythmias or palpitations.</P>

<P>Despite subgroup analyses based on corticosteroid use and asthma severity, no groups in which aminophylline would be of benefit were identified. The lack of heterogeneity in the overall pooled results suggests these findings are consistent over a number of trials. However, subgroup comparisons should be interpreted with caution in this meta-analysis, as all comparisons were made among studies rather than within studies, and the differences in effect sizes were small (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the 17 identified RCTs concluded that the addition of intravenous aminophylline contributed little to the treatment of acute asthma in the ED setting and there is a clear indication that the addition of aminophylline leads to a higher incidence of vomiting (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) and arrhythmia/palpitations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is a possibility of publication bias in this meta-analysis, in that by missing unpublished negative trials, the (albeit non-significant) effect of aminophylline therapy may be overestimated and missing unpublished positive trials may underestimate the therapeutic benefit. However, we feel we have identified the majority of the research available dealing with this clinical question by employing a comprehensive systematic search and our attempts to find unpublished trials, including extensive correspondence with the authors of six of the included studies as well as other experts in the field, searching of abstracts from conferences and contact with pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>There were several methodological limitations to this review. There was the problem associated with the variety of pulmonary function outcomes and assessments. For example, airflow limitation was expressed as PEF as well as FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and each one could be reported as absolute or relative values. We combined absolute and relative scores using SMDs in our subgroup analyses. Although it has some recognised limitations, by broadening the analysis at the cost of losing specific focus, we attempted to address this problem by providing absolute and % predicted (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or PEF) values using the SMD for the outcome reported. This approach confirmed the results from the analyses that used absolute measurements or % predicted results aggregated using an MD. In addition, most trials reported data until the first hour preventing us from commenting with confidence on the one- to 12-h period; however, the lack of change at 12 h is reassuring.</P>
<P>There was also a possibility of study selection bias; however, we employed two independent review authors, and feel confident that the studies excluded were evaluated on consistent and appropriate criteria.</P>
<P>It would be worthwhile to produce a systematic review of the anti-inflammatory effects of aminophylline either on its own or additive to those of inhaled corticosteroids, when used in low or high dose.</P>

<P>This is not the first meta-analysis to evaluate the benefits of the addition of aminophylline to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Littenberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littenberg 1988</LINK> published a meta-analysis that yielded similar conclusions. However, many debates arose from this review owing to concerns regarding methodology. We believe our review dealt with these problems by following the Cochrane methodology and excluding non-randomised clinical trials. The conclusions in this update accord with the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2000</LINK>).</P>

<OL>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of aminophylline in the management of acute asthma when adequate inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment is provided.</LI>
<LI>The development of side effects is significantly higher with aminophylline treatment than inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist therapy alone.</LI>
<LI>Treatments with efficacious agents (e.g., beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and anticholinergic agents, systemic and inhaled corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, etc) should be encouraged before consideration is given to intravenous aminophylline therapy.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>Most of the studies in this review did not provide data beyond the first hour of follow-up and there were only small differences demonstrated at 12 and 24 h. It is possible that aminophylline provides some additional late bronchodilator effects or benefits aside from airway relaxation. However, the magnitude of this effect would be clinically irrelevant in the emergency department and such small potential benefit in bronchodilation would not justify a new emergency department study.</LI>
<LI>Owing to the small samples in certain subgroups, the conclusions from these analyses require further evaluation. For example, the most severe subgroup data may be the only area in which aminophylline treatment would justify additional trials. One subgroup in particular that may benefit from further empirical consideration through randomised trials is those who experience no relief from nebulised beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists.</LI>
<LI>It is possible that aminophylline may provide benefits in asthma beyond bronchodilation, particularly by exerting an anti-inflammatory effect by increasing intracellular cyclic AMP. This can be evaluated only by studying markers of inflammation in airway lumen or in biopsy samples.</LI>
