<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of medical interventions for treating people with traumatic hyphema.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the space between the cornea (clear outer layer of the eye) and iris (colored disc behind the cornea) following a blow to the eye. Along with the appearance of blood, there may be one or more major injuries to the eye from the trauma, which could result in loss of vision. In most cases, the blood is absorbed, but in some cases, there is a secondary hemorrhage (the appearance of fresh blood in the eye after the initial trauma). Complications resulting from secondary hemorrhage include glaucoma, corneal bloodstaining, or damage to the optic nerve (the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain). These complications also can result in permanent loss of vision.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases up to August 2013 and found 20 randomized controlled trials and seven quasi-randomized trials (trials where people were not allocated randomly but another method of grouping was used, e.g. date of birth, person's medical record number) relevant to this review. The 27 trials included 2643 total participants. Most trials included participants from all age groups and had more men than women. Outcomes mostly were examined at one week post-treatment (ranging up to three years afterwards).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Antifibrinolytic drugs are often used to treat traumatic hyphema and are thought to be effective, because they delay absorption of blood clots until complete healing of the damaged blood vessels takes place. This review found that antifibrinolytics did not affect final vision, but did appear to reduce the risk of secondary bleeding. However, patients taking one of the antifibrinolytics, aminocaproic acid, appeared to have more nausea and vomiting compared with control patients. Two other antifibrinolytics, tranexamic acid and aminomethylbenzoic acid, also reduced the risk of secondary hemorrhage, but there was limited information about side effects. It was unclear whether these medications reduced complications of secondary hemorrhage, because these events did not occur often in the studies.</P>
<P>Other medications evaluated in trials included corticosteroids, either taken internally or applied as eyedrops; estrogens; and other kinds of eyedrops. Nondrug interventions included wearing a patch on one or both eyes, moderate activity versus bed rest, and elevation of the head versus laying flat. Because the number of participants and events were small, the evidence for a beneficial effect of any of these interventions is inconclusive.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-04 09:25:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and iris) subsequent to a blow or a projectile striking the eye. Hyphema uncommonly causes permanent loss of vision. Associated trauma (e.g. corneal staining, traumatic cataract, angle recession glaucoma, optic atrophy, etc.) may seriously affect vision. Such complications may lead to permanent impairment of vision. Patients with sickle cell trait/disease may be particularly susceptible to increases of elevated intraocular pressure. If rebleeding occurs, the rates and severity of complications increase.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-05 22:29:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included 20 randomized and seven quasi-randomized studies with 2643 participants in this review. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents (oral and systemic aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), corticosteroids (systemic and topical), cycloplegics, miotics, aspirin, conjugated estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, monocular versus bilateral patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. No intervention had a significant effect on visual acuity whether measured at two weeks or less after the trauma or at longer time periods. The number of days for the primary hyphema to resolve appeared to be longer with the use of aminocaproic acid compared with no use, but was not altered by any other intervention.</P>
<P>Systemic aminocaproic acid reduced the rate of recurrent hemorrhage (odds ratio (OR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.57), but a sensitivity analysis omitting studies not using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis reduced the strength of the evidence (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.09). We obtained similar results for topical aminocaproic acid (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10). We found tranexamic acid had a significant effect in reducing the rate of secondary hemorrhage (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49), as did aminomethylbenzoic acid as reported in one study (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.32). The evidence to support an associated reduction in the risk of complications from secondary hemorrhage (i.e. corneal bloodstaining, peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, and development of optic atrophy) by antifibrinolytics was limited by the small number of these events. Use of aminocaproic acid was associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and other adverse events compared with placebo. We found no difference in the number of adverse events with the use of systemic versus topical aminocaproic acid or with standard versus lower drug dose. </P>
<P>The available evidence on usage of corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or aspirin in traumatic hyphema was limited due to the small numbers of participants and events in the trials.</P>
<P>We found no difference in effect between a single versus binocular patch or ambulation versus complete bed rest on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-05 22:56:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Traumatic hyphema in the absence of other intraocular injuries uncommonly leads to permanent loss of vision. Complications resulting from secondary hemorrhage could lead to permanent impairment of vision, especially in patients with sickle cell trait/disease. We found no evidence to show an effect on visual acuity by any of the interventions evaluated in this review. Although evidence was limited, it appears that patients with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhaging. However, hyphema in patients treated with aminocaproic acid take longer to clear.</P>
<P>Other than the possible benefits of antifibrinolytic usage to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage, the decision to use corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or nondrug interventions (such as binocular patching, bed rest, or head elevation) should remain individualized because no solid scientific evidence supports a benefit. As these multiple interventions are rarely used in isolation, further research to assess the additive effect of these interventions might be of value.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and iris) subsequent to a blow or a projectile striking the eye. Apart from the direct consequences of the initial trauma, traumatic hyphema is usually a self limiting condition that rarely causes permanent loss of vision in the absence of associated damage to the cornea, lens, or optic nerve. Traumatic hyphema is an important clinical entity because of the risks associated with significant initial reduction in vision and because of associated injuries to the tissues of the eye. In young children, it can lead to the development of irreversible amblyopia. Complications resulting from secondary hemorrhage, such as glaucoma, corneal bloodstaining, or optic atrophy, can lead to permanent impairment of vision, especially if the hyphema is prolonged in association with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Traumatic hyphema usually is seen in children or young adults with an incidence of approximately two per 10,000 children per year (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2003</LINK>). Males predominate with a male to female ratio of 3:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Crouch-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 1993</LINK>). Sports injuries account for 60% of traumatic hyphemas (<LINK REF="REF-Crouch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Patients usually present with a sudden decrease or loss of vision following an injury to the eye. The loss of vision depends on the level of hyphema; a patient with a microhyphema occasionally may present with normal vision or with somewhat blurred vision, whereas a patient with a full hyphema may present with almost complete loss of vision. With time, blood in the anterior chamber is forced by gravity to the bottom of the anterior chamber. Subsequently, vision clears gradually unless associated injuries, traumatic uveitis, glaucoma, optic atrophy, or corneal bloodstaining contributes to further losses of vision.</P>
<P>The severity of traumatic hyphema varies from microhyphema, where red blood cells are suspended in the anterior chamber, to a layered hyphema where fresh or clotted blood may be observed grossly in the lower anterior chamber. In a full or total hyphema, the entire anterior chamber is filled with blood.</P>
<P>Recurrent hemorrhage, occurring at a rate of 2% to 38% (<LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK>), increases the time to visual recovery and has been associated with poorer visual outcomes. Secondary hemorrhage typically occurs three to five days after the incident hyphema and may occur due to clot lysis and retraction within the traumatized vessels.</P>
<P>Hyphema in the setting of sickle cell trait/disease appears to be particularly dangerous because the naturally hypoxic and relatively acidotic anterior chamber induces sickling of red blood cells. Sickling in turn prevents normal egress of those blood cells through the trabecular meshwork. Hyphema patients with sickle cell trait/disease may be at a higher risk for elevated IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most important sign for diagnosing hyphema is the presence of blood in the anterior chamber assessed by a slit lamp exam. Various grading schemes for hyphema have been proposed. Objective quantification of the level of hyphema is critical, because a sudden increase in the height of a layered hyphema is indicative of 'rebleed'. Immediate measurement of IOP and a dilated ophthalmoscopic exam (to rule out traumatic retinal tears, dialyses, and detachment) are also indicated at a relatively early time after clearance of hyphema.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-04 15:11:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Management of traumatic hyphema focuses on preventing repeated eye trauma and rebleed, promoting the settling of blood away from the visual axis, controlling traumatic anterior uveitis, and monitoring in order to initiate early prophylaxis or treatment for both secondary glaucoma and corneal bloodstaining. The methods that have been employed to prevent recurrent or iatrogenic trauma include shielding the eye, bed rest, and avoidance of diagnostic interventions such as scleral depression or gonioscopy that could deform the globe. Elevation of the head while sleeping, topical corticosteroids, and cycloplegic medications are mainstays in the management of traumatic hyphema. Hospitalization, once considered essential in order to enforce bed rest, has been questioned and currently is advocated only for patients perceived to be at high risk of rebleed, at risk of noncompliance with bed rest at home, or possibly, with sickle cell trait/disease.</P>
<P>The use of antifibrinolytic agents such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid in traumatic hyphema is controversial. They are reported to have potential for reducing the rate of recurrent hemorrhage, but are known to have several possible side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, conjunctival suffusion, headache, rash, pruritis, dyspnea, toxic confusional states, arrhythmias, and systemic hypotension. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant and in patients with coagulopathies or renal diseases; it should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular diseases. A topical gel form of epsilon-aminocaproic acid has not yet received US Food and Drug Association (FDA) approval. It appears to have comparable effectiveness, with fewer side effects, as compared with the oral form, and thus might be used on an outpatient basis. Tranexamic acid (Cyclokapron) is reported to be more potent than epsilon-aminocaproic acid and has similar side effects, but with fewer gastric side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Rahmani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmani 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids also have been used to treat hyphema and have been reported to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK>). Investigators have studied both topical and systemic corticosteroids, applying these agents for varying lengths of time with or without other interventions, such as bed rest or cycloplegics. Topical administration of corticosteroids avoids the side effects of systemic corticosteroid use, but it is not known whether topically applied corticosteroids are as effective as systemic corticosteroids in reducing the rate of rebleed. The mechanism of action of corticosteroids is thought to be due to stabilization of the blood-ocular barrier, direct inhibition of fibrinolysis, or reduced inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical evacuation of hyphema generally is not needed. In the past, surgical evacuation was often contraindicated due to the possibility of sudden decreases in IOP and increased risk of recurrent hemorrhage (due to decompression of the damaged iris and ciliary body). However, surgical 'washout' is advocated in patients with nonclearing hyphema, in whom secondary glaucoma threatens to cause permanent visual loss due to glaucomatous optic neuropathy or to corneal bloodstaining. Surgical washout often is performed (via simple paracentesis) in patients with sickle cell trait because of the increased risk of elevated IOP.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-04 15:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The mode of action of medications used to treat traumatic hyphema, especially the antifibrinolytics, is through slowing or inhibiting the resorption of the blood clot within traumatized blood vessels. Aminocaproic acid slows the dissolution of the fibrin blood clot by competing at sites that bind lysine, including lysine sites on tissue plasminogen activator, inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the enzyme involved in the breakdown of the fibrin clot (<LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK>). Aminocaproic acid also competitively inhibits the binding of plasmin to the fibrin clot itself. Both of these mechanisms result in slowing the breakdown of the fibrin clot, thus stabilizing it and reducing the risk of secondary hemorrhage. Tranexamic acid also binds to fibrin and is believed to act through a similar mechanism. The action of aminobenzoic acid involves inhibition of fibrinolysis, and estrogens decrease antithrombin activity, both of which result in delays of clot resorption (<LINK REF="REF-Westlund-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westlund 1982</LINK>). In addition to inhibition of fibrinolysis, corticosteroids are also believed to stabilize the blood-ocular barrier and reduce inflammation.  </P>
<P>The goal of most of the other interventions used in the management of traumatic hyphema is to prevent complications from the trauma or from a rebleed, including further trauma, anterior uveitis, secondary glaucoma, optic atrophy, or corneal bloodstaining. These interventions include bed rest and eye patching to prevent further trauma; use of mydriatic or miotic agents to prevent motion of the iris, increased IOP, or uveitis; corticosteroids to prevent inflammation; and elevation of the head to facilitate settling of the blood in the anterior chamber. Hospitalization facilitates close monitoring of the more severe cases of trauma or rebleeding (or both), allowing more timely medical or surgical intervention, if warranted.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-04 15:24:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the existence of guidelines for the management of traumatic hyphema (<LINK REF="REF-Crouch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crouch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rhee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK>), the safety and effectiveness of various therapeutic modalities such as use of antifibrinolytic agents, their routes of administration, use of corticosteroids, and hospitalization are controversial. The evidence for the impact of rebleed on visual outcomes, glaucoma, optic atrophy, and bloodstaining is limited. Furthermore, rebleed, which is a surrogate outcome (rather than visual outcome) dominates the published literature on management of traumatic hyphema. It is important to examine the impact of the various antifibrinolytic medications, routes of administration, and dosages used across various populations.</P>

The following parameters were considered: adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), masking of participants and researchers (performance bias), masking of outcome assessors (detection bias), adequate handling of incomplete data by reporting rates of follow-up and using ITT analysis (attrition bias), and complete reporting of outcomes (reporting bias). Each of the parameters was graded as having low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias, or high risk of bias. We documented agreement between authors. We resolved disagreements by consensus, or by a third author. We used masking of participants and care providers as a quality criterion only in interventions where masking was feasible.

Of studies reporting demographic data, the mean age of participants ranged from 10 to 32 years, and the proportion of male participants ranged from 67% to 100%. Studies took place in a number of different countries: three in China; two each in Iran, Sweden, and South Africa; one each in Denmark, Israel, and Malaysia; and the remainder in Canada and the US. The race of participants varied by country, and nine studies reported 50% or more black participants.</P>
<P>Three types of antifibrinolytic agents (epsilon-aminocaproic acid (aminocaproic acid), tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid) were investigated in the included studies. Other types of pharmaceuticals investigated by the studies included in this review were corticosteroids; including prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, and cortisone; conjugated estrogen; aspirin; and topical mydriatics and miotics. One study compared traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (Yunnan Baiyao) versus antihemorrhagic agents. Nonpharmaceutical interventions included the use of monocular or binocular patching, eye shields, bed rest, and elevation of the head. The primary outcome for all but three studies was the risk of a secondary hemorrhage.</P>

In total, the six studies included 331 participants (34 to 94 participants per study); 175 participants were randomized to receive oral aminocaproic acid, and 156 participants were randomized to receive placebo pills. The follow-up periods ranged from the length of hospitalization (typically about one to two weeks) to 3.4 years after discharge.</P>
<P>Two studies evaluated topical aminocaproic acid and included 206 participants. <LINK REF="STD-Karkhaneh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karkhaneh 2003</LINK> had three treatment groups: 45 participants were randomized to receive aminocaproic acid (two drops of 25% aminocaproic acid in 2% carboxymethylene gel applied to the inferior fornix of the affected eye every six hours for five days) plus homatropine eyedrops three times per day; 44 participants were randomized to receive placebo gel plus homatropine eyedrops; and 66 participants were randomized to receive homatropine eyedrops only. Homatropine is a cycloplegic agent used to prevent eye muscles from moving temporarily and to enlarge the pupil. The follow-up period for this study was 14 days. In <LINK REF="STD-Pieramici-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pieramici 2003</LINK>, 24 participants were randomized to receive aminocaproic acid (30% aminocaproic acid in 2% gel instilled in the inferior fornix following one drop of 0.05% proparacaine hydrochloride every six hours for five days), and 27 participants were randomized to receive placebo gel applied in the same manner as the intervention group. Participants in this study were managed on an outpatient or inpatient basis and followed for seven days.</P>
<P>One included study compared oral aminocaproic acid versus topical aminocaproic acid for the treatment of traumatic hyphema (<LINK REF="STD-Crouch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crouch 1997</LINK>). Of 118 participants eligible for inclusion in the study, 64 participants agreed to be randomized to receive either topical aminocaproic acid (0.2 mL of 30% aminocaproic acid in 2% carboxymethylene gel applied to the inferior fornix every six hours plus oral placebo solution every four hours for five days) or oral aminocaproic acid (50 mg/kg of body weight of oral aminocaproic acid, up to 30 g per day, plus placebo gel every four hours for five days). The 54 participants who declined study entry were followed as an untreated control group. The participants in this study were hospitalized and followed for five days.</P>
<P>The last study investigating the use of aminocaproic acid compared low-dose oral aminocaproic acid (50 mg/kg, up to 5 g per dose or 30 g per day every four hours for five days) versus the standard-dose oral aminocaproic acid (100 mg/kg, up to 5 g per dose or 30 g per day every four hours for five days) for the treatment of traumatic hyphema (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1986</LINK>).

There were 581 participants included in the studies; 279 were assigned to tranexamic acid and 302 to a control intervention. The doses of tranexamic acid administered in these studies varied from 1.75 mg/kg per day for five days to 1.5 g per day for seven days. Participants were followed for five to 12 days. The study using the lowest dose of tranexamic acid assigned 82 participants to oral tranexamic acid 1.75 mg/kg daily for five days, 81 to prednisone 0.75 mg/kg daily for five days, and 81 to daily placebo for five days. All participants were followed for five days (<LINK REF="STD-Rahmani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmani 1999</LINK>).

Both groups were followed for one week. In <LINK REF="STD-Vangsted-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Vangsted 1983</LINK>, 59 participants were randomized to receive tranexamic acid and 53 participants were randomized to receive complete bed rest for six days; follow-up was seven days. <LINK REF="STD-Varnek-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Varnek 1980</LINK> compared the same dose of tranexamic acid, 25 mg/kg daily for seven days along with hospitalization and bed rest (n = 102), versus hospitalization and bed rest alone in the control group (n = 130). Participants were followed for 12 days. In <LINK REF="STD-Welsh-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Welsh 1983</LINK>, 19 participants were randomized to receive the largest dose of tranexamic acid, three 500 mg tablets of oral tranexamic acid three times a day for seven days (for an overall total dose of 31.5 g tranexamic acid), and 20 participants were randomized to receive three tablets of placebo three times a day for seven days.</P>

<P>One included study compared oral aminomethylbenzoic acid versus placebo for the treatment of traumatic hyphema (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2002</LINK>). The study, published in Chinese, randomized 60 participants to the intervention group and 32 participants to the placebo group. Participants in the intervention group received oral aminomethylbenzoic acid 0.5 g plus oral vitamin B1 20 mg three times a day for six days. For children, the dosage of aminomethylbenzoic acid was modified to "follow age-recommended dose"; the vitamin B1 dosage remained the same. Participants in the control group received oral vitamin B1 (20 mg) three times a day for six days. The follow-up period for the study was one week post blood resolution.</P>

All participants were followed for seven days and some for up to six months. The second study consisted of three intervention arms with 244 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Rahmani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmani 1999</LINK>). One arm of the study included 82 participants who received oral tranexamic acid 75 mg/kg per day, divided into three doses per day, for five days. The second arm included 81 participants who received oral prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg per day, divided into two doses per day, for five days.

All were followed through the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Farber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Farber 1991</LINK>). Those in the aminocaproic acid group received 50 mg/kg oral aminocaproic acid (up to 30 g per day) every four hours plus two doses of placebo for five days. Those in the prednisone group received 40 mg/day of oral prednisone in two doses plus six doses of placebo; children and adults weighing less than 60 kg were given 0.6 mg/kg/day of prednisone for five days.

<P>Twenty of the 27 studies included in the review were RCTs. Seven studies specified using computerized randomization to generate the allocation sequence and one study used a randomization list; we judged these eight studies as having a low risk of sequence generation bias (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Twelve of the 20 RCTs did not report methods of allocation; therefore, we assessed these studies as having an unclear risk of sequence generation bias. Of the 20 included randomized trials, eight reported that allocation concealment was implemented: one study used sealed numbered envelopes, two studies used coded bottles, and five studies maintained the randomization code at a pharmacy or other central study center; and 12 studies did not report methods of allocation concealment. The remaining seven studies were controlled clinical trials but did not use randomization to assign participants to treatment. Participants were allocated by alternation for four studies, and by date of admission in one study. The method of allocation was not reported in the remaining two controlled clinical trials.</P>

<P>Twelve of the 20 included RCTs were double-masked (participants and investigators), placebo-controlled trials. One study investigating two doses of oral aminocaproic acid was also double-masked (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1986</LINK>).

In both of these studies, it was noted that the ophthalmologists and outcome assessors were not involved in participant treatment and were masked to the treatment groups. The interventions of interest in two studies precluded masking; the first study compared aspirin three times daily versus observation only (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1988</LINK>), and the second study compared bed confinement versus walking and oral tranexamic acid three times daily (<LINK REF="STD-Vangsted-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Vangsted 1983</LINK>). Two studies did not mention whether or not masking occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>), and authors of one study reported that no masking was done (<LINK REF="STD-Zi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zi 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Attrition rates for included studies were minimal due to the nature of the condition and treatment regimens. Typically, treatment duration for traumatic hyphema at the time the studies were completed comprised one week or less, and hospitalization was frequently implemented. Eighteen of the 27 included studies reported no exclusions or losses to follow-up, and thus used ITT analyses. Of the nine studies that excluded participants from the analysis, four studies excluded only one or two participants due to an adverse effect of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Crouch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crouch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kutner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1986</LINK>), treatment failure (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1986</LINK>), or loss of a patient's medical record (<LINK REF="STD-McGetrick-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McGetrick 1983</LINK>).

<P>In general, the hyphemas in participants assigned to aminocaproic acid took longer to clear than those in participants assigned to placebo or control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Christianson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christianson 1979</LINK> noted that drug-treated hyphemas tended to take longer to clear compared with controls but reported that it was significant only among hyphemas filling more than half of the anterior chamber. Of the five remaining studies using oral aminocaproic acid, the mean time to resolution of the primary hemorrhage ranged from 4.1 to 6.7 days in the aminocaproic acid group and 2.4 to 6.3 days in the placebo group among all participants.

In <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 1987</LINK>, the time to resolution appeared to be associated with initial hyphema severity, with larger initial hyphemas taking longer to resolve.

Participants who were assigned to receive aminocaproic acid, either orally or topically, experienced a secondary hemorrhage less often compared with participants receiving placebo. This association was stronger when oral aminocaproic acid was used (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) than when topical aminocaproic acid was used (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Because an ITT analysis was not performed in two studies of oral aminocaproic acid, each of which excluded one participant from analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kutner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kutner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGetrick-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McGetrick 1983</LINK>), we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of excluding these studies.

<P>Of the six studies comparing oral aminocaproic acid versus placebo, four excluded participants with sickle cell trait (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kutner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGetrick-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McGetrick 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teboul-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teboul 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Crouch-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Crouch 1976</LINK> reported that eight participants had sickle cell trait, although the trial investigators do not say to which group these participants were assigned. The one participant who had a secondary hemorrhage in the aminocaproic acid group and two of the nine participants who had a secondary hemorrhage in the placebo group also had sickle cell trait. Of the eight participants with sickle cell trait, five rebled. Similarly, in the topical aminocaproic acid versus placebo studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Pieramici-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pieramici 2003</LINK> reported that two participants in the aminocaproic acid group and one in the placebo group had sickle cell trait but again they did not report on the rebleed rate for participants with sickle cell trait/disease.</P>
<P>Initial hyphema severity was reported in almost all studies. Most investigators reported initial hyphema severity by the proportion of anterior chamber filled with blood or by the height of the hyphema in millimeters. There did not appear to be any overall pattern in the proportion of participants who had a secondary hemorrhage within groups defined by initial hyphema severity. Some studies reported no effect of initial hyphema size on secondary hemorrhages (<LINK REF="STD-Karkhaneh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karkhaneh 2003</LINK>), or that all secondary hemorrhages occurred in initially less severe hyphemas (<LINK REF="STD-Kutner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kutner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teboul-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teboul 1995</LINK>), while other studies found evidence of a higher proportion of secondary hemorrhages when the initial hyphema was more severe (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 1987</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-11 22:08:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This systematic review included 27 studies. Twenty of the included studies were RCTs, and seven used a quasi-randomized method to assign participants to treatment groups. The primary outcome for all but three studies was the risk of a secondary hemorrhage. The primary outcomes for this review were VA outcome and duration of visible hyphema. Secondary outcomes for this review were sequelae of the traumatic hyphema, including risk of and time to rebleed, risk of corneal blood staining, risk of PAS formation, risk of pathologic increase in IOP or glaucoma development, and risk of optic atrophy development.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Antifibrinolytic agents</HEADING>
<P>The use of antifibrinolytic agents, such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid, in traumatic hyphema is controversial because they are reported to reduce the rate of recurrent hemorrhage, albeit at the cost of gastric and other adverse events. We found no effect of any antifibrinolytic agent on VA measured at any time point. Neither oral nor topical aminocaproic acid had an effect on final VA, and neither did tranexamic acid. Hyphemas in participants administered systemic aminocaproic acid appeared to take a somewhat longer time to clear than those in participants not receiving systemic aminocaproic acid, although the numbers were small and conclusions unreliable. As expected, it took less time for hyphemas to clear in participants who did not have a secondary hemorrhage than in those who experienced a secondary hemorrhage. Antifibrinolytics appeared to prolong the time to resolution in both groups - those who had a rebleed and those who did not - but the evidence available was insufficient to make any firm conclusions about the time for a hyphema to clear in participants treated with an antifibrinolytic.</P>
<P>Oral aminocaproic acid appeared to reduce the risk of a secondary hemorrhage, but in a sensitivity analysis excluding studies that did not adhere to an ITT analysis we found a nonsignificant effect of this drug on the rate of rebleeds. Likewise, evidence showing an effect of topical aminocaproic acid on the rate of rebleeds was equivocal; although appearing to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage, the number of events was small. Thus, although there was some evidence supporting an effect of aminocaproic acid in reducing the risk of secondary hemorrhage, it appeared to be less convincing than reported previously (<LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK>). There appeared to be little difference in the time for a secondary hemorrhage to occur between patients receiving aminocaproic acid (oral or topical) and controls, but again the evidence is weak due to a small number of incidents. In addition, there appears to be no effect of either oral or topically applied aminocaproic acid on the timing of the rebleed or on the number of events related to the traumatic hyphema itself (i.e. corneal bloodstaining, PAS formation, elevated IOP, or development of optic atrophy). However, the small number of events renders significance testing unreliable. Unfortunately, there was insufficient evidence to conclude whether aminocaproic acid would be beneficial specifically for individuals with sickle cell trait/disease. Whether aminocaproic acid is useful for participants with sickle cell trait/disease is of extreme importance because such patients are at higher risk for elevated IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aminocaproic acid is reported to have several side effects including nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, conjunctival suffusion, headache, rash, pruritis, dyspnea, toxic confusional states, arrhythmias, and systemic hypotension. Its use is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant; in patients with coagulopathies or with renal diseases; and should be cautiously used in patients with hepatic, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular diseases. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events reported between oral and topical aminocaproic acid or between standard versus low doses of aminocaproic acid.</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid was not statistically different from controls in terms of final VA, time of resolution of hemorrhage, time of rebleed, or duration of hospitalization. Tranexamic acid is reported to have fewer gastric side effects than aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminomethylbenzoic acid versus placebo, with results suggesting that patients treated with oral aminomethylbenzoic acid were less likely to rebleed compared with patients treated with placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids have also been used to treat hyphema; the mechanism of action of corticosteroids is believed to be due to reduced inflammation, stabilization of the blood-ocular barrier, or direct inhibition of fibrinolysis, thus preventing secondary rebleeds. The effect of oral corticosteroids was evaluated in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rahmani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spoor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spoor 1980</LINK>), and the effect of topical corticosteroids in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rakusin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rakusin 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zetterstrom-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Zetterstrom 1969</LINK>). No significant differences in terms of resolution of primary hemorrhage, time of rebleed, or increased IOP were found.</P>
<P>One study compared systemic aminocaproic acid versus prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Farber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Farber 1991</LINK>). This study concluded that at discharge more hyphemas in patients in the prednisolone group had resolved than in patients in the systemic aminocaproic acid group. No other differences were noted between these two agents in this study, although the investigators did not follow the patients after discharge. </P>

<P>Two studies compared homatropine as a cycloplegic (agent that enlarges the pupil) to pilocarpine as a miotic (agent that constricts the pupil) (<LINK REF="STD-Bedrossian-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Bedrossian 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rakusin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rakusin 1972</LINK>). A secondary hemorrhage occurred in only one patient in each study. Such small numbers of events makes significance testing unreliable. The traumatic hyphemas took a longer time to resolve in patients receiving pilocarpine. No other outcomes or other miotics or cycloplegics were studied.</P>
<P>No effect was seen with the use of conjugated estrogens in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Spaeth-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Spaeth 1966</LINK>).</P>
<P>No statistically significant difference was reported in the risk of rebleed in patients who had received aspirin in comparison with those who had not (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study compared TCM versus antihemorrhagics (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>), but only measured a composite outcome of "cure" that was defined as complete resolution within five days, VA of 0.7 or better, and no rebleed within one week of resolution of the primary hemorrhage. No single outcome was reported separately and so could not be compared. Although the authors reported a positive effect of the intervention, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the biases present in the study and the use of a composite outcome measure.</P>

<P>One study evaluated the effect of raising the head (semi-reclined position) compared with right and left lateral positions alternatively on time of resolution of primary hyphema (<LINK REF="STD-Zi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zi 1999</LINK>). The results were inconsistent in that the hyphema resolved sooner when the head was raised for small hyphemas but took longer for larger hyphemas. The time of follow-up was not mentioned, and patients were not masked to treatment assignment.</P>
<P>Comparing moderate activity versus complete bed rest did not show any statistically significant difference in secondary hemorrhage occurrence, final VA, time to rebleed, or time to its resolution (<LINK REF="STD-Rakusin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rakusin 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1974</LINK>).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-05 11:36:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Our search strategy was comprehensive. We believe that we identified all or a high proportion of published trials of interventions for hyphema and that our review is reasonably complete.</P>
<P>There were only a few studies, or sometimes only one study, evaluating a particular intervention. For example, only one study compared a low dose (50 mg/kg) versus the standard dose (100 mg/kg) of oral aminocaproic acid, and one study compared aminomethylbenzoic acid versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2002</LINK>). Comparison of topical corticosteroids versus controls was evaluated in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rakusin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rakusin 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zetterstrom-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Zetterstrom 1969</LINK>), as was systemic corticosteroids versus control (<LINK REF="STD-Rahmani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spoor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spoor 1980</LINK>). One study compared aminocaproic acid versus prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Farber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Farber 1991</LINK>), and just one study compared conjugated estrogen versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Spaeth-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Spaeth 1966</LINK>). Comparison of cycloplegic versus miotic usage was completed in only two studies, with both comparing homatropine versus pilocarpine (<LINK REF="STD-Bedrossian-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Bedrossian 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rakusin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rakusin 1972</LINK>). One study compared aspirin versus control (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1988</LINK>). One study compared TCM versus antihemorrhagic agents as the control (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>). Only two studies discussed the value of monocular versus binocular patching (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rakusin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rakusin 1972</LINK>), and none compared binocular or monocular patching versus no patching. Only one study compared the effect of elevation of the head versus control (<LINK REF="STD-Zi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zi 1999</LINK>). These few studies made the application of meta-analytic methods unreliable or impossible for many outcomes.</P>
<P>Another limitation of the validity of some results was the lack of information on patients with sickle cell disease/trait. Two of the studies included in this review reported on the occurrence of secondary hemorrhage in patients with sickle cell trait/disease. <LINK REF="STD-Crouch-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Crouch 1976</LINK> mentioned that the one participant who had a secondary hemorrhage in the aminocaproic acid group and two of the nine participants who had a secondary hemorrhage in the placebo group also had sickle cell trait, but they did not say to which group the eight sickle cell trait patients were originally assigned. <LINK REF="STD-Pieramici-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pieramici 2003</LINK> reported that two participants in the aminocaproic acid group and one in the placebo group had sickle cell trait but they did not comment on their rebleed rate. The subgroup of patients with sickle cell trait/disease is especially important in that this group has been shown to be at higher risk for elevated IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2001</LINK>). It has been shown that even modest elevations in IOP are potentially deleterious in sickle cell disease/trait (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1979a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1979b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1979b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1979c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1979c</LINK>), and specifically that permanent infarction of the optic nerve with substantial loss of vision can occur in such patients. Careful monitoring of IOP is indicated, and early surgery to decompress the eye is often required.</P>

<P>This systematic review included 27 studies, 20 of which were RCTs, and seven were quasi-randomized studies. Overall, the risk of bias was higher in the nonrandomized studies in that the sequence generation and allocation concealment were inadequate. In many cases, the studies were not reported clearly, and in some studies, participants were inappropriately excluded from the analyses. </P>

<P>Our review found some evidence for an effect of aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid on the risk of secondary hemorrhage. In contrast to most reported reviews, the evidence for a preventive effect of antifibrinolytics on rebleeds was not nearly as strong as that reported in the reviews by <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK>. However, <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK> included RCTs, controlled clinical trials, and also observational studies, but did not take into account any biases in the individual studies. <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK> cited only some of the trials and also included observational studies. In all reviews, no effect of either aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid was found on VA. <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK> presented a stronger case for the use of corticosteroids for prevention of secondary hemorrhage than we report here or than is reported by <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK>. Our review agrees with most of the existing literature in that there is little evidence for the use of bilateral patching, topical cycloplegics, sedation, or bed rest, although these interventions often are recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2002</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-05 11:24:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-05 11:22:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Although evidence is limited, the data suggest that patients with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhage than those who do not. Complications resulting from secondary hemorrhage, such as glaucoma, corneal bloodstaining, or optic atrophy, can lead to permanent impairment of vision. This systematic review did not identify a significant effect on time to best vision or final visual acuity (VA) following hyphema. Moreover, oral aminocaproic acid was demonstrated to yield significant side effects including gastrointestinal upset and systemic hypotension, and participants treated with aminocaproic acid showed slower clearing of hyphema than participants in control groups among those who did not experience secondary hyphemas.</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid seems to be as effective as aminocaproic acid in terms of effect on secondary hemorrhage but with fewer gastric side effects. Data from the few studies of the effect of corticosteroids on final VA and risk of secondary hemorrhage in hyphema patients do not support the presumed benefits, though corticosteroid usage may aid in relieving the associated inflammation in such cases.</P>
<P>Taking into consideration the risk of side effects for various potential medical treatments (antifibrinolytic agents, corticosteroids, and cycloplegics) without the presence of solid scientific evidence to support their benefit, it might be reasonable to recommend their usage only in those patients with high risk of complications (such as sickle cell trait/disease patients).</P>
<P>Controlled clinical trials comparing nondrug treatment modalities versus placebo did not show a protective effect. We found no convincing evidence of benefit of binocular patching over monocular patching, bed rest over moderate activity, or elevation of the head in a semi-reclined position in the treatment of traumatic hyphema. Given that most of these interventions were used collectively in many of the studies presented, it was not possible to assess the extent to which any of these interventions may have contributed to any reported positive results.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-05 11:24:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There is insufficient high quality evidence from large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support the use of corticosteroids or cycloplegics and limited evidence for the use of antifibrinolytics in the treatment of traumatic hyphema. It is possible that topical aminocaproic acid or a lower dose of systemic aminocaproic acid (50 mg/kg instead of 100 mg/kg) may be efficacious in reducing secondary hemorrhage with a potential reduction in the risk of side effects. Future research with such agents aimed at assessing impact on final VA after the resolution of the hyphema, time to achieve final VA, cost, and quality of life (side effects and time lost from school and employment) would be most helpful to guide treatment recommendations. Ongoing or future studies on medical treatment of hyphema should particularly study sickle cell disease/trait patients. Studies with direct comparisons of aminocaproic acid versus tranexamic acid do not exist yet, and only one study compared aminocaproic acid versus prednisolone. Further research to study the additive effect of nonmedical interventions in hyphema management might be of value, because they are not usually used independently of one another.</P>
