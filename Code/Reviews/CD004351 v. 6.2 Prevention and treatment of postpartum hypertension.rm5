<P>Not enough evidence to know how best to treat women with hypertension after birth.</P>
<P>After birth, it is not uncommon for women to experience high blood pressure (hypertension), but it can have serious consequences. It can lead to stroke and, very rarely, death. It is unclear what causes hypertension after childbirth, or which women may develop the problem, although women with antenatal severe pre-eclampsia appear to be at highest risk. The review of nine trials found no reliable evidence to guide care for these women. Further research is needed, particularly as the problem occurs most commonly three to six days after birth when most women have left hospital.</P>

<P>Nine trials are included.</P>
<P>Prevention: Four trials (358 women) compared furosemide, nifedipine capsules, or L-arginine with placebo/no therapy. For women with antenatal pre-eclampsia, postnatal furosemide is associated with a strong trend towards reduced use of antihypertensive therapy in hospital.</P>
<P>Treatment: For treatment of mild-moderate postpartum hypertension, three trials (189 women) compared timolol, oral hydralazine, or oral nifedipine with methyldopa. Use of additional antihypertensive therapy did not differ between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 4.20; three trials), but the trials were not consistent in their effects. The drugs were well tolerated.</P>
<P>For treatment of severe postpartum hypertension, two trials (120 women) compared intravenous hydralazine with either sublingual nifedipine or intravenous labetalol. There were no maternal deaths or hypotension.

<P>For women with pre-eclampsia, postnatal furosemide may decrease the need for postnatal antihypertensive therapy in hospital, but more data are needed on substantive outcomes before this practice can be recommended. There are no reliable data to guide management of women who are hypertensive postpartum. Any antihypertensive agent used should be based on a clinician's familiarity with the drug. Future studies should include data on postpartum analgesics, severe maternal hypertension, breastfeeding, hospital length of stay, and maternal satisfaction with care.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-13 10:28:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Research has focused on the antenatal complications, for both mother and baby, and the risks and benefits of administering antihypertensive therapy prior to delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2002</LINK>). There is very little information on how best to manage postpartum hypertension, regardless of type or severity, to optimise maternal safety and minimise hospital stay.<BR/>
<BR/>The true prevalence of postpartum hypertension is difficult to ascertain, but the importance of monitoring women in the puerperium was highlighted by the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Conf-Enq-94_x002d_96" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conf Enq 94-96</LINK>), in which roughly 10% of maternal deaths due to a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy occurred in the postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2002</LINK>). In the 1997 to 1999 triennial report, one of 15 deaths was attributed to severe hypertension that developed only postpartum in a woman with antenatal pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Conf-Enq-97_x002d_99" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conf Enq 97-99</LINK>). Other complications of severe postpartum hypertension include stroke, and possibly, eclampsia. In a survey of all cases of eclampsia in the United Kingdom, 1992, it was shown that 44% of eclampsia occurs in the postpartum period, usually in the first 48 hours after delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1994</LINK>). Women with postpartum hypertension may also experience longer hospital stays and possibly, heightened anxiety about their recovery.</P>
<P>Blood pressure rises progressively over the first five postnatal days, peaking on days three to six after delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Bayliss-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayliss 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1986</LINK>). This pattern of blood pressure is thought to result from mobilisation, from the extravascular to the intravascular space, of the six to eight litres of total body water and the 950 mEq of total body sodium accumulated during pregnancy. Excretion of urinary sodium (i.e., natriuresis) has been observed on days three to five postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 1984</LINK>), and it has been postulated that this may result from an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP has roles in natriuresis and inhibition of aldosterone, angiotensin II and vasopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 1989</LINK>) and has been observed to rise during the first week postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Castro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castro 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>What causes a postpartum recurrence or de novo (i.e., new) postpartum presentation of hypertension is not known. Perhaps an attenuated increase in ANP plays a role. Five women with de novo postpartum hypertension were seen to have significantly lower ANP levels, compared with 10 normotensive controls (<LINK REF="REF-Nagai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagai 1997</LINK>). Another possibility is a failure to observe the expected postpartum fall in serum angiotensin I, an inactive intermediate of angiotensin II which is a potent vasoconstrictor. This was observed in 10 women with postpartum hypertension (recurrent or de novo) (<LINK REF="REF-Mizutani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizutani 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are iatrogenic causes of postpartum hypertension. Bromocriptine, to inhibit lactation, was withdrawn from the American market in 1994, because of numerous case reports of intracerebral haemorrhage and other vasospasm-mediated adverse events (such as myocardial infarction). It is plausible that the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for postpartum analgesia may contribute to the risk of postpartum hypertension by stimulating sodium retention (<LINK REF="REF-Makris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Postpartum hypertension may represent a continuation of an antenatal hypertensive disorder (regardless of type), or the appearance of a new hypertensive disorder after delivery. Although it is recognised that antenatal hypertension may continue into the postpartum period, the incidence with which this occurs and for what duration, have been poorly defined. For clarification, hypertension is defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or more. Mild-to-moderate hypertension is usually defined as a blood pressure of 140 to 169/90 to 109 mmHg, and severe hypertension as 170/110 mmHg or more. Hypertension in pregnancy (or the puerperium) is classified as: pre-existing hypertension (defined as that which antedated pregnancy or appeared before 20 weeks' gestation); gestational hypertension without proteinuria (defined as hypertension that appeared at or after 20 weeks, with less than 0.3 grams/day of urinary protein); gestational hypertension with proteinuria (also known as 'pre-eclampsia' or 'toxaemia'); or pre-eclampsia superimposed on pre-existing hypertension. Eclampsia is included in the pre-eclampsia category, and is defined as an otherwise unexplained seizure in a woman with pre-eclampsia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevention of postpartum hypertension for high-risk groups</HEADING>
<P>Women delivered with pre-eclampsia appear to be at increased risk of postpartum hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2002</LINK>). This was recognized by JS Henry in 1936, who pointed out that, "... in toxaemic patients, the postpartum fall [in blood pressure] to normal is very variable, but is apt to take longer in eclamptics and in pre-eclamptics" (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1936" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1936</LINK>). In the no treatment arm of a randomised controlled trial comparing furosemide with no treatment, 26% of women with pre-eclampsia were observed to be on antihypertensive therapy at the time of hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Ascarelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascarelli 1999</LINK>). An observational study of 67 women with either proteinuric or non-proteinuric gestational hypertension found that 50% of women had a blood pressure greater than 150/100 mmHg on day five postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1987</LINK>). In women who develop pre-eclampsia antenatally, postnatal hypertension lasted approximately two weeks (mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 16 ± 9.5 days). Although blood pressure dropped significantly in the first two weeks postpartum, there was substantial variability between women (<LINK REF="REF-Bowler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrazzani-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrazzani 1994</LINK>). Women at increased risk for recurrence of hypertension after delivery were those who delivered preterm, and those multiparous women with higher uric acid levels or blood urea nitrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrazzani-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrazzani 1994</LINK>). In a study of 80 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, the risk of developing postpartum morbidity increased with higher levels of urinary albumin and urinary immunoglobulin G (IgG), measured in the antepartum and intrapartum periods. In this study, postpartum morbidity was defined as one or more of the following: (1) need for greater than 24 hours of maternal postpartum intensive care or parenteral magnesium sulphate administration; (2) need for postpartum parenteral antihypertensive medication for blood pressure greater than 160/110 mmHg; (3) postpartum blood pressure of greater than 140/90 for more than three days; and/or (4) need for oral antihypertensive medication at the time of hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Eden-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eden 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared with women with pre-eclampsia, fewer women with gestational hypertension appear to have postpartum hypertension. Also, the duration of this hypertension appeared to be shorter (mean ± SD of six days, SD 5.5 days) than in women with pre-eclampsia. Again, the duration was highly variable (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrazzani-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrazzani 1994</LINK>). Multiparous women with higher uric acid and blood urea nitrogen appeared to be at higher risk (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrazzani-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrazzani 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is not known whether or not antihypertensives should be routinely re-instituted postpartum among women with antenatal hypertension in order to prevent postpartum hypertension. No international guidelines give guidance in this regard.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment of postpartum hypertension</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of de novo postpartum hypertension has also been poorly defined. In an observational study of 136 primarily Caucasian women who were normotensive antenatally, 12% had a diastolic blood pressure (dBP) greater than 100 mmHg during the first five postpartum days, with an average rise in blood pressure of 6 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1986</LINK>). In contrast, postpartum hypertension occurred in only 3.5% of 210 Nigerian women who were normotensive during pregnancy. However, excluded were women who were hypertensive within 48 hours of delivery. Of note, is the fact that of the two thirds of women who became hypertensive within six weeks postpartum, 70% did so between days two and seven postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Ojugwu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojugwu 1993</LINK>). Long-term follow-up was available for only 35 of the women (17%), most of whom developed gestational hypertension (N = 8) or recurrent isolated postpartum hypertension (N = 17) in subsequent pregnancies. Finally, in a case-control study of women readmitted to hospital with postpartum pre-eclampsia after a normotensive pregnancy (versus controls who were normotensive throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period), a rise in mean arterial pressure of more than 10 mmHg between the intrapartum and postpartum periods was associated with a greater than threefold increased risk of readmission postpartum with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Atterbury-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atterbury 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>For manifest postpartum hypertension, there is general consensus that severe hypertension should be treated (to prevent acute maternal vascular complications such as stroke), but no such consensus exists for mild-moderate postpartum hypertension (whether de novo or not and regardless of type), needs to be treated. The Canadian Hypertension Society recommends treatment for women with severe hypertension or symptoms, and those with target organ damage and moderate gestational hypertension (i.e., dBP greater than 99 mmHg) three days after delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Rey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey 1997</LINK>). The American and Australasian guidelines acknowledge the postnatal rise in blood pressure and the possibility that antihypertensive medication may need to be increased in women with antenatal (even chronic) hypertension, but they make no specific recommendations about when treatment should be started and what the therapeutic goal should be (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHBPEPWG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEPWG 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite widespread use of antihypertensives in the postpartum period, there is limited evidence to support their safety for babies of breastfeeding mothers. A review of the available observational literature (37 reports covering 41 different antihypertensives) concluded that the following drugs have minimal milk to maternal plasma ratios to make breastfeeding acceptable: methyldopa, beta-blockers with high protein binding (e.g., oxprenolol), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and some dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Beardmore-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beardmore 2002</LINK>). All of these drugs are used commonly in the postpartum period.</P>
<P>This review focuses on the benefits and risks of antihypertensive therapy for the prevention or treatment of postpartum hypertension. We will not address other therapeutic approaches (e.g., postpartum curettage) (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1964</LINK>) or magnesium sulphate therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Livingston-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Livingston 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrenberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenberg 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevention of postpartum hypertension</HEADING>
<P>Four trials studied (358 women) interventions for prevention of postpartum hypertension in women with antenatal pre-eclampsia (defined as pregnancy-induced hypertension with either proteinuria or adverse features such as haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome). Women with pre-existing hypertension were excluded from one trial and those with chronic kidney disease from another.</P>
<P>Two trials (282 women) compared routine postnatal furosemide therapy (20 to 40 mg orally per day, for five to seven days) with either placebo or no therapy. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ascarelli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ascarelli 2005</LINK>), 20 mEq orally per day of supplemental potassium was administered, and in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1997</LINK>), intravenous magnesium sulphate was given if the woman was considered to be at 'high risk' of eclampsia. Neither trial reported mean and standard deviation (SD) of baseline blood pressure, but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1997</LINK>) reported the change in blood pressure (BP) on days one, three and seven after delivery (i.e., -6.5 mmHg (furosemide) versus -3.5 (placebo) on day one, -10.6 (furosemide) versus -9.75 (placebo) on day three, and -11.5 (furosemide) versus -7.8 (placebo) on day seven). Follow-up ranged from day 10 postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Ascarelli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ascarelli 2005</LINK>) to six weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A third trial (31 women) compared nifedipine capsules (10 mg orally every four hours for 48 hours) with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 1990</LINK>). Women had mild hypertension at baseline, and at 18 to 24 hours following delivery, mean (±SD) diastolic BP was 93.9 ± 1.6 mmHg (nifedipine) versus 100.2 ± 2.6 (placebo). All women in this trial were on magnesium sulphate. Women were followed until hospital discharge.</P>
<P>A fourth trial (45 women) compared L-arginine (a nitric oxide donor) with placebo. Women had pre-eclampsia antenatally or postnatally and a mean pre-treatment BP of 169 ± 15mmHg systolic and 105 ± 8mmHg diastolic at a mean gestational age of 34.7 ± 4.0 weeks. Women received L-arginine before delivery and for three days postpartum; most women (30/45) were treated only postpartum. Women were followed to day three and day 10 postpartum.</P>

<P>Women in these trials were hypertensive postpartum, but the nature of the hypertensive disorder was not well described, and included both women who were normotensive ante and intrapartum, and those who had severe antenatal pre-eclampsia. Diastolic BP was moderate to severe in nature. Approximately half of the women delivered their first child in the two trials that reported parity. Women with comorbid conditions were usually excluded, due to pre-existing hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Griffis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Griffis 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1991</LINK>), renal disease (<LINK REF="STD-Fidler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fidler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1991</LINK>), hepatic dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Griffis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Griffis 1989</LINK>), need for intensive care (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1991</LINK>), or diabetes or multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Fidler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fidler 1992</LINK>).

<P>Five trials compared one oral antihypertensive agent with another.

<P>With use of routine postnatal furosemide, there was a strong trend for a decrease in the need for additional antihypertensive therapy (for blood pressure 150 systolic or 100 diastolic, or higher) on the postnatal wards (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.00; one trial, N = 264 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The direction of effect was the same for antihypertensive therapy at hospital discharge but the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12; two trials, N = 282 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>.1). The mean number of medical attendances during hospitalisation did not differ between the furosemide (14.9 attendances) and control (18.0 attendances) groups in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1997</LINK>); however, statistical comparisons were not possible because standard deviations were not reported. Mean postnatal hospital stay did not appear to differ in one trial (7.3 versus 7.6 days) but SD were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial of routine nifedipine capsules reported no significant difference in the occurrence of severe hypertension treatment between groups, but data were not provided (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 1990</LINK>). The trial of L-arginine versus placebo did not find a between-group difference in severe hypertension (or use of antihypertensive therapy on day three postpartum).</P>

<P>No trials were located that compared antihypertensive with placebo or no therapy for mild-to-moderate postpartum hypertension, of any type.</P>
<P>For treatment of mild-moderate postpartum hypertension, three trials (189 women) compared timolol, hydralazine (oral), or nifedipine (oral) with methyldopa. Magnesium sulphate therapy was administered for 12 hours postpartum in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Griffis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Griffis 1989</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-02-23 11:36:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the few trials that focused on the prevention or management of postpartum hypertension, there are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions to be drawn about the relative benefits and risks of different management strategies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevention of postpartum hypertension</HEADING>
<P>For women with antenatal hypertension, even that of pre-eclampsia, there is a strong trend towards reduced use of antihypertensive therapy in hospital with use of routine postnatal furosemide (with routine potassium supplementation). It is unclear whether there may be other potential benefits (e.g., reduced antihypertensive use at hospital discharge and/or length of maternal hospital stay) or potential harms (e.g., on breastfeeding).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment of postpartum hypertension</HEADING>
<P>For women with manifest postpartum hypertension (whether or not they were hypertensive before delivery), there are no data that inform whether or not mild-to-moderate hypertension should be treated, and if so, whether or not one agent is preferable to another. Certainly, two of the agents studied (timolol and methyldopa) are not in common usage postpartum. Regardless of the approach taken, the currently evaluated antihypertensive therapies appear to be associated with few women changing drugs due to maternal side-effects.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-03 10:38:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>For women with pre-eclampsia, postnatal furosemide may decrease the need for postnatal antihypertensive therapy in hospital, but more data are needed on substantive outcomes before this practice can be recommended. There are no reliable data to guide management of women who are hypertensive postpartum. Any antihypertensive agent used should be based on a clinician's familiarity with the drug. Given that peak postpartum blood pressure occurs on days three to six postpartum, clinicians should be aware that peaks may occur after hospital discharge and, therefore, may be missed unless close follow up is ensured.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-23 11:20:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials of prevention of postpartum hypertension or treatment of mild-moderate postpartum hypertension should randomise women to an antihypertensive medication versus placebo, before comparing one antihypertensive agent with another. All trials should include information about use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories after delivery, and examine the following relevant clinical endpoints: severe maternal hypertension, breastfeeding, hospital length of stay, and maternal satisfaction with care.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion, or, if required, we consulted a third person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors (S Sadeghi and LA Magee (LAM), or LAM and P von Dadelszen) extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third person. Data were entered into Review Manager (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=431502071916442198&amp;format=REVMAN_NOTES#REF-RevMan-2008#REF-RevMan-2008">RevMan 2008</A>) software and checked for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study, the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should have produced comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g., random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non-random process, e.g., odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g., telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Studies were judged at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We have stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (i.e., less than 2.5% of women were excluded from the analysis);</LI>
<LI>inadequate; or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcome(s) was(were) not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no; or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgments about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely to impact on the findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We had no continuous data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, levels of attrition were noted.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses carried out, as far as possible, were on an intention-to-treat basis (i.e., we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses). The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (i.e., I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50%), we explored it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>There were too few studies included and too few outcomes reported to assess the impact of potential reporting bias on outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis for combining data where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where we suspected clinical or methodological heterogeneity between studies sufficient to suggest that treatment effects may differ between trials, we used random-effects meta-analyses.</P>
<P>If substantial heterogeneity was identified in a fixed-effect meta-analysis, this was noted and the analysis repeated using a random-effects method.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>type of agent used to prevent postpartum hypertension (i.e., furosemide versus an antihypertensive);</LI>
<LI>treatment of mild to moderate versus severe postpartum hypertension.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following outcomes were used in the subgroup analyses: maternal death, maternal organ failure, severe hypotension, antihypertensive use in hospital, and antihypertensive use at hospital discharge.</P>
<P>For fixed-effect meta-analyses, we conducted planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>. For random-effects meta-analyses, we assessed differences between subgroups by inspection of the subgroups&#8217; confidence intervals; non-overlapping confidence intervals indicated a statistically significant difference in treatment effect between the subgroups.</P>
