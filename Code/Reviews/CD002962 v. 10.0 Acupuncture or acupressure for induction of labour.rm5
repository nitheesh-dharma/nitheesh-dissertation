<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Induction of labour is offered to pregnant women when it is thought the outcome will be better for the mother or her baby if the pregnancy does not continue and the baby is born. Common reasons for induction include the pregnancy going beyond the due date, pre-term or pre-labour rupture of the membranes, and concerns about the health of the mother or baby such as pre-eclampsia or poor growth of the baby. Some women look to using complementary therapies alongside conventional medical practice for induction. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points of the body while acupressure involves using the thumbs or fingers to apply pressure to specific points. Both have been used to help soften and dilate the cervix with onset of labour contractions. They may provide a way of reducing labour pain and avoiding a medical induction with other methods such as prostaglandins.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Medical inductions can have significant side effects. Many women therefore choose complementary and alternative methods to bring on labour. Acupuncture is practiced by many midwives together with usual care, and early studies have suggested a benefit from acupuncture.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>In October 2016, we searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture. We identified eight additional trials that were eligible for the review since the last version of the review in 2013. In total, we found 22 trials which reported on 3456 pregnant women. The authors rated most of the trials as having moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>Moderate to high-quality evidence found that acupuncture and acupressure did not reduce caesarean sections.</P>
<P>Acupuncture may promote a more favourable state of the cervix within 24 hours in the two trials (192 women) that looked at this. Only one trial reported on serious outcomes for the mother or her baby, finding no serious incidents in either the acupuncture or the control group (low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Acupuncture and acupressure do not appear to reduce the need for caesarean section but may increase the readiness of the cervix for labour. Acupressure did not help in any of the outcomes we examined in this review. The trials varied in the delivery of acupuncture and acupressure, the comparison groups, and the outcomes looked at. These variations mean that we have to be careful in how we interpret the findings. More studies are needed to determine if acupuncture or acupressure increases the number of women who experience vaginal deliveries within 24 hours and to examine the safety of acupuncture and acupressure.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-19 14:55:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction. The use of complementary therapies is increasing. Women may look to complementary therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points of the body. Acupressure is using the thumbs or fingers to apply pressure to specific points. The limited observational studies to date suggest acupuncture for induction of labour has no known adverse effects to the fetus, and may be effective. However, the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of this technique is limited.</P>

<P>This updated review includes 22 trials, reporting on 3456 women. The trials using manual or electro-acupuncture were compared with usual care (eight trials, 760 women), sweeping of membranes (one trial, 207 women), or sham controls (seven trials, 729 women). Trials using acupressure were compared with usual care (two trials, 151 women) or sham controls (two trials, 239 women). Many studies had a moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>Overall, few trials reported on primary outcomes. No trial reported vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours and uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes. Serious maternal and neonatal death or morbidity were only reported under acupuncture versus sham control.</P>

<P>There was no clear difference in caesarean sections between groups (average risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.15, eight trials, 789 women; high-quality evidence). There were no reports of maternal death or perinatal death in the one trial that reported this outcome. There was evidence of a benefit from acupuncture in improving cervical readiness for labour (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.69, one trial, 125 women), as measured by cervical maturity within 24 hours using Bishop's score. There was no evidence of a difference between groups for oxytocin augmentation, epidural analgesia, instrumental vaginal birth, meconium-stained liquor, Apgar score &lt; 7 at five minutes, neonatal intensive care admission, maternal infection, postpartum bleeding greater than 500 mL, time from the trial to time of birth, use of induction methods, length of labour, and spontaneous vaginal birth.</P>

<P>There was no clear difference in caesarean sections between groups (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.17, eight trials, 760 women; low-quality evidence). There was an increase in cervical maturation for the acupuncture (electro) group compared with control (MD 1.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.49, one trial, 67 women) and a shorter length of labour (minutes) in the usual care group compared to electro-acupuncture (MD 124.00, 95% CI 37.39 to 210.61, one trial, 67 women).</P>
<P>There appeared be a differential effect according to type of acupuncture based on subgroup analysis. Electro-acupuncture appeared to have more of an effect than manual acupuncture for the outcomes caesarean section (CS), and instrumental vaginal and spontaneous vaginal birth. It decreased the rate of CS (average RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.80, 3 trials, 327 women), increased the rate of instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 2.30, 95%CI 1.15 to 4.60, two trials, 271 women), and increased the rate of spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.56, one trial, 72 women). However, subgroup analyses are observational in nature and so results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>There were no clear differences between groups for other outcomes: oxytocin augmentation, use of epidural analgesia, Apgar score &lt; 7 at 5 minutes, neonatal intensive care admission, maternal infection, perineal tear, fetal infection, maternal satisfaction, use of other induction methods, and postpartum bleeding greater than 500 mL.</P>

<P>Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-09 13:09:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CM) has become popular with consumers worldwide. A recent review of 14 studies with large sample sizes (n &gt; 200) on the use of CM in pregnancy identified a prevalence rate ranging from 1% to 87% (with nine falling between 20% and 60%) (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2009</LINK>). The review identified use of various complementary therapies including acupuncture and acupressure, aromatherapy, massage, yoga, homeopathy, and chiropractic care. The review also showed that many pregnant women had used more than one complementary product or service (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2009</LINK>). Some women look to alternative therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. There is evidence of midwives having positive views towards CM, and seeing a role of CM for supporting women in labour and birth as positive (<LINK REF="REF-Levett-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levett 2016a</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, a recent survey found a wide variety of CM therapies are recommended to pregnant women by approximately a third of healthcare professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2014</LINK>). For some women with a prolonged pregnancy, an induction of labour may be perceived to intervene in the natural process of pregnancy, and may drastically change their expected plan of care during pregnancy. The reasons why pregnant women are interested in using complementary therapies to ripen the cervix and/or induce labour is an important question and needs to be answered when evaluating new options of care.</P>
<P>Acupuncture has been used for more than two thousand years in China and Japan. The diagnosis and treatment prescribed by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is influenced by the systems of medicine and philosophy of ancient China. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into the skin and underlying tissues at precise points on the body. The needle can be left alone, stimulated by turning in various ways, or stimulated by electricity. Electro-acupuncture involves the use of electricity to stimulate the acupuncture point. To do this, a needle is inserted and a terminal is attached to the handle, while the other terminal is connected to a second needle or neutral electrode. Acupressure uses the same points as acupuncture but applies manual pressure, usually with the finger or thumb, on these points rather than the insertion of a needle. Laser acupuncture is a non-penetrative form of acupuncture, which uses low power laser light to stimulate acupuncture points. Over time, different styles of acupuncture have been practiced by acupuncturists. Acupuncture treatment is composed of needling aspects (choice of points and needling techniques), specific components relating to the style of diagnosis and treatment used, and generic needling components not specific to acupuncture such as belief, time, and attention given to the patient.</P>
<P>In parts of Europe and Asia, acupuncture and acupressure have been described as methods to alleviate labour pains, and ripen the cervix. More recently, they have been used to stimulate the onset of labour.</P>
<P>Three case series have documented the role of acupuncture for the induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuei-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuei 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuei-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuei 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yip-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yip 1976</LINK>). Induction of labour using electro-acupuncture has been reported by <LINK REF="REF-Yip-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yip 1976</LINK>. Labour was successfully induced in 21 of the 31 women, with pregnancy duration ranging from 38 to 42 weeks. The pattern of uterine activity was similar to that of normal labour. In a second study, acupuncture with and without electrical stimulation was used to induce labour in 12 pregnant women with a gestational age from 19 to 43 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuei-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuei 1974</LINK>). The success rate was 83% and average induction to delivery time was 13.1 hours. In the third study, 34 term and post-term women and seven women with intrauterine fetal deaths were induced using electro-acupuncture. Labour was successfully induced in 32 (78%) women (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuei-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuei 1977</LINK>). The limited observational studies to date have suggested that acupuncture for induction of labour appears safe, has no known adverse effects to the fetus, and may be effective.</P>
<P>Two nonrandomised trials have examined whether acupuncture could initiate contractions in women at term (<LINK REF="REF-Kubista-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubista 1975</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Theobald-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theobald 1973</LINK>). In the trial by Theobald (<LINK REF="REF-Theobald-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theobald 1973</LINK>), four electrodes were applied to the skin of the abdomen to induce labour in the treatment group. Treatment was given to 27 women and compared with 102 women who were controls. In the treatment group, 20 (77%) women gave birth on or up to four days before the estimated date of confinement, compared with 47 (46%) in the control group. In the second trial, electro-acupuncture was administered to 35 women, and 35 women received no electro-acupuncture. An increase in the intensity of labour contraction frequency was observed in 31 women in the treatment group. In the control group, no increase in labour activity was observed (<LINK REF="REF-Kubista-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubista 1975</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-13 13:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism underlying acupuncture and acupressure to induce labour is speculative at this stage but may involve stimulation of the uterus by hormonal changes or by the nervous system. In animal studies, low frequency electrical stimulation of the neuro-hypophyseal system (the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland) induces the secretion of oxytocin. Parasympathetic (the system in the body that is responsible for bodily functions at rest) stimulation close to term has been shown to have an influence on the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1972</LINK>). Stimulation of acupuncture points is known to increase the discharge of thalamic nuclei (an increase in firing of the neurons in the thalamus) and the hypothalamic anterior pituitary system (the area of the brain that links both the nervous and endocrine system) (<LINK REF="REF-Liao-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liao 1979</LINK>). It is hypothesised that acupuncture neuronal (related to neurons) stimulation may increase uterine contractility either by central oxytocin release or by parasympathetic stimulation of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Tempfeer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tempfeer 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-28 04:42:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Induction of labour traditionally involves mechanical means (membrane sweeping, intrauterine catheter, artificial rupture of membranes) or pharmacological means (prostaglandin or synthetic oxytocin). Some women may seek to avoid these methods of induction, finding them uncomfortable, unacceptable, or both. There are risks and benefits associated with all these procedures. While membrane sweeping may result in women going into labour, softening the cervix and reducing the need for induction (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2005</LINK>), it may also be painful and/or not successful, and uncomplicated vaginal bleeding may occur following the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-De-Miranda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Miranda 2006</LINK>). While membrane sweeping is not pharmacological, it needs to be undertaken by a registered midwife or doctor. Other mechanical or pharmacological means of induction of labour may lead to increased intervention in birth and morbidity for women (<LINK REF="REF-Khireddine-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khireddine 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction were prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic) (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. It was agreed that subgroup analyses would be limited to the primary outcomes:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term, this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components were explored as secondary outcomes (see below).</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates, or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. No cluster trials were included in this update. In future updates, if identified and eligible for inclusion, we will adjust either their sample sizes or standard errors, as appropriate, using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6), using an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial, or from a study of a similar population.

If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information.

<P>For included studies, levels of attrition were noted. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-09 14:24:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis.</P>

<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-10-09 14:24:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar, or if the number of studies was small (less than three).</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-10-04 03:21:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If we identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses and to consider whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, to undertake a random-effects analysis. Subgroup analyses were not prespecified in the earlier version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Nulliparity versus multiparity;</LI>
<LI>cervix unfavourable, versus favourable versus undefined;</LI>
<LI>membranes intact or ruptured;</LI>
<LI>classical/traditional acupuncture versus single point therapy, or auricular acupuncture.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition, we planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Trials that recruited and treated women prior to due date (&lt; 40 weeks) versus those that treated women with a combination of pre and post-date or post-date alone;</LI>
<LI>trials that reported provided separate outcome data for primiparous and multiparous women.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We planned to use the following outcome in subgroup analyses: caesarean section.</P>
<P>However, in this update, none of subgroups specified above were analysed due to a lack of data in the prespecified subgroups.</P>
<P>We did carry out comparisons according to subgroups by type of intervention:</P>
<P>1. Manual acupuncture versus electro-acupuncture, for all outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-09-29 00:18:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where subgroup analysis failed to explain the heterogeneity, we planned to analyse the data using a random-effects model. A priori, we planned to perform sensitivity analysis on the results to look at the possible contribution of: (1) differences in risk of bias with trials having a low risk of bias across four or more domains compared to all trials; and (2) publication bias by country. If publication bias was present, we planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis excluding trials from countries where there was a greater publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data from other studies</HEADING>
<P>In the Rabl trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rabl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rabl 2001</LINK>), 11 (20%) women were post-randomisation exclusions and proceeded to have an elective induction of labour. In the acupuncture group, labour was induced for one woman because of fetal heart abnormalities and two inductions were performed due to pre-labour rupture of membranes. In the control group, two women requested an elective induction of labour, three women received an induction of labour because of pre-labour rupture of membranes, and in three women, labour was induced due to abnormal FHR patterns. Because data were not available about the post-randomisation exclusions and an intention-to-treat analysis could not be undertaken, no results could be incorporated into this review. In <LINK REF="STD-Torkzahrani-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Torkzahrani 2015</LINK>, changes in the Bishop's score were measured after self-applied or researcher-applied acupressure compared to usual care. Changes in Bishop's score were measured at 48 and 96 hours and at presentation to hospital. No data were provided on Bishop's scores at 12 or 24 hours and therefore could not be incorporated into the meta-analysis. The authors reported that at 48 hours there was a significant difference in Bishop's score (mean and (standard deviation)) between acupressure performed by the researcher 4.88 (1.83), acupressure performed by the mother 5.12 (1.92) and usual care 4.06 (1.59). This difference between groups was also significant at the time of hospital admission, acupressure performed by the researcher 5.95 (2.02), acupressure performed by the mother 6.02 (1.68) and usual care 5.02 (2.03).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-01 04:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Findings from this review were based on comparisons between acupuncture and 11 sham-controlled trials, and comparisons between acupuncture with 15 trials using usual care controls, or usual care plus sham. Evidence from 22 trials with data reporting on 3456 women suggested very limited benefit from acupuncture to induce labour. There was overall no evidence of benefit for acupuncture or acupressure to reduce the need for caesarean section. Subgroup analysis suggested a benefit from electro-acupuncture for reducing caesarean section rate when compared to usual care. The majority of trials did not report on any other primary outcome.</P>
<P>There was evidence of a benefit from acupuncture with increasing cervical maturity within 24 hours compared to usual care and to sham control. Data on cervical ripening provided conflicting results to those trials that were not included in the meta-analysis. Four trials used changes in Bishop's scores (<LINK REF="STD-Romer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torkzahrani-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Torkzahrani 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tremeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tremeau 1992</LINK>) and one used cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="STD-Harper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2006</LINK>). Compared to usual care, acupuncture showed a greater progression in both Bishop's score (<LINK REF="STD-Tremeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tremeau 1992</LINK>) and cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="STD-Harper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2006</LINK>). There was no change in Bishop's score when compared to sham control (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2008</LINK>). One acupressure trial (<LINK REF="STD-Torkzahrani-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Torkzahrani 2015</LINK>) found that cervical ripening (measured via Bishop's score) was increased in both acupressure groups versus usual care.</P>
<P>Overall, trials were characterised by heterogenous acupuncture/acupressure point selection and dosage. There was no evidence of benefit for acupressure for any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Although there have been more trials reported evaluating the role of acupuncture since this review was last updated, there continues to be a relatively small number of trials that have provided relevant health outcomes. This limits the power of the review to detect meaningful differences between groups and analyses, suggesting these limited benefits should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-01 04:53:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials recruited low-risk nulliparous and primiparous women at term. The majority of trials reported that women who were offered the opportunity to participate in the trial agreed to participate. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2008</LINK>, however, reported that 18% of women approached declined participation due to a lack of interest in acupuncture.</P>
<P>The systematic review documented wide variation in the delivery of acupuncture and acupressure. This included the mode of stimulation, duration of needling/pressure, number of points used, depth of needling, number of times pressure was applied per day, and duration of the trial. It is unclear how representative the treatment protocols that were used in the research are generalisable to acupuncture, as it is usually practiced. There was insufficient reporting of the rationale of the acupuncture used in the research setting. Some trials used a fixed approach to the selection of points whilst other used a flexible approach, with selection of acupuncture points based on their clinical presentation. The variation in the duration, frequency, and selection of acupuncture points suggests that the acupuncture may not have been therapeutically effective and, in some cases, may not represent best clinical practice. The variation may also reflect the country context in which acupuncture is practiced.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-01 04:56:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 'Risk of bias' tables (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) demonstrated that acupuncture has not been subjected to consistent rigorous study, however, the quality of reporting seems to be improving. Only two trials were assessed at a low risk of bias across all domains. The majority of studies were at a low risk of bias in respect to randomisation. Rates of attrition in the majority of trials were low with only three trials rated at a high risk of bias. The majority of trials were at a low risk of detection bias. Most trials were at a low risk for blinding due to the use of objective outcome measures and/or the use of blinded assessors.</P>
<P>Only one of the sham acupuncture controlled trials used a non-penetrating needle, however, these were placed at active acupuncture points and, therefore, may be associated with some physiological activity. The methodological quality of studies was also influenced by small sample sizes, with many studies underpowered to detect changes between groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence for the outcomes presented in five 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>). We were only able to assess the quality of the evidence for one GRADE outcome: caesarean section. Overall, the evidence ranged from low to high quality. Reasons for downgrading included limitations in studies, small sample sizes, and wide confidence intervals.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-10-01 04:56:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to minimise publication bias. Our search was comprehensive and we included studies identified in languages other than English. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some studies may have been missed. We acknowledge other foreign language databases have not been searched and there is a potential that some studies have not been identified.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-03 00:18:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two recent systematic reviews have examined the role of acupressure on onset and duration of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Makvandi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makvandi 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mollart-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollart 2015</LINK>). Both reviews focused on studies that included women in active labour, once contractions had onset, which are excluded by our review protocol. <LINK REF="REF-Makvandi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makvandi 2016</LINK> included 13 studies, while <LINK REF="REF-Mollart-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollart 2015</LINK> included a subset of seven of these trials. Both reviews concluded that acupressure during active labour showed benefits in reducing the duration of labour, while Makvadi also found that it increased the likelihood of vaginal delivery. There were no overlap between studies included in <LINK REF="REF-Makvandi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makvandi 2016</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Mollart-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollart 2015</LINK> and this review. One systematic review examining the effect of acupuncture on induction of labour and cervical maturation found all studies demonstrated labour induction by acupuncture treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2009</LINK>). The review included 10 studies consisting of randomised controlled trials, nonrandomised studies with and without controls, and a matched pair study. The review by Lim et al concluded a definitive role for acupuncture was still to be established and further research was needed. A recent systematic review of methods of induction of labour included our earlier Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>), and three other randomised controlled trials published since the 2004 Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2011</LINK>). The authors concluded that acupuncture for induction of labour is investigational, and no advantages have been demonstrated. Overall, all reviews identify there is insufficient evidence of a benefit from acupuncture.</P>

<P>Acupuncture does not appear to reduce the need for caesarean section but may improve the cervical readiness for labour. There was no evidence of benefit from acupressure in non-labouring women. The main limitations were limited reporting of health outcomes. Acupuncture and acupressure appear safe and the review suggests some potential benefit, however the specific timing and how many treatments remain unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-01 04:59:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Very few studies reported on the range of primary outcomes included in this review. Further research is required. We suggest future research additionally focuses on gaining a greater understanding of the specific components of acupuncture treatment in relation to working with women during the third trimester, particularly those who are approaching term, and at term. Appropriately powered randomised trials are required to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture on the clinical outcomes described in this review, especially in regards to the timing of measurements of cervical change, such as Bishop's score. Further research could compare acupuncture or acupressure with common conventional methods of induction of labour.</P>

<P>105 women were randomised to receive manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, sham acupuncture, sham electro-acupuncture, or no treatment. In the manual acupuncture and electro-acupuncture groups, the following points were needled: LI4, SP6, UB60, UB67. Serin needles (0.20 x 30 to 0.30 x 50 mm) were inserted to a depth of 15 to 20 mm with de qi sensation attained. In the manual group, needles were stimulated intermittently and irregularly by hand for 30 minutes. In the electro-acupuncture group, points were stimulated by an electrical stimulator with 2-Hz pulses of 0.5 millisecond duration for 30 minutes, sufficient to cause non-painful muscle contractions. In the sham acupuncture group, needles were inserted at sites adjacent to the specific acupuncture points to a depth of 1 to 1.5 mm only and insufficient to provoke an unusual sensation. The sham electro-acupuncture group were connected to a electrical stimulator but the current was not activated.</P>

<P>In acupressure and sham acupressure groups, pressure was applied on the points for 1 minute and it was interrupted for 1 minute as rest time, so that each point should be pressed 5 times. Acupressure and sham acupressure points were subjected to pressure respectively, and after the completion of acupressure and sham acupressure at each point, the next point was pressed. The total intervention time was 30 min. The bilateral method of pressure was applied on the points with appropriate force (half of the fingernails turned white) and this method was continued to create stimulation reactions such as hotness, drowsiness, soreness, numbness, pinching, and pressing.</P>
<P>In the acupressure group, pressure was applied to SP6, BL32 and BL60.</P>
<P>In the sham acupressure group, 3 ineffective acupuncture and acupressure points on the hands and legs were pressed.</P>
