<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Pain relievers for bleeding and pain related to intrauterine devices used for birth control</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding and cramping are the most common reasons why women stop using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control. A class of drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs) reduces menstrual bleeding and cramping in women who are not using an IUD. These drugs, such as naproxen and ibuprofen, are sold over-the-counter as pain relievers in many countries. Hence, researchers have studied whether these same drugs might reduce bleeding and pain associated with use of intrauterine devices. This might lead to more comfortable use of IUDs for longer periods of time. </P>
<P>We searched for and summarized all the randomized controlled trials that looked at using these drugs to treat bleeding or pain related to an IUD. We also included trials that studied the use of these drugs to prevent these problems. </P>
<P>We found 15 trials from 10 countries, with more than 2700 women studied. These drugs reduced both bleeding and pain with intrauterine device use. Whether one drug is better than another was not clear. Similarly, the best dosing was not clear. Preventive treatment with these drugs around the time of IUD insertion had mixed results. No serious problems were reported, but stomach upset and sleepiness can occur with this class of drugs. Because of their safety, low cost, and wide availability, these drugs are appropriate treatment for women who have troublesome bleeding or pain with IUD use.</P>

<P>Heavy bleeding and pain are the most common reasons why women discontinue intrauterine devices (IUDs). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual bleeding and pain in women without IUDs.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found 15 trials from 10 countries; the total number of participants was 2702. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, suprofen, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, flufenamic acid, alclofenac, and diclofenac) were effective in reducing menstrual blood loss associated with IUD use. This held true for women with and without complaints of heavy bleeding. Similarly, these drugs were effective in reducing pain associated with IUD use. In contrast, prophylactic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had mixed results; studies with ibuprofen found no effect on pain after insertion on IUD discontinuation. No important differences emerged in the one trial comparing the effect of different NSAIDs on bleeding.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce bleeding and pain associated with IUD use. NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if NSAIDs are ineffective, tranexamic acid may be considered as second-line therapy. Prophylactic ibuprofen administration with the first six menses after insertion appears unwarranted.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-20 22:11:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Abnormal uterine bleeding and pain are the most common medical reasons for premature discontinuation of the intrauterine device (IUD). The IUD is the most common method of reversible contraception worldwide (147 million current users) (<LINK REF="REF-United-Nations-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">United Nations 2003</LINK>), so premature discontinuation affects large numbers of women. Each year, an estimated 40 million women have an IUD inserted. From 5% to 15% of women discontinue IUD use within one year because of bleeding or pain (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 1996</LINK>). In a large trial sponsored by the World Health Organization, the cumulative net probability of removal of a Copper T380A IUD for pain or bleeding over 12 years of use was 36 per 100 women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). The corresponding figure with the Copper TCu220C was 34 per 100 women. </P>
<P>Both non-medicated and copper-bearing devices increase menstrual blood loss. Early studies found that non-medicated devices, such as the Lippes Loop, caused more bleeding than did copper devices, such as the Copper 7 and Copper T (<LINK REF="REF-Gallegost-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallegost 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guillebaud-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillebaud 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Israel-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Israel 1974</LINK>). More recent studies with the Copper T380A indicated a persistent increase in menstrual blood loss of about 55%. However, in Swedish women this did not lead to iron deficiency anemia (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 1995</LINK>). Some women view the increased bleeding as an annoyance. For others, increased bleeding may be unacceptable (<LINK REF="REF-Connell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connell 2002</LINK>). Although cramping is common in the early days after IUD insertion, this commonly resolves (<LINK REF="REF-Connell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speroff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 1996</LINK>). However, some women have an increase in dysmenorrhea (painful, difficult menses) with non-medicated and copper IUDs. In contrast, progestin-releasing devices alleviate dysmenorrhea for most women (<LINK REF="REF-Pakarinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakarinen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Excessive prostaglandin release in the endometrial cavity appears to play a role in both bleeding and pain related to IUDs (<LINK REF="REF-Ylikorkala-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ylikorkala 1994</LINK>). For example, endometrial concentrations of some prostaglandin metabolites correlate with measured blood loss in IUD users. Prostacyclin (PGI<SUB>2</SUB>) causes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Thromboxane exists in two forms: A<SUB>2</SUB> is active but unstable and is quickly converted into B<SUB>2</SUB>, which is inactive. Thromboxane causes vasoconstriction and blood clotting. Among Chinese women using a copper T IUD and having bleeding greater than 80 mL per cycle, endometrial levels of 6-keto-PGF1<SUB>&#945;</SUB> (a metabolite of prostacyclin) were significantly higher than those of women with either a levonorgestrel IUD or no IUD (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1992</LINK>). In contrast, the endometrial thromboxane B<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations were significantly higher in women using the levonorgestrel IUD. The authors speculated that the imbalance between the prostacyclin and thromboxane A<SUB>2</SUB> may play a role in heavy bleeding with IUDs. Another Chinese study correlated increases in 6-keto-PGF1<SUB>&#945;</SUB> with menstrual blood loss in IUD users (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. By decreasing production of endometrial prostaglandins, they can alleviate both heavy uterine bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2007</LINK>) and dysmenorrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2003</LINK>). Since the discovery of this effect of NSAIDS in the mid-1970s, several different drugs in this class have been used to treat or prevent heavy uterine bleeding and pain associated with IUD use as well. This review summarizes the randomized controlled trials evaluating an NSAID for these purposes.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1979</LINK> studied the effects of aspirin and paracetamol on menstrual bleeding in a group of 37 Swedish women, 10 of whom were using copper IUDs. Women did not have to have heavy bleeding for inclusion. Each woman received aspirin, paracetamol, or placebo for one month; women then crossed over to alternative treatments, so that each women received each regimen for one month. The outcome measure was menstrual blood loss as determined by the alkaline hematin method (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1964</LINK>). Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, has no anti-inflammatory properties and, unlike aspirin, is not an NSAID (<LINK REF="REF-Mayo-Clinic-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo Clinic 2005</LINK>). Paracetamol will not be considered further.</P>
<P>A trial from Los Angeles examined the impact of ibuprofen on IUD users without heavy bleeding or other complaints (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1981</LINK>). The researchers recruited 20 women, 10 using a copper IUD and 10 using a Lippes Loop. Participants kept menstrual diaries and collected sanitary products for blood-loss measurement by the alkaline hematin method. Each woman provided three months of observation: one baseline month, one month using either ibuprofen 1600 mg per day or placebo, and one month crossed over to the alternative treatment. The ibuprofen or placebo was begun at the onset of bleeding and continued until the end of bleeding, or a maximum of seven days.</P>

<P>A Danish trial evaluated ibuprofen 600 mg given before IUD insertion, four to six hours after insertion, then again within the first three days (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>). Fifty-five women having either a Nova T or a Gyne T 380 Slimline were randomized to receive either the ibuprofen or a placebo. A 10-point Likert scale for rating pain was used; one was the least pain and ten was the most intense.</P>
<P>An early U.S. trial compared prophylactic administration of naproxen with placebo for Dalkon Shield insertion (<LINK REF="STD-Massey-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1974</LINK>). Fifty women, mainly nulliparous (48), were enrolled and allocated to either naproxen or placebo. Treatment began at 2200 hours the evening before the insertion and continued with repeat doses of 300 mg 1.5 hours before insertion, two hours after insertion, and six hours after insertion. Paracervical block with lidocaine was routinely used, given the wide diameter of this device (24 mm) and the nulliparous status of most participants. Outcomes included the need for additional analgesia as well as a complex pain score (including a five-point Likert scale) developed for this trial.</P>

<P>A recent trial from Chile examined the use of prophylactic ibuprofen after insertion of a copper T380A IUD (<LINK REF="STD-Hubacher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hubacher 2006</LINK>). This large trial enrolled 2019 women in Santiago, Chile, who had never had an IUD before. They were randomized to receive either ibuprofen 1200 mg per day in divided doses or placebo for a maximum of five days with each menses. This regimen was to continue for six menstrual cycles after IUD insertion. The primary outcome measure was removal of the IUD by the 52-week follow up for any reason, although information was collected to document reasons due to both bleeding and pain.</P>
<P>A trial from Egypt compared three different NSAIDs in copper IUD users without a complaint of heavy bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Toppozada-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Toppozada 1982</LINK>). Eighteen parous IUD users were recruited for the four-month study. Six women were randomized to three different treatment arms: indomethacin, flufenamic acid, or alclofenac. Half of the women in each treatment arm began with the active drug, and the other half started on a placebo. After two months, each woman was crossed over to the alternative placebo or assigned NSAID. Thus, each of the 18 participants used an NSAID for two months and a placebo for two months. Participants maintained diary cards to record bleeding and pain.</P>
<P>An early prevention trial was conducted in Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>). In this trial, 160 women wanting to have a copper T200 inserted were enrolled in a trial comparing an NSAID (tolfenamic acid) with placebo. At the time of IUD insertion, participants were requested to begin taking either tolfenamic acid 600 mg per day in divided doses or a placebo in the same regimen. Treatment was to continue for seven days, and participants were requested to repeat this regimen starting with menses for the next three cycles. The outcomes of interest included both pain and bleeding, although blood loss was not quantified. Participants and investigators were kept unaware of treatment assignment by use of a placebo, with distribution of drug and placebo in coded vials.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1981</LINK> performed a randomized controlled trial with 48 participants in the U.K. Women had to have documented heavy bleeding (an average of at least 80 mL per cycle on two pre-treatment cycles) and a normal pelvic examination. The trial had three treatment arms: two different regimens of naproxen and a placebo. The higher naproxen regimen was 1250 mg daily in divided doses; the lower regimen was 1000 mg on the first day and 750 mg daily thereafter. Each woman received one of the treatments above for two menstrual cycles then switched to another regimen for two cycles. Hence, each participant used two of the three regimens over a total of four treatment cycles. The IUDs being used by the 34 participants analyzed included copper devices (12) and non-medicated devices (22); the latter included Saf-T-Coil (11), Lippes Loop (six), and Dalkon Shield (five) IUDs.</P>
<P>A recent Italian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mercorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mercorio 2003</LINK>) compared a standard NSAID (mefenamic acid) to a newer treatment: desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin is an analog of vasopressin with longer activity. This drug enhances blood coagulation by mediating the release of von Willibrand factor from endogenous storage sites; this increases circulating Factor VIII and platelet adhesiveness. It also induces uterine contractions because of its similarity to oxytocin. The trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mercorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mercorio 2003</LINK>) randomized 24 women judged by pictorial blood assessment scores (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1990</LINK>) to have bleeding more than 80 mL per cycle. All were wearing a copper IUD. Half the participants received desmopressin (300 mcg) as a nasal spray each morning for five days, starting on the first day of bleeding. Those assigned to mefenamic acid took 1500 mg per day in divided doses for five days, starting on the first day of bleeding. Participants were then followed for three months, with pictorial blood assessment scores as the primary outcome.</P>
<P>A Chinese trial compared indomethacin with a traditional Chinese medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2000</LINK>). Women using copper IUDs and with complaints of heavy or prolonged bleeding were assigned to receive either indomethacin 50 mg per day in divided doses or Baofuxin, a granular preparation of plant products, 16 g per day in divided doses (dissolved in boiling water). The treatments started on the first day of bleeding and continued for seven and 10 days, respectively. Participants kept menstrual diaries for 90 days before the three-cycle treatment phase and for another 90 days after treatment ended. The outcome was menstrual bleeding patterns as recorded on menstrual diaries; neither bleeding nor spotting was defined.</P>
<P>An early trial from Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Yarkoni-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Yarkoni 1984</LINK>) compared indomethacin 100 mg per day in divided doses versus placebo. Women with perceived heavy bleeding were invited to take part in baseline observations for a two-month period, during which menstrual blood loss was determined by the alkaline hematin method. Fifteen women had mean blood loss 100 mL or greater, and these were enrolled in the treatment phase. Participants were randomized to receive either indomethacin or placebo; a crossover to the other treatment occurred after two months. Over the course of the four-month trial, each participant received two months of each treatment.</P>

The type of IUDs was not specified. Participants were allocated to receive either naproxen sodium (550 mg initially, then 275 mg every six hours as needed) versus a placebo (lactose) for three consecutive menstrual cycles. The primary outcome of interest was pain, assessed by a self-administered six-point Likert scale, with six being excellent relief and one being no relief.</P>
<P>A Swedish trial compared naproxen with placebo in a crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lalos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lalos 1983</LINK>). Twenty-one women with primary dysmenorrhea and who noted increased pain after insertion of a copper IUD (either copper T or Cu-7) were enrolled. They were randomized to receive either naproxen or placebo for two menstrual cycles, after which they crossed over to receive the alternative treatment. The naproxen regimen was 500 mg initially and then 250 mg two to four times a day as needed. Follow up was sought after the second and fourth menstrual periods. Pain was assessed with a five-point Likert scale, and participants reported subjectively on their bleeding patterns.</P>

<P>Di Lieto and colleagues in Italy reported a "double blind crossover study" among 28 women with reported "increased menstrual blood loss and pelvic pain" associated with IUD use (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Lieto-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Di Lieto 1987</LINK>). The trial compared suprofen and placebo. Each woman had one pre-treatment month of observation, one month on the active drug or placebo, then the final month on the alternative treatment. In this crossover design, each participant took the active drug for a month and the placebo for a month. The IUDs used by participants included the Gravigard (Copper 7) in 18 and the copper T in 10. No quantitative or semi-quantitative assessments of bleeding were used.</P>
<P>Another trial from Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1983</LINK>) compared an antifibrinolytic drug (tranexamic acid) versus an NSAID (diclofenac sodium) versus a placebo. Thirty-one women complaining of heavy bleeding related to IUD use were screened by quantitative measurement of menstrual blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Twenty-one were found to have loss greater than 70 mL, and 17 of these qualified as having menorrhagia (greater than 80 mL). Two participants were excluded from analysis (one had leiomyomas, and the other had her IUD removed during the trial). Participants were studied over five cycles: two months on each active treatment and one month on the placebo. The dose of tranexamic acid was 4.5 g per day in divided doses, starting on the first day of bleeding and continuing for five days. The dose of diclofenac sodium started with 150 mg on day one of bleeding and 75 mg per day on days two through five. Placebo was also given for the first five days of bleeding.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1979</LINK> did not explicitly state that participants were allocated by a random method. We infer this from the description of "double-blind crossover technique." Correspondence with the author indicated that allocation concealment was ensured by using sealed envelopes. The adequacy of treatment blinding with the placebo is unclear. Four of 37 (11%) of women enrolled in the study dropped out: two because of pregnancy and two for unspecified reasons.

<P>The Danish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>) of prophylactic ibuprofen around the time of insertion featured a computer-generated randomization scheme. Correspondence with the author revealed that allocation concealment was assured by having pharmacy-generated envelopes containing pills. A formal sample size calculation was done in advance. Participants had a stratified randomization by type of IUD inserted. Blinding was provided by use of a placebo. No participants were lost to follow up.</P>
<P>The U.S. trial of naproxen (<LINK REF="STD-Massey-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1974</LINK>) featured permuted block randomization with a block size of 10. Allocation concealment was not described. The allocation to method apparently occurred some time before the IUD insertion, since two women assigned to naproxen subsequently changed their minds and did not have the insertion done. Blinding of treatment appears to have been adequate, with identical-appearing capsules provided in sealed strips. The sample-size calculation was not provided. All participants who requested additional analgesia were dropped from the trial at that point, leading to considerable missing data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Both bleeding and pain</HEADING>
<P>The trial from Chile (<LINK REF="STD-Hubacher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hubacher 2006</LINK>) was both the largest and most rigorous to date. Randomization was by random permuted blocks, and central pharmacy distribution ensured allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and investigators was provided by using an identical-appearing placebo. The sample size was determined in advance according to the anticipated reduction in IUD discontinuations by 52 weeks. Losses after randomization were low: 95% of women provided follow-up information at 52 weeks. Protocol violations were analyzed according to intention-to-treat analysis. More detailed analyses of bleeding and pain are in progress; only discontinuation is reported here as an outcome.</P>
<P>The Egyptian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Toppozada-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Toppozada 1982</LINK>) described randomization by computer. Communication with the author indicated that the sequence was generated by the World Health Organization. WHO trials of that era generally provided allocation concealment by using envelopes that were opaque, sealed, and sequentially numbered. The sample size selection was not described. No losses to follow up were reported. A placebo was used to keep participants and investigators unaware of the treatment assignments.</P>
<P>The Finnish prophylactic NSAID trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>) did not describe the randomization method, allocation concealment, or sample size calculation. Blinding of participants and investigators as to treatment regimen was done by having the drug and placebo distributed in coded vials; whether the blinding was successful is unclear. Due to noncompliance, many participants were excluded from analysis after randomization. For example, 160 women were enrolled and randomized. However, only 122 took the drugs at insertion and with the next menses as requested. By the second menses, only 103 complied with the regimen. Only 85 took the assigned drugs at the third menses. Because of this attrition, determining the number of women portrayed in the results is difficult. The analysis used cycles, rather than participants, as the unit of measurement for some statistical tests, which was improper.</P>

<P>The U.K. trial (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1981</LINK>) had a small sample size of 48 and a complex design, with three treatment arms and a crossover after two cycles. This led to data so sparse for some comparisons some planned analyses were abandoned. Fourteen of 48 (29%) of participants were lost or excluded after randomization. The method of randomization was not mentioned, and allocation concealment was not described. Although placebos were used to enable blinding of participants and investigators, whether this worked is unclear from the report, due to difference in numbers of pills taken.</P>
<P>The trial in Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Mercorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mercorio 2003</LINK>) reported randomization by "computer analysis" and allocation concealment by "envelopes." No sample size calculation was provided. No losses after randomization were reported. Attempts to contact the lead author were unsuccessful.</P>
<P>The Chinese trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2000</LINK>) reported that it was "double blind," yet no mention was made of a double dummy or other way to conceal the disparate treatments (one a bag of herbs, the other a capsule). The method of randomization was not specified, and no mention was made of allocation concealment. The sample size calculation was not provided. The lack of blinding likely biased the acceptability assessments of the treatments. Important losses to follow up after randomization appear likely; 90 participants were recruited to each treatment, but only 73 women in the Baofuxin group and 71 in the indomethacin group provided diary information. However, the report indicates that only one participant assigned to Baofuxin was lost to follow up.</P>
<P>The Israeli trial of indomethacin (<LINK REF="STD-Yarkoni-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Yarkoni 1984</LINK>) had no mention of randomization method, description of allocation concealment, or justification for sample size. Moreover, a large proportion of subjects discontinued the trial prematurely: of 15 enrolled, only 9 completed the planned observations. The report did not provide standard deviations for the mean blood losses observed, so these data were not entered into RevMan.</P>

<P>The U.S. trial of naproxen sodium (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1979</LINK>) for pain did not describe the method of randomization or allocation concealment. The sample size of 35 was not explained. Of 35 women initially enrolled, two dropped out for personal reasons. Six others did not use the assigned treatment for each of three menstrual cycles: three were unsatisfied with the pain relief provided, two had insufficient pain to warrant treatment, and one had her IUD removed. Overall, 23% of participants did not complete the trial as planned. Pain at baseline differed for the two treatment groups; those assigned to the placebo had less pain at baseline that did those assigned to the NSAID (P = 0.02), raising questions about selection bias. Blinding of the treatments was accomplished by use of a placebo; whether the placebo tablets were identical in appearance and taste is unclear.</P>
<P>The Swedish study of naproxen featured a placebo treatment and crossover design (<LINK REF="STD-Lalos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lalos 1983</LINK>). Correspondence with the author indicated that randomization was done with a table of random numbers. Allocation concealment was not described. Blinding was achieved by distributing the drug and identical-appearing placebo in amber bottles. A sample size calculation was not provided. Although the trial had approval of an institutional review board, informed consent was verbal rather than written. One participant was inappropriately dropped from analysis because of an intervening operation. Primary presentation of data was in a figure, and raw data were no longer available from the author.</P>

<P>In contrast, use of ibuprofen in asymptomatic IUD users reduced menstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1981</LINK>). The effect was stronger with the non-medicated Lippes Loop: mean menstrual blood loss was 30 mL less during ibuprofen use than during placebo use. For women using a copper device, the difference in bleeding was only 10 mL. No serious complications were reported, but one participant using ibuprofen developed edema around her mouth and eye, which resolved after drug discontinuation.

<P>In the Danish trial, administration of ibuprofen around the time of IUD insertion had no effect on pain (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>). Participants having three doses of ibuprofen 600 mg had median pain scores that were not significantly lower than those of women who received placebo; this held true at each of the three assessments. The median pain scores for the ibuprofen and placebo groups were 3.3 and 2.5 at insertion, 1.7 and 1.8 during the first four to six hours, and 1.1 and 1.1 on the third day after insertion, respectively. No important differences were seen in pain by type of IUD.</P>
<P>In an early U.S. trial, naproxen given around the time of Dalkon Shield insertion was more effective than placebo in managing pain (<LINK REF="STD-Massey-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1974</LINK>).

<P>Prophylactic administration of ibuprofen 1200 mg per day with the first six menses after IUD insertion had no impact on discontinuation rates (<LINK REF="STD-Hubacher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hubacher 2006</LINK>). For all reasons combined, 257 of 985 women assigned to ibuprofen discontinued IUD use with 52 weeks, compared with 246 of 977 who took placebo. These figures include spontaneous expulsion (113 and 125, respectively) and removals because of any pain or bleeding (112 and 91, respectively). At 26 weeks, removals for dysmenorrhea or increased menstrual blood loss were 59 of 985 in the ibuprofen group and 61 of 977 women in the placebo group. These removals were related to problems during menses, which is when the women were taking the medication or placebo. The two groups were similar.<BR/>

</U>In asymptomatic Egyptian IUD users, each NSAID tested reduced measured blood loss as compared with a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Toppozada-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Toppozada 1982</LINK>). The mean total blood loss over two months of placebo use and two months of indomethacin was 102.8 and 66.3 mL, respectively. The mean total blood loss over two months of placebo and two months of flufenamic acid was 101.1 and 59.6 mL, respectively. With alclofenac, the corresponding figures were 110.0 and 68.5 mL, respectively. Standard deviations for these means were not provided in the report. However, the authors aggregated all three groups versus placebo and provided standard deviations for these means, allowing for data entry in RevMan. All three NSAIDs decreased total bleeding as compared with placebo; differences between the NSAIDs were minor. Treatment did not shorten the duration of bleeding. Side effects were generally mild; four women assigned to indomethacin had complaints (including headache, nausea, and epigastric pain), one assigned to flufenamic acid had a headache, and two assigned to alclofenac had complaints (intestinal colic and dizziness). Pain was much lower during treatment cycles.</P>
<P>Prophylactic administration of tolfenamic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>) offered subjective benefit over a placebo. Bleeding immediately after IUD insertion was shorter by about a day, and fewer sanitary pads were required for protection. With subsequent menses, about 15% fewer cycles were deemed heavier than normal with the active drug, and about one pad fewer on average was required. Clots and pain were both less frequent with the NSAID than with placebo. Side effects were noted in both treatment groups. Dyspepsia and diarrhea were reported by four women taking tolfenamic acid, and five taking placebo noted headache. Three participants taking placebo complained of depression and fatigue. Discontinuations because of side effects occurred in three participants in the tolfenamic acid group and two in the placebo group.</P>

<P>Among women with documented heavy bleeding, naproxen in either of two regimens tested reduced measured blood loss as compared with the placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1981</LINK>). In addition, the pooled results indicated a decline in blood loss from pre-treatment cycles with both doses of naproxen. The pooled mean pre-treatment blood loss was 127 mL; with the higher dose of naproxen, 93 mL; with the lower dose of naproxen, 89 mL; and with placebo, 129 mL. The one patient who dropped out of the trial because of nausea and vomiting of six day's duration had been taking the placebo. No other side effects were reported. Individual responses to naproxen varied widely; some women experienced a 50% reduction in bleeding, while others had no benefit.</P>
<P>Mefenamic acid was comparable to desmopressin in reducing heaving bleeding associated with copper-IUD use (<LINK REF="STD-Mercorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mercorio 2003</LINK>). Both treatments led to similar reductions (46% and 41%, respectively) in bleeding scores, compared with baseline. Treatment responses were variable, however. All participants given desmopressin had reduced bleeding; two women assigned to mefenamic acid had a negligible change in bleeding. No serious complications occurred, but three of 12 women assigned to desmopressin reported headache and insomnia.</P>
<P>The Chinese trial found indomethacin to be comparable to Baofuxin in reducing number of days of bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2000</LINK>). During the three-cycle treatment phase, the numbers of bleeding/spotting days were similar (mean 28.8 and 28.3, respectively). Likewise, the numbers of bleeding/spotting episodes were comparable (mean 3.4 and 3.3, respectively). The report noted more bleeding/spotting days after treatment with indomethacin than after Baofuxin (mean 30.2 versus 24.7, respectively). A total of 13 women assigned to indomethacin and 12 assigned to Baofuxin had their IUDs removed during the trial because of bleeding, and two others in the indomethacin group had their devices removed for other reasons, such as cramping or pregnancy.</P>
<P>The trial from Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Yarkoni-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Yarkoni 1984</LINK>) found that indomethacin reduced menstrual bleeding by more than 50%. In the baseline cycles, the mean measured blood loss was 174.7 mL. In the placebo cycles, the mean was 159.9. In contrast, during treatment with indomethacin, the mean fell to 75.1 mL, a 57% reduction from baseline, which was statistically significant. No side effects were attributed to indomethacin or placebo.</P>

<P>Naproxen sodium improved uterine pain associated with IUD use better than did placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1979</LINK>). Of 17 women who took naproxen sodium in one or more cycles, 14 reported "good" or "excellent" pain relief in at least one cycle. In contrast, of 16 participants who took placebo in one or more cycles, only 4 noted "good" or "excellent" relief in one or more cycles. Daily pain relief scores for the 27 women who completed all three cycles confirmed better pain relief with naproxen sodium. The highest relief score possible was 18 (Likert scale of six, added for each of three observation cycles). With naproxen, the mean relief score was 13.9 compared with 10.8 with placebo (P = 0.03). Side effects or harms were not mentioned.</P>
<P>The Swedish trial of naproxen (<LINK REF="STD-Lalos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lalos 1983</LINK>) found it superior to placebo for pain relief. Of the 20 women with pain assessments, 17 reported better pain relief with the NSAID than with the placebo; only three reported superior relief with the placebo. Calculation of mean pain scores for the two treatments was not possible from published data. Subjective reports of bleeding patterns revealed little impact of naproxen on either amount or duration of flow. Side effects were similar for the two treatments: seven women reported side effects with naproxen, and five did with placebo. None was serious, and none led to trial discontinuation. Gastrointestinal side effects were noted in two and one women, respectively.</P>

Twenty-two of 28 women given this NSAID had moderate to "intense" decreases in bleeding, in contrast to none given the placebo. Similarly, with pain, 23 of 28 had moderate to "intense" relief of pain with suprofen, in contrast to only one of 28 with placebo. Three participants reported side effects (stomach cramps, one; nausea and headaches, two). The latter two participants were taking suprofen, but the regimen is not clear for the participant with stomach cramps.</P>
<P>The Finnish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1983</LINK>) found the antifibrinolytic drug more effective than either the NSAID or placebo in reducing bleeding. The reduction in blood loss was more than 50% with tranexamic acid, compared with only about 20% with diclofenac sodium. Side effects varied by treatment. The most common complaints with tranexamic acid were gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, and sweating. Complaints with diclofenac sodium included sweating, fatigue, dry mouth, headache, itching, and edema; one participant discontinued treatment on the fourth day due to leg edema. Neither drug influenced the duration of bleeding or pelvic pain associated with menses.</P>

<P>NSAIDS reduced bleeding in asymptomatic IUD users. Alclofenac, indomethacin, flufenamic acid, and tolfenamic acid all reduced bleeding when compared with a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Toppozada-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Toppozada 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>). In one trial, the reduction in bleeding was greater with non-medicated than with copper devices (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1981</LINK>). In contrast, aspirin had no effect on bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1979</LINK>). Despite the well-documented reduction in IUD-related bleeding, prophylactic ibuprofen administration had no impact on IUD continuation rates over the first year in the large Chilean trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hubacher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hubacher 2006</LINK>). Thus, the objective reduction in bleeding may not appreciably influence the subjective acceptability of IUDs.</P>
<P>The impact of prophylactic use of NSAIDs on pain is less clear. A recent Danish trial found no benefit of prophylactic ibuprofen at IUD insertion (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>), whereas a Finnish trial reported less pain after insertion with prophylactic use of tolfenamic acid than with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>). Naproxen appeared beneficial with insertion of the Dalkon Shield, but the relevance of this observation to contemporary IUDs is limited (<LINK REF="STD-Massey-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1974</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment trials</HEADING>
<P>NSAIDs also reduced bleeding in IUD users with heavy blood loss; naproxen (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1981</LINK>), indomethacin (<LINK REF="STD-Yarkoni-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Yarkoni 1984</LINK>), suprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Lieto-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Di Lieto 1987</LINK>), and diclofenac sodium (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1983</LINK>) all proved superior to placebo. Mefenamic acid was comparable to desmopressin in reducing heavy bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Mercorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mercorio 2003</LINK>), but the greater cost and more frequent side effects argue against use of desmopressin. In contrast, tranexamic acid reduced bleeding more than did either diclofenac sodium or placebo, but it was associated with more unpleasant side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1983</LINK>). The superiority of tranexamic acid over NSAIDs is consistent with the conclusion of trials with women not using IUDs (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most trials found NSAIDs to be effective therapy for IUD-related pain. NSAIDs found superior to placebo included naproxen sodium and suprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Lieto-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Di Lieto 1987</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Lalos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lalos 1983</LINK>). In contrast, one trial found no benefit of diclofenac sodium on dysmenorrhea (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence is insufficient to recommend a specific NSAID or regimen. Few trials have compared one NSAID to another, and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Toppozada-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Toppozada 1982</LINK>) that compared several NSAIDs found no important differences in effect on bleeding. Similarly, for women with heavy bleeding unrelated to IUD use, naproxen and mefenamic acid appeared equally helpful (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2007</LINK>). Hence, the choice of an NSAID may be based on other concerns, such as cost, convenience, and side effects. For example, naproxen sodium requires twice daily dosing, in contrast to ibuprofen, which is taken four times daily. Another Cochrane review concluded that gastrointestinal side effects may be greater with naproxen than with mefenamic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2007</LINK>). Similarly, for women not using an IUD, the preferred NSAID for treating dysmenorrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2003</LINK>) remains unsettled as well. An alternative approach to managing bleeding and pain with IUD use is to switch to a levonorgestrel intrauterine system, which reduces both menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pakarinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakarinen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>No serious harms were reported in these trials, although such reporting was incomplete (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2002</LINK>), especially in reports published in the 1970s and 1980s. The anticipated gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs did not appear problematic in the regimens tested.</P>
<P>Trial reports varied widely in quality, but reporting of randomization method and allocation concealment was incomplete for most. Attempts to contact investigators were largely unproductive, due to the age of the reports. Subjective outcomes, lack of blinding, and losses after randomization likely biased the Chinese trial of Baofuxin (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2000</LINK>). The claim of double blinding appears to be incorrect. Moreover, the report suggested a lingering effect of the traditional medicine for up to 90 days after discontinuation, which appears improbable.</P>
<P>If participants assigned to placebo took unauthorized, over-the-counter NSAIDs to compensate for their lack of treatment benefit, this would have biased the comparison toward the null. If this occurred, then the true differences between NSAID and placebo may be larger than reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>NSAIDs should be considered as first-line therapy of bleeding and pain associated with IUD use. The optimal NSAID and regimen are unclear, so the choice of NSAID may be based on cost, convenience, or side effects instead. Should NSAID treatment not yield the desired improvement in bleeding, tranexamic acid, where available, could then be considered. Because of its high cost, desmopressin should not be used. Existing evidence does not support prophylactic ibuprofen administration with the first six menses after IUD insertion.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trials comparing leading NSAIDs with each other might help establish the best approach. However, since few important differences are evident between NSAIDs used as analgesics, comparative trials of effects on bleeding or pain associated with IUD use should not be a research priority.</P>
