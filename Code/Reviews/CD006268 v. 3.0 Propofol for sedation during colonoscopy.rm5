<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Irrespective of the initial screening test, colonoscopy is the final step in colorectal cancer screening. With the advent of the colorectal cancer screening programs in many countries, an increasing number of colonoscopies are being performed each year. Sedation for colonoscopy can improve patients' tolerance of the procedure and enhance colonoscopy completion rates. There is no consensus on the preferred drugs for sedation during colonoscopy. This review found that use of propofol for sedation during colonoscopy can lead to faster recovery after the procedure and higher patient satisfaction, without any increase in side-effects as compared to the use of drugs traditionally used (narcotics and/or benzodiazepines) for sedation during colonoscopy. </P>

<P>Twenty two studies met the inclusion criteria for the primary objective in this updated review, in which we have included results from three additional publications. Many of the studies had a potential of moderate to high risk of bias and combing data for some of the outcomes was problematic. Most studies included only healthy out-patients. Recovery (11 studies; 776 patients) and discharge times (7 studies; 542 patients) were shorter with use of propofol. There was higher patient satisfaction with use of propofol (10 studies, 819 patients; OR for dissatisfaction 0.35, 95% CI 0.23, 0.53). There was no difference in procedure time (9 studies; 736 patients) or complication rates. There was no difference in pain control with non- patient controlled sedation (PCS) use of propofol as compared to the traditional agents (5 studies, 396 patients; OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.58, 1.39). </P>

<P>Propofol for sedation during colonoscopy for generally healthy individuals can lead to faster recovery and discharge times, increased patient satisfaction without an increase in side-effects. For the comparison of propofol administration by anaesthesiologists to that by non-anesthesiologists, we found insufficient high quality evidence. There is a need for better quality studies, with double blind randomizations, reporting of allocation concealment and more standardized reporting of outcomes. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-16 13:43:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most patients prefer the use of sedation and analgesia during colonoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2005</LINK>). The use of sedatives can improve the performance of colonoscopy and enhance colonoscopy completion and colonic polyp detection rates (<LINK REF="REF-Radaelli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radaelli 2008</LINK>). Traditionally, sedation during colonoscopy has been provided by the combination of a narcotic and a benzodiazepine. In recent years propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) has increasingly been utilized as an alternative method of sedation in endoscopy suites (<LINK REF="REF-Faulx-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulx 2005</LINK>). Propofol was initially introduced in 1989 and has since then been widely used in critical care units and emergency departments for providing sedation. Although, propofol is associated with a more rapid onset of action, its use for sedation during endoscopy by non-anesthesiologists in many parts of the world (particularly North America) has been limited by concerns of potential side-effects. Large case series suggest that nurses and endoscopists can safely administer propofol for endoscopic procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Rex-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>). There have been several small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing propofol with traditional agents for sedation during colonoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paspatis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Paspatis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reimann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reimann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sipe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sipe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulmer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmer 2003</LINK>). However these trials could have individually failed to detect significant differences in side-effects, due to lack of adequate sample size and power. Moreover, although individual trials demonstrated faster recovery with propofol, the magnitude of the benefit varied in different trials. A recent systematic review summarized the potential benefits of use of propofol for sedation during colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (<LINK REF="REF-McQuaid-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuaid 2008</LINK>). However, this review was limited to full publications in Medline and Embase and hence may have excluded negative studies, due to the publication bias. The prior review had several other exclusion criteria and the authors did not perform meta-analysis for sedation for colonoscopy alone. There is no prior systematic review of studies comparing the administration of propofol by anaesthesiologists to that by non-anesthesiologists for sedation during endoscopy.</P>

<P>This review is an update of the previously published Cochrane Collaboration systematic review (First published in the Cochrane Library 2008 Issue 4).<BR/>
<BR/>The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed (National Library of Medicine), EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, Biological Abstracts, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1980 to June 2007 for the initial review. The year 1980 was selected as the cut-off as propofol was discovered in 1970's and introduced in clinical practice in 1980's (<LINK REF="REF-Marik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marik 2004</LINK>). <BR/>For the update, the search was repeated for articles published between July 2007 and December 2010.<BR/>The following search strategy was used for PubMed and adapted to suit the other databases:<BR/>1. Colonoscopy [MeSH]<BR/>2. colonoscop* OR sigmoidoscop*<BR/>3. #1 OR #2<BR/>4. Propofol [MeSH]<BR/>5. propofol OR diisoprofol OR diprivan OR disoprivan OR disoprofol OR rapinovet OR recofol OR diisopropylphenol<BR/>6. #4 OR #5<BR/>7. #3 AND #6</P>
<P>Owing to the relatively small number of articles in this field, we omitted using an automated RCT filter in the search strategy; instead we chose to use the more sensitive approach of confirming RCTs manually.</P>
<P>Using the same terms, we hand searched the indices of conference abstracts from Digestive Diseases Week, the American College of Gastroenterology and the United European Gastroenterology Week between 1990 and 2007, published in the journals Gastroenterology, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gut and Endoscopy. Conference abstracts for the United European Gastroenterology Week for the years 1994 and 1996 could not be found and are not included. We also searched the reference lists of eligible RCTs.<BR/>For the update, the search was repeated for the abstracts published between July 2007 and December 2010.</P>

<P>Two investigators (HS, NC for the initial review and HS, EI for the update) reviewed the titles and abstracts of retrieved studies to identify randomised controlled trials involving use of propofol during colonoscopy that met the inclusion criteria for the type of interventions and participants listed above. Full text manuscripts of potentially relevant studies were then reviewed and data abstracted by two (HS, NC for the initial review and HS, EI for the update) authors working independently of each other. The potentially relevant non-English articles were translated by other health care professionals at University of Manitoba. Any discrepancy between the reviewers was resolved by joint re-review of the studies and discussion with a third author (ST). All potentially eligible, but ultimately excluded trials are listed in the final report, along with the reasons for exclusion. The 2010 search of electronic databases identified<B> </B>145 citations, from which two additional publications (<LINK REF="REF-Mandel-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>) were identified for inclusion in the review. One of these two additional publications was the full report of a study previously included as an abstract in the prior review (<LINK REF="REF-Mandel-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 2006a</LINK>).

<B>Data analysis:<BR/>
</B>Overall patient satisfaction, patient pain control, procedural time and recovery time after the procedure were evaluated as continuous outcomes. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated for the overall patient satisfaction, pain control and sedation level, as different measurement scales were used for these outcomes in the different studies. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for the procedural and recovery times and the maximum drops in blood pressure. Both WMD and SMD were calculated for discharge times. Both fixed effect method (Inverse Variance approach) and random effects method (DerSimonian and Laird approach - <LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) were used.</P>
<P>Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the dichotomous variables: procedural completion rate and individual complications. Both fixed effects model (Mantel-Haenszel - <LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>) and random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird method- <LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) were examined.</P>
<P>Some studies reported patient satisfaction and pain control as categorical events; others on continuous measurement scales, such as visual analogue scales (VAS). When possible, the categorical outcomes were dichotomized. The studies with dichotomous and continuous outcomes were initially analysed separately, and then combined to calculate aggregate measures; generic inverse variance method was used to pool the data and results expressed as odds ratios, using the methodology suggested by the Cochrane collaboration.</P>
<P>Results are reported using random effect methods.</P>
<P>Forest plots are used to display the mean difference and ORs of individual studies.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated with the Q statistic. Significant heterogeneity was defined as p&lt;0.10. Possible sources of the encountered heterogeneity including differences in the conduct of trials were explored. Pre-specified sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding studies published in only abstract form and by excluding studies which utilized patient-controlled sedation (PCS). Sensitivity analysis was also performed excluding the single study, in which anaesthesia was induced with propofol (<LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>). The alternate effect measure of SMD was considered for the outcomes (such as discharge times) defined differently in different studies.</P>
<P>Pre-specified sub group analysis, was performed for the studies which involved propofol alone in one of the arms of the study and studies which evaluated propofol in combination with other agents.<BR/>
<BR/>Review Manager Software version 4.2.10 was used for data management and analysis for the initial review and 5.1.2 for the update. Review Manager Software excludes studies with no events in both groups of a study from the meta-analysis; as such studies do not provide any information about relative probabilities of the events.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-06-16 13:45:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the 412 citations, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria for our primary objective. There was only one study, reported in abstract form comparing propofol administration by anaesthesiologists to that by gastroenterologists (<LINK REF="STD-Laquiere-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Laquiere 2006</LINK>). Eight studies evaluated propofol as a single agent. Seven studies have been published in only abstract format, including studies from 1994, 2000 and 2003 and the largest study (n=7,286 patients), which reported on different rates of colonic perforation. The abstract for this largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Jimenez_x002d_Perez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jimenez-Perez 2000</LINK>), which included more patients than all the other studies combined, did not provide information on our other outcomes of interest; we contacted the authors but were unable to obtain additional information.</P>
<P>One of the studies reported higher patient satisfaction, higher colonoscopy completion rate and shorter recovery time with the use of propofol, but did not provide any measures of variance (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Palli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Palli 2005</LINK>). Therefore the results from this study were not pooled with other studies. The recovery time from this study is listed in the additional tables, along with recovery times reported in three other studies, which also reported recovery times in a format which could not be combined with the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paspatis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Paspatis 2002</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK> ). Two of these studies reported on the extent of recovery at specific time intervals after colonoscopy and found faster recovery with use of propofol.</P>
<P>The abstract by <LINK REF="STD-Amornyotin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Amornyotin 2010</LINK> reported less procedural pain, shorter recovery time and higher patient and endoscopist satisfaction, but more cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events with the use of propofol in combination with meperidine than with the use of midazolam and fentanyl. However since the effect size estimates for these secondary outcome measures were not reported, the secondary outcomes from this study could not be pooled with the other studies. Of note, this study reported that all cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events were transient and with no sequelae.</P>
<P>Two studies had three study arms. For the purpose of the meta-analysis, the results from the two study arms with of use of traditional sedative agents were combined from the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>); similarly the results from the two study arms with use of propofol in second study (<LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>) were combined.</P>
<P>Two studies were published in non-English literature (<LINK REF="STD-Germain-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohlmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlmann 1993</LINK>). Only one of the studies was performed at more than one facility (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>). Six studies included patient-controlled sedation (PCS); propofol was used in combination with another agent in five of these (<LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2006</LINK>) and as a single agent in the sixth (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria varied. However, almost all studies included only healthy out- patients. ASA class IV patients were included in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Palli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Palli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paspatis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Paspatis 2002</LINK>), of which one could not be included in the pooled results (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Palli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Palli 2005</LINK>) (as above). One study included hospitalized in-patients (<LINK REF="STD-Pohlmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlmann 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The drugs administered in the traditional sedative comparative arms included benzodiazepines alone (diazepam, midazolam) or a combination of a benzodiazepine and a narcotic (pethidine, fentanyl, remifentanil or alfentanil). One study included only a narcotic (remifentanil) (<LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>) and all patients in the traditional sedative arm of this study remained awake throughout the procedure. The dosage of the drugs used varied.</P>
<P>The intended level of sedation when stated was defined in most studies as that needed for patients tolerance of the procedure. Few studies used an objective scale for the intended level of sedation (<LINK REF="STD-Akcaboy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Akcaboy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>). The goal was stated as deep sedation with use of propofol in the study, which reported on the incidence of colonic perforations (<LINK REF="STD-Jimenez_x002d_Perez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jimenez-Perez 2000</LINK>). Among the studies included for our primary objective, propofol was used for anaesthesia in a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>). In the only study included for our secondary objective of comparing propofol administration by anaesthesiologists to that by gastroenterologists, the anaesthetists administered propofol with the goal of attaining general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Laquiere-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Laquiere 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The patients in most studies received supplemental oxygen at a rate of two to four liters per minute, administered through face mask or nasal cannula. In three studies, no oxygen was provided at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohlmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlmann 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the studies for the primary outcome, propofol was administrated by an endoscopist or a nurse supervised by an endoscopist in six (<LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heuss-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Heuss 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohlmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlmann 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sipe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sipe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulmer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmer 2003</LINK>), anaesthesiologists in five (<LINK REF="STD-Akcaboy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Akcaboy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Germain-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Palli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Palli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paspatis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Paspatis 2002</LINK>), physicians trained in critical care in one (<LINK REF="STD-Reimann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reimann 2000</LINK>), PCS in six (<LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2001</LINK>) and the person administering the drug was not stated in remaining five (<LINK REF="STD-Jimenez_x002d_Perez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jimenez-Perez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Navas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Navas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heuss-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heuss 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amornyotin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Amornyotin 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definition of the outcomes varied. The criteria for determining post procedure recovery varied from the use of objective scoring scales (Alderete score in <LINK REF="STD-Akcaboy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Akcaboy 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>; Steward score in <LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>; Number connection test in <LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>) to determination of time to ambulate (<LINK REF="STD-Reimann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reimann 2000</LINK>). The criteria for determining readiness for discharge was often subjective and at the discretion of the recovery room nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Sipe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sipe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulmer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmer 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The included studies did not report on hospitalization rates or mortality and hence these outcomes were not considered further in the meta-analysis. Only one study reported colonic perforations among the study subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Jimenez_x002d_Perez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jimenez-Perez 2000</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-06-16 13:45:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one of the included studies was double blinded RCT, where all patients as well as all those involved in administering the medications and assessing the outcomes were not aware of the intervention in different arms of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2006</LINK>). Quality of allocation concealment was not reported in most studies. Three studies had adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Ulmer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2006</LINK>). In another study from the same group as the <LINK REF="STD-Ulmer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ulmer 2003</LINK>, the concealment of allocation may have been inadequate as blocks of four were used and could have been too small to prevent deciphering of sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Sipe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sipe 2002</LINK>). Many of the outcomes were subjective and hence there is an increased potential for bias, in absence of double blinded randomizations and concealment of allocation.</P>
<P>Four studies reported on calculation of sample size, a priori (<LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of eligible patients was not reported in most studies; this could affect the generalizability, if a large number of the eligible patients did not enroll. Five studies reported on the number of eligible patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kulling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laquiere-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Laquiere 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sipe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sipe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>). One- fifth of the eligible patients in one of the three studies comparing propofol to the traditional agents did not enroll (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>). One-third did not enroll in the only RCT comparing propofol administration by anaesthesiologists to that by gastroenterologists (<LINK REF="STD-Laquiere-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Laquiere 2006</LINK>)</P>

</P>
<P>Four studies with 249 patients reported on recovery time with use of propofol as a single agent. Three studies found a shorter mean recovery time with propofol with pooled WMD of -14.7 minutes (95% CI - 19.8, -9.6) and no significant heterogeneity among the studies (p=0.20). The mean recovery time in the traditional sedative arm of the fourth study was 0 minutes, as the patients were awake through out the procedure; this study in which propofol was administered for anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Moerman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moerman 2003</LINK>) could not be combined with the others in the meta-analysis. In sensitivity analysis, excluding the study reported only in abstract form did not alter the WMD (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Navas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Navas 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Propofol used in combination with another agent</I>
</P>
<P>Six out of the seven studies (527 patients) in this category reported shorter recovery times with use of propofol. The pooled WMD was -17.4 minutes (95% CI -29.4, -5.4); however there was significant heterogeneity (p&lt;0.00001). The study (<LINK REF="STD-Akcaboy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Akcaboy 2006</LINK>) which reported shorter recovery times with the traditional agents had very short recovery times in both arms of the study. From the description of this study, the starting point for the calculation of recovery time is not clear, as although the recovery time was defined as the time to reach an Aldrete score of nine in the recovery room, the patients were transferred to recovery unit after achieving an Aldrete score of nine. Excluding this study (hereafter referred to as an outlier) the heterogeneity was reduced, although was still significant (p=0.05) and WMD was -20.5 minutes (95% CI -27.6,-13.4). Excluding studies reported in abstract format along with the outlier study, there were five studies with pooled WMD of -22.6 minutes (95% CI -29.8,-15.4) and no heterogeneity (p=0.12). In sensitivity analysis, excluding the studies with PCS along with the outlier study, the WMD was -15.0 minutes (95% CI -22.6,-7.4) with no heterogeneity (p=0.40) among the two remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kostash-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kostash 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reimann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Reimann 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Propofol was administered with another agent in all studies of PCS included in the meta-analysis for recovery time. Three of the four studies with PCS use of propofol reported significantly shorter recovery times with use of propofol; the WMD for the pooled recovery time from all four was -23.8 minutes (95% CI -33.6,-13.9), but with significant heterogeneity (p=0.05). In sensitivity analysis, excluding the PCS study reported in abstract form, the WMD was -28.6 minutes (95% CI -35.7,-21.4), with no heterogeneity (p=0.92).</P>
<P>Five studies reported recovery times in formats which could not be combined with the other studies in the meta-analysis; the recovery time was shorter with use of propofol in combination with another agent in three and with traditional agents in the fourth. Most patients in the fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>) were fully conscious during the colonoscopy with traditional agents and hence did not need any time for recovery; the median difference in recovery time in the two groups was 2.5 minutes. </P>

</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity when the results from all studies were combined (p&lt;0.0001), which persisted when excluding studies reported in abstract form (p&lt;0.0001). However excluding studies with PCS and the outlier study (<LINK REF="STD-Akcaboy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Akcaboy 2006</LINK>), the WMD was -14.2 minutes (95% CI -17.6,-10.8) shorter with propofol, with no significant heterogeneity (p=0.41).</P>

<P>All four studies (297 patients) reporting discharge time, with the use of propofol as single agent in one of the arms of the study, reported shorter discharge times with use of propofol. The WMD was -19.1 minutes (95% CI -28.1,-10.0) but with significant heterogeneity (p=0.01). Excluding the studies reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Navas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Navas 1994</LINK>) or with PCS (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2001</LINK>), did not alter the pooled results or the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>However, as the different trials defined discharge time differently, a more appropriate effect measure may be the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD). The SMD favoured propofol (-0.90; 95% CI -1.24, -0.55), with non-significant heterogeneity (p=0.12).</P>

<BR/>The discharge time was significantly shorter with propofol in two studies and similar in one study (total of 245 patients in three studies); however the pooled WMD was not statistically significant at -32.2 minutes (95% CI -64.8, 0.50) and with significant heterogeneity (P&lt;0.0001). Excluding the PCS study (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 2003</LINK>) had no effect. Using the possibly more appropriate effect measure of SMD, there was a significantly lower discharge time with propofol containing combinations (SMD -0.69; 95% CI: -1.07,-0.31), with insignificant heterogeneity (p=0.13).</P>
<P>
<I>All studies </I>

<P>When results from all studies were combined, the discharge time was shorter for propofol (WMD -20.9 minutes; 95% CI -30.9, 10.8), with significant heterogeneity (p&lt; 0.0001) and no change when excluding the studies reported in abstract form or using PCS. The SMD was -0.80 (95% CI -1.04,-0.55) with significant heterogeneity (p=0.08). Excluding the two studies with PCS, the SMD was -0.78 (95% CI -1.12,-0.44), with significant heterogeneity in the remaining four studies (p=0.04). Excluding the study reported in the abstract form, SMD was -0.76 (95% CI -1.00,-0.56), implying faster discharge with use of propofol as a single agent or in combination with another agent, with borderline heterogeneity (p=0.10).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-04 20:48:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the presented meta-analyses, we found shorter recovery and discharge times and higher patient satisfaction, with no increase in complications with use of propofol.</P>
<P>The study quality of the included studies was limited in the areas of double blinding and/or concealment of allocation. There was a wide variation in the conduct of the studies and determination of the study outcomes.</P>
<P>We have presented meta-analysis of all outcomes; those with heterogeneity should be viewed with some caution. However the heterogeneity among the studies for many of the outcomes (recovery time, discharge time, pain control and sedation level) could be largely explained by sub-group and sensitivity analyses. The sub-group and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori. The heterogeneity was often due to pooling of results from studies with PCS, use of propofol in combination with another agent and/or studies reported in abstract format. However there was no heterogeneity for patient satisfaction, procedure completion or for most of the complications, with higher patient satisfaction with use of propofol and no difference in the procedure completion or complication rates. The heterogeneity among the studies for procedure duration could not be explained; hence it is unclear in what setting the procedure duration would be different with propofol compared to traditional agents. There was one study each for colonic perforations and anaesthesiologist vs. non-anesthesiologist administration of propofol; and therefore more data are needed for definitive conclusions.</P>
<P>Although it is generally suggested that sub-group and sensitivity analysis should be viewed with caution, we had planned a priori sensitivity and sub-group analysis to separate out the effects of propofol use as a single agent and propofol use as PCS. Therefore we believe the results of these sub-group analyses are valid. We had also planned to perform sensitivity analysis excluding studies reported in abstract form. The results reported in abstract form are often preliminary and can be different from the final results reported in full publications. However, the Cochrane Collaboration traditionally recommended including abstracts in the main analyses to avoid one of the potential sources of publication bias; negative studies may never get published in full format due to publication bias.</P>
<P>There were no language restrictions in this meta-analysis and we also attempted to obtain all studies published in abstract format. This supplements one previous systematic review,(<LINK REF="REF-McQuaid-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuaid 2008</LINK>) which was limited to fully published studies in English literature and sedative agents currently available in US. The search strategy of this previous review and meta-analysis was limited to articles in Embase and Medline. More-over the previous review did not perform meta-analysis for sedation for colonoscopy alone and reported most outcomes combined for colonoscopy and EGD. The previous review did list three studies for the outcome of recovery time after colonoscopy, with use of propofol alone. Two of these three studies were from the same group of investigators and the third did not report recovery time separately for colonoscopies (<LINK REF="REF-McQuaid-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuaid 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riphaus-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Riphaus 2006</LINK>). There are no prior systematic reviews comparing propofol administration by anaesthesiologists and non-anesthesiologists.</P>
<P>The recovery time in this review was about 15 minutes shorter with propofol as a single agent. The recovery time with use of propofol in combination with another agent was shorter than with traditional agents in all but two studies--one of these two studies had exceedingly short recovery times for all patients and in the second study, most patients administered the traditional agents remained conscious throughout the procedure (and hence needed no time to recover). The recovery time was 15 minutes shorter with propofol (as a single agent or in combination with another agent), when the studies using propofol for PCS were excluded. The pooled recovery time was also shorter for PCS use of propofol in the three studies reported as complete publications.</P>
<P>The discharge time was often defined subjectively and reported differently. Hence SMD is a more appropriate measure for determining the difference in discharge times. We initially calculated WMD, as WMD is an easier measure to understand and provides an idea of the absolute difference in the discharge times. Using SMD, the discharge was shorter with use of propofol as a single agent or in combination with another agent, when these two groups of studies were analysed separately.</P>
<P>The procedure time was comparable in most of the studies. The heterogeneity among the studies may have been due to the different experiences of the endoscopists or due to differences in the conduct of the studies. However the cecal intubation rate was close to 99% in these studies, suggesting that all involved endoscopists were experts. The higher colonoscopy completion rate with the use of propofol reported in a recent large study from Thailand needs further follow-up; this study has so far been reported only in the abstract format.</P>
<P>Based on the results for recovery, discharge and procedure times, propofol use may provide a distinct advantage to endoscopy units, where the throughput of procedures is limited by the availability of recovery room resources. Faster turnover of patients through such endoscopy suites using propofol may help meet some of the increasing demands for endoscopy.</P>
<P>On pooling the results from all studies, patient satisfaction was higher with propofol. Patient satisfaction was higher irrespective of whether propofol was used as a single agent or propofol was administered with another agent. Patient satisfaction was also higher with use of propofol for PCS, as compared to the use of traditional agents. Higher patient satisfaction with sedation and endoscopy may lead to higher patient acceptance and compliance with subsequent endoscopies. This would be of particular importance for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, where the participants often need multiple endoscopies. However additional studies are needed to determine the predictors of patient acceptance of repeat endoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Condon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condon 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies included in this review, assessed and reported pain control. However propofol provides no analgesia. The pain control in studies using propofol as single agent may have been a reflection of patients' inability to remember pain (propofol has amnestic properties). Alternatively deeper levels on sedation/anaesthesia will suppress physiological brain functions, including ability to register pain (<LINK REF="REF-Shafer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafer 2008</LINK>). If the pain control is due to amnestic properties, the autonomic responses to pain may still manifest during the procedure itself.</P>
<P>We found no difference in pain control in the non-PCS studies. In studies with PCS, the pain control was better with traditional agents. In all of the PCS studies reporting on pain control, propofol was administered by PCS, where as traditional sedatives were administered by bolus injections. Pain during colonoscopy is often transient and worse pain control with PCS could be secondary to a lockout period (minimum time between doses). Lockout period could prevent delivery of the medications during the episode of pain. However, three of the four PCS studies reporting on pain control did not have any lockout period. Alternatively patients could experience more pain with PCS, as patients administer the drug in response to a stimulus and therefore by definition experience the pain prior to PCS. We did not evaluate directly the comparison of PCS administration to bolus administration of a particular drug.</P>
<P>There was no difference in the complication rates between patients administered propofol and those administered traditional sedatives. However we would like to point out the patients in the included studies were generally selected to be healthy. The results of this meta-analysis in this regard are similar to the low complication rates reported in large patient series with propofol involving healthy patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rex-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>). A study involving sicker patients had a higher complication rate than reported in these earlier series (<LINK REF="REF-Wehrmann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wehrmann 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intended level of sedation in most studies was determined by the patient tolerance of the procedure. Although this is reflective of the clinical practice, this goal is a subjective endpoint. In the absence of double blind randomizations, this subjective goal for sedation may introduce a conscious or subconscious bias into the amount of drug(s) administered.</P>
<P>The mean level of sedation was higher when propofol was used as a single agent, than with the traditional agents. On the other hand the mean level of sedation was lower when propofol was used in combination with another agent, as compared to the traditional agents. We did not directly compare the sedation level between those administered propofol as a single agent and those administered propofol in combination with another agent.</P>
<P>Most large observational case series have reported on use of propofol as a single agent for sedation during endoscopy. However propofol is often used in combination with another agent for other indications. Our meta-analysis suggests that the benefit of propofol in terms of shorter recovery and discharge times and higher patient satisfaction persists, when it is used in combination with other agents. Propofol has limited analgesic effect and higher doses are often required, when it is used as a single agent for colonoscopy, resulting in higher sedation levels. Thus use of propofol in combination with other agents may be preferable to propofol alone. The combination may be easier to manage due to lower sedation levels and ability to reverse some of the sedation with the use of reversal agents for narcotics and/or benzodiazepines. However propofol used in combination with another agent and propofol alone is more objectively compared in direct head-to-head randomised studies.</P>
<P>We found only one study for our secondary objective, comparison of propofol administration by anaesthesiologists to that by endoscopists. This is a hotly debated area among anaesthesiologists and endoscopists, at least in North America. More data directly comparing and evaluating the risks and benefits are needed. Ideally such studies should aim for a similar end-point for sedation administration by anaesthesiologists and endoscopists. In the only reported study anaesthesiologists aimed for general anaesthesia and endoscopists for sedation. Although this may be reflective of usual clinical practice at many places, this does not provide direct comparison of outcomes due to the difference in the personnel administering the drug.</P>
<P>Sedation for endoscopy has been a largely neglected area in terms of research until very recently. There were no guidelines for training. Increasing acceptance of propofol for sedation for endoscopy has prompted renewed interest in sedation for endoscopy, as propofol has a relatively narrow window between efficacy and side-effects. Adequate training in administration of the sedative agents, monitoring during sedation and the ability to recover patients from deeper levels of sedation have received increasing attention.</P>
<P>One of the limitations of the current meta-analysis is the inability to determine the effect of individual traditional agents. There were a limited number of studies for each specific agent administered in similar manner. Some of the unexplained heterogeneity among the studies may be due to the differences in the specific traditional agents. Agents such as diazepam and meperidine have longer duration of effect than midazolam and fentanyl respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Propofol for sedation during colonoscopy for generally healthy individuals can lead to faster recovery and discharge times, increased patient satisfaction without an increase in side-effects. <BR/>Propofol is a reasonable option for sedation during colonoscopy for generally healthy individuals.<BR/>Propofol may provide an advantage to endoscopy units, where the throughput of procedures is limited by the availability of recovery room resources. Faster turnover of patients through such endoscopy suites using propofol may help meet some of the increasing demands for endoscopy. Moreover higher patient satisfaction when propofol is used for sedation during colonoscopy may also lead to higher patient compliance with subsequent endoscopies. <BR/>Differences in patient outcomes depend upon not only on the choice of the sedative agent, but also on how the particular sedative agent is used</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-16 13:46:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for better quality studies, with double blind randomizations, reporting of allocation concealment and more standardized reporting of outcomes. There are little direct comparative data on administration of propofol by anaesthesiologists to that by non-anesthesiologists, in terms of efficacy, efficiency, cost or side-effect profiles.The higher colonoscopy completion rate with the use of propofol reported in a recent large study from Thailand needs further follow-up to determine the generalizability to other settings. </P>

<P>4) Patient, nurse and endoscopist satisfaction: After full recovery of the patient, satisfaction scores regarding sedation from the patient, nurse and endoscopist were documented, using a 10 cm VAS, ranging from 0 (very unsatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied)</P>
<P>5) Pain: as reported by the patients on a similar scale.</P>
<P>The continuous outcome variables (procedure time, recovery time, patient satisfaction, pain score, level of sedation) were reported as median and range. As per the Cochrane collaboration handbook, ranges should not be used to calculate SDs and hence these were not included in the meta-analyses. </P>
<P>For the review, we extracted the level of sedation as dichotomous outcome, with "failure to sedate" considered as those with OSSA score of 5 during colonoscopy intubation. </P>
