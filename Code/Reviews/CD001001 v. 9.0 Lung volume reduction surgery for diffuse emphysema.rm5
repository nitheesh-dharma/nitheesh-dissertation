The review is almost ready to be sent to peer referees, but the summary of findings table is not quite right. I have made some tracked changes and listed below the issues that need addressing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I noted some discrepancies between the number of participants and trials between the analyses and the SOF - please check this carefully yourself to ensure it is now correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. For you for your continuous outcomes (SGRQ, 6MWD, FEV1, RV and TLC) you need to give an estimate of the assumed/control risk for each of the outcomes. This helps the reader to understand the magnitude of the difference between intervention and control when looking at the SOF in isolation. The assumed risk could be a median, a weighted mean or a range from the control groups of the studies that contribute to this outcome - whichever you think is most appropriate. As an example, I have completed the walking distance one for you (as it was an SMD analysis, I removed the Hillerdal - which used a shuttle walk - for the purpose of 'back calculating' the metres from the SD to give an estimate in natural units for the four studies reporting 6MWD). This can be a bit trickier for outcomes that are change from baseline or entered using GIV - you may be required going back to the original paper for the estimate. Please add a footnote or comment to explain where you found/how you calculated the assumed risk in each case - let us know if you have any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC June 7th; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;thank you for revising the wording for mortality. We have to be careful not to put too much weight onto the P values, as the point estimates for the last two groups were both very similar (RR around 12) so we cannot say there is any difference between them. Let's see what Peer reviewers think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC second stats and RN editorial check May 20th: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are two main issues to address before the review is ready for peer review: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Reporting of subgroups from NETT: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&amp;quot;Three month follow up:&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;NETT 2003&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;NETT 2003&lt;/a&gt; provided differences in mortality for three months for each of the subgroups indicating &lt;span&gt;no increased risk of early mortality for participants suffering from upper lobe predominant emphysema regardless of their exercise status; low exercise capacity, OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.23 to 3.29; participants = 290) and high exercise capacity, OR 3.17 (95% CI 0.63 to 15.86; participants = 419). Participants suffering from non-upper lobe predominant emphysema with low exercise didn't show an increased risk in early mortality either, OR 12.68, (95% CI 0.71 to 226.19; participants = 149). The only subgroup with a higher risk of early mortality when treated with LVRS consisted of participants with non-upper lobe emphysema and high exercise capacity, OR 12.35 (95% CI 1.57 to 97.37; participants = 220).&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;I do not think you can say that an OR of 12.68 &amp;quot;did not show an increase in mortality&amp;quot;. When compared to the OR of 12.35 for high exercise capacity, the risk is the same. The point estimates are the same and the latter has a narrower confidence interval, but this should not be interpreted as showing a difference between the subgroups (as this depends on power in each subgroup). Both subgroups have a point estimate of increased risk. Without formal tests of difference between groups you are on very shaky ground here. Please revise this and associated comment in the abstract. Similarly it is not correct to say there was no increased risk of early mortality in either subgroup with upper lobe predominant emphysema, as the 95% CI includes a possible increase in both low and high exercise capacity subgroups.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;- JVA: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I have reworded the paragraph to talk about mortality rates rather than risk. I never meant the paragraph to come across as trying to prove differences between groups, but rather as differences in mortality between LVRS and control divided by subgroup. NETT uses RR, while for this review we use OR. The OR&amp;#8217;s were calculated in Revman in a separate file (not in the review) using the information provided in NETT. The OR 12.68 has a significance value of p=0.08, while the OR of 12.35 has a significance value of p=0.02. I have reworded the abstract.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mortality in subgroups: end of follow up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please re-visit the highlighted section below in the results as it does not match with Fig 5/Analysis 1.5 (I think you have mixed up the high and low exercise capacity groups)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-JVA: &lt;/b&gt;- Corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Participants with non-upper lobe predominant emphysema and high exercise capacity in the LVRS group showed higher mortality (OR 2.28 (95% CI 1.12 to 4.64), 257 participants) compared to the control group at the end of the follow-up.For the remaining categories, upper lobe with high exercise capacity and non-upper lobe with low exercise capacity did not show a significant difference in mortality between LVRS and control, OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.46), 419 participants and OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.47), 149 participants. Follow-up after 4.3 years showed that the benefit of LVRS on mortality remains for the participants with upper lobe-predominant emphysema with low exercise capacity (RR = 0.57, P = 0.01). There were no differences in mortality at the end of the follow-up for the two other groups sub-groups (Upper lobe and high exercise capacity, and Non-upper lobe and low exercise capacity)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disease specific quality of life in subgroups:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please consider revising the couple sentences below; it currently seems to suggest that non high-risk patients have an improvement in HRQOL while high-risk patients do not. However, the CIs of the lower risk group fall entirely within the higher risk group (which is an extremely imprecise result) and the test for subgroup difference does not give any evidence to suggest we can say one group benefits while the other does not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Analysis of the subgroups stratified by risk showed no difference in health-related Quality of Life improvement between the surgical and control group for the high risk participants, OR 12.01 (95% CI 0.66 to 218.88). However, more non high-risk participants showed a significant improvement in SGRQ compared to the medical group (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.31 to 7.72).&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-JVA: &lt;/b&gt;- rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Summary of findings table:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;This still requires a little more work. The intention of the SOF is that it could be read in isolation to the rest of the review and still give the reader a summary of what was found. Specifically:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please give it a proper title (i.e. the review question/comparison that is featured in the table, rather than 'undefined') &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please expand on the PICO &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please add footnotes to explain your downgrading decisions for all the outcomes rated as 'moderate' &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider whether SGRQ should be downgraded for ROB - all the studies were unblinded so I would suggest SGRQ is subject to both performance and detection bias (as the patient themself is the outcome assessor). There is also an argument that LFTs and exercise capacity are vulnerable to performance bias, although they are likely more objective than SGRQ.&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Agree on SGRQ, downgraded. LFT &amp;amp; 6MWD remains at level.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please revisit the outcomes walking distance, RV and TLC in the SOF - they do not match their respective analyses and I cannot see where the reported statistical results come from. In addition the way the anticipated effects are phrased does not really make sense. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please add the abbreviations used in the SOF table underneath, next to where CI, RR and OR are listed (e.g. FEV1, TLC, RV etc). &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;19th May 2016: Further thoughts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;- I have revised the 'What's new' a little further to try and show what the difference in the conclusions between this and the former review are, please check or edit further. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;JVA: agree&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Under 'Baseline lung function' please include this one study as a reference in this sentence: 'All studies but one reported a variety of lung function measures at baseline'. Also 'Baseline partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PA02) and carbon dioxide (PAC02) were reported by all but two studies.' include the two studies here in brackets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Some Included study references are not in the correct format eg NETT (NETT 2003?), CLVR (Miller 2006?), etc, take a look and consider revising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;- JVA: I stuck to the previous format in which NETT was just referred to as NETT. Changed to fit format. JRT: great&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;RN 2/3/16 editorial check&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a great update - thank you for your hard work. I have read through the review to perform our standard editorial checks. I would suggest tackling Chris Cates' suggesting first (below and in Word document you should have received separately), as they may require some structural changes to the review, which would likely make some of my comments no longer applicable. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with the team if you have any questions about any of the comments made. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's new: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the conclusions have changed somewhat with the longer follow up data included - please consider revising the text in the 'what's new' section (highlighted).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: Done. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;JRT: Checked and edited a little further. I have added '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt; further confirm the already reasonably positive findings of the original review.' but perhaps this could be written differently, some recognition of the difference in the conclusions between this review and the original review would be good, but of course keep it short.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would suggest re-writing under standard headings according to new guidance as per EJ's comments below. Consider also simplifying language where possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: Done. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: Yes, done and JT edited a little further&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing COPD as 'affecting 200-300 million people each year' is slightly confusing; are you talking about a prevalence or an incidence? Please clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: rewritten &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: confirmed change&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assessment of reporting bias:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please review the tense used to explain what you have done, rather than what was planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: Done. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT checked and mostly done, but some further edits added&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subgroup analysis:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appears to start reporting a result (high versus low risk) - stick to stating what the subgroups were rather than a result. Justification for the post-hoc change could be expanded on in the 'differences between protocol and review' section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: Done. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: Change to shorten to just 'High versus low risk patients'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph - I think you mean detection not performance bias (highlighted). There is also some discrepancy between the text in this section (for both performance and detection bias) and Figure 2 - please check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: changed. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: This sentence deleted: &lt;b&gt;'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The two remaining studies had an unclear status. &lt;a href=&quot;https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=821599100113383948&amp;versionPK1=z1603030921203757708743027226644&amp;versionPK2=z1605160111345198382646328972283#STD-McKenna-1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;McKenna 1996&lt;/a&gt;, who compared indicated that the patients were blindly randomized, but not specify anything further. &lt;a href=&quot;https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=821599100113383948&amp;versionPK1=z1603030921203757708743027226644&amp;versionPK2=z1605160111345198382646328972283#STD-Stammberger-2000&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Stammberger 2000&lt;/a&gt; didnot report on blinding of either participants or personnel.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: Other biases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand the highlighted sentence; do you mean people swapping between trial &lt;i&gt;arms&lt;/i&gt;? Please revise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;b&gt; JvA: done &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: changed to read '...&lt;/i&gt; medical group were allowed to cross-over to the treatment group after the follow-up period in the control group was completed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effects of the intervention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've changed the numbering of the analyses as they did not seem to match your forest plots - please check this is correct. I noticed that analysis 1.17 doesn't seem to be reported in the text - should it be discussed in the 'hospital utilisation' section? I've also introduced some subheadings into the mortality section to try to make it clearer which follow-up point is being described. In the Quality of Life section it is not very clear what the reported percentages are referring to - could you please revise this sentence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-JVA: numbering corrected, analysis 1.7 included in hospital utilization section. Subheadings are very appreciated. Thanks. QoL section is rewritten.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;JRT: Sign-off Editor/CJC as Statistician to check happy with this change. QoL changes noted also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the summary of main findings section might benefit from a couple sentences that bring together the main findings of the review, before going on to a detailed discussion of the mortality findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-JVA: added. The discussion has been slightly altered since the previous version to reflect the changes as a result of the new outcomes (see Chris Cates section) and some recent discussion we have had in the team.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;JRT: Sign-off Editor to check happy with this change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be great if a SoF table could be included and GRADE assessments made. This could then be incorporated into the 'quality of evidence' section of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-JVA: added &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: SoF Added, CJC to check looks OK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Differences between review and protocol:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could include a comment explaining that methods have been updated to bring review into line with current Cochrane best practice methods (e.g. inclusion of a SoF table and GRADE assessments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-JvA: added &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: change noted&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forest plots:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please double check the forest plots to ensure the 'totals' are turned off where appropriate, to avoid double counting of the same participants (e.g. I turned them off for analysis 1.6 - SGRQ stratified by follow up)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;JvA: Done. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characteristics of included studies table:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please include a note about the funding source (if known) for each included trial in the 'notes' section of the characteristics of included studies tables. I have added the missing abbreviations to the footnotes of the tables - please check they are correct and I haven't missed anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- JvA: funding added for NETT. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General comment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the word 'condition' is used throughout the review to mean the intervention received (e.g. &amp;quot;with no difference in FEV1 at 6 and 12 months follow-up between the two `conditions&amp;quot;). I don't think this use of the word is quite correct and will not make sense to most readers. Perhaps consider using 'trial arms' or 'groups' instead (which you do already in some places).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;b&gt;JvA: changed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt;JRT: This has been changed several places in the review.

The findings from the large study indicated that in patients who survive up to three months post-surgery, there were significantly better health status and lung function outcomes in favour of surgery compared with usual medical care. Patients identified post hoc as being of high risk of death from surgery were those with particularly impaired lung function and poor diffusing capacity and/or homogenous emphysema. Further research should address the effect of this intervention on exacerbations and rate of decline in lung function and health status.&lt;br&gt;This can be submitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=======================================&lt;br&gt;CJC editing July 19 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: Well written summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: checked by Liz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Good but I cannot tell which studies included Pulmonary Rehab in both arms and which studies used Rehab in the non-surgical arm as a comparator. Could you make this clearer please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Please harmonise labels so that they are the same for all outcomes (treatment, surgery and LRVS all used at present and contro, MT and medical therapy). Directions seem fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis : Do not understand final sentence - are you referring to Pulmonary rehab not being given to surgical patients in some trials? Please clarify. I have altered the synopsis to make clear that mortality was not different (as other outcomes remain better following surgery).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract : &amp;quot; The benefits of surgery in those who survive appear great, but this observation should be tempered by the possible placebo effect of surgery, which studies have not been able to control for adequately.&amp;quot; To me this is not the main issue with this review. QOL is higher with surgery but there is a substantial increase in mortality especially early on and in high risk patients. I have therefore amended this sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Could study durations be reported explicitly in Description of Studies please. It matters for the baseline mortality rates described later. Looks at if NETT is 3 years? Could you comment on the clinical importance of the change in QOL scores (these are well above the minimum clinical difference I think)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***There is a problem using Peto OR for this data as the NETT study shows a large effect and Peto is known to underestimate large effects. Please change to OR in Metaview defaults and Table 4 needs to be redone. I have adjusted the mortality and NNT pictures to use OR but may have missed Peto if it is anywhere else.*****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;The lack of blinding fails to control adequately for the possible placebo effect of surgery, and this may account for the significant differences in quality of life markers, irrespective of whether the studies undertook intention to treat and last observation carried forward analyses, or whether they report censored data.&amp;quot; I have altered this sentence as I think it is pretty unlikely that the difference is a placebo effect in view of the long duration and the objective changes in lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked -done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action p-Toby this is an excellent update. Please tidy up Metaview labels and change defaults to OR not Peto. Also Table 4 needs OR to be reported (very similar to Peto in this case as no big Rx effect in final mortality). Then this can go for Peer Review if authors are happy with the amended version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Old title: Lung volume reductionsurgery for diffuse emphysema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes from TJL:&lt;br&gt;I have gone through the search results from all years and updated the review to include a total of 8 trials. NETT is obviously the most influential study due to its size and analysis of endpoints (including post-operative morbidity and mortality).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NNTs - this is a thorny issue for me as there are some very different answers according to which method we use to pool the data and how we subsequently calculate the NNT. There are (relatively) low rates of mortality in the control groups.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-12 15:48:53 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="LVR-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does lung volume reduction surgery improve lung function and quality of life, without leading to an increased chance of death, higher rates of illness after the procedure and higher costs for patients with severe emphysema, and which surgical methods lead to the best results in these patients?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Emphysema causes severe damage to the lungs, which leads to breathing problems. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) may help improve symptoms by removing the most diseased and non-functioning parts of the lung. However, this procedure has been the centre of much controversy with its possible benefit being outweighed by potential harms and costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review examined the research published up to the 14th of April, 2016, and identified 11 studies involving 1760 participants. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared a traditional approach to LVRS with a 'non-resectional' surgical approach. All participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review found that people undergoing LVRS were at increased risk of death at three months after the procedure. By the end of follow-up, death rates were lower for participants treated with LVRS than for those given standard medical care. Participants who were characterised by poor lung function with a particular distribution of diseased tissue in their lungs were at higher risk of death at three months and throughout one large study. One study identified a group of participants who responded better to LVRS than other participants, making them especially suitable for this treatment. The benefit of surgery for surviving participants was significant in terms of quality of life, exercise capacity and lung function, but costs of the procedure are relatively high, and patients had a greater chance of adverse events after the procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the data reported is low to moderate in nature owing to some methodological issues of the trials (lack of blinding, unclear risk of bias). The results presented in this review are largely dominated by one influential study, which accounted for 68% of the participants.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-30 12:51:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) performed to treat patients with severe diffuse emphysema was reintroduced in the nineties. Lung volume reduction surgery aims to resect damaged emphysematous lung tissue, thereby increasing elastic properties of the lung. This treatment is hypothesised to improve long-term daily functioning and quality of life, although it may be costly and may be associated with risks of morbidity and mortality. Ten years have passed since the last version of this review was prepared, prompting us to perform an update.</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to gather all available evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) versus non-surgical standard therapy in improving health outcomes for patients with severe diffuse emphysema. Secondary objectives included determining which subgroup of patients benefit from LVRS and for which patients LVRS is contraindicated, to establish the postoperative complications of LVRS and its morbidity and mortality, to determine which surgical approaches for LVRS are most effective and to calculate the cost-effectiveness of LVRS.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-06 22:29:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified two new studies (89 participants) in this updated review. A total of 11 studies (1760 participants) met the entry criteria of the review, one of which accounted for 68% of recruited participants. The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate owing to an unclear risk of bias across many studies, lack of blinding and low participant numbers for some outcomes. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared traditional 'resectional' LVRS with a non-resectional surgical approach. Participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. Short-term mortality was higher for LVRS (odds ratio (OR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.22 to 11.79; 1489 participants; five studies; moderate-quality evidence) than for control, but long-term mortality favoured LVRS (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95; 1280 participants; two studies; moderate-quality evidence). Participants identified post hoc as being at high risk of death from surgery were those with particularly impaired lung function, poor diffusing capacity and/or homogenous emphysema. Participants with upper lobe-predominant emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity showed the most favourable outcomes related to mortality, as investigators reported no significant differences in early mortality between participants treated with LVRS and those in the control group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.29; 290 participants; one study), as well as significantly lower mortality at the end of follow-up for LVRS compared with control (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78; 290 participants; one study). Trials in this review furthermore provided evidence of low to moderate quality showing that improvements in lung function parameters other than forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), quality of life and exercise capacity were more likely with LVRS than with usual follow-up. Adverse events were more common with LVRS than with control, specifically the occurrence of (persistent) air leaks, pulmonary morbidity (e.g. pneumonia) and cardiovascular morbidity. Although LVRS leads to an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the procedure is relatively costly overall.</P>

<P>Lung volume reduction surgery, an effective treatment for selected patients with severe emphysema, may lead to better health status and lung function outcomes, specifically for patients who have upper lobe-predominant emphysema with low exercise capacity, but the procedure is associated with risks of early mortality and adverse events.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-09 05:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the leading causes of mortality in the world (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2012</LINK>), is a heterogeneous group of diseases that show similar symptoms and include contrasting and overlapping underlying disease processes (<LINK REF="REF-Stockley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockley 2009</LINK>). Most patients with COPD are given a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, chronic inflammation of the central airways, emphysema or impaired and damaged lung parenchyma epithelium; most commonly, they show symptoms relating to both chronic bronchitis and emphysema (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuder 2003</LINK>). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a chronic progressive disease that is largely preventable and is characterised by hyperinflation and decreased elasticity of the airways resulting from structural degradation and inflammation of lung tissue; in patients with COPD, efficient gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood is impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Bourdin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourdin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharafkhaneh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharafkhaneh 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with severe emphysema have limited treatment options as a result of extensive damage to the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russi 1997</LINK>). One available treatment is lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), in which unhealthy damaged parts of the lung are resected, leading to improved mechanical efficiency of healthy parts of the lung, and subsequently more efficient gas exchange. However, LVRS is a complicated procedure with significant associated risks. This review set out to determine the effectiveness of LVRS, to define the mortality and morbidity related to LVRS and to identify optimal surgical techniques.</P>
<P>This review is an update of previous Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hensley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tiong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiong 2006</LINK>), which identified several studies, including the very large <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> trial. A considerable amount of time has passed since the last version of the review, prompting us to revisit literature published since that time. The current review focuses only on surgical lung volume reduction; lung volume reduction through endoscopic/bronchoscopic procedures will be addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-van-Agteren-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Agteren 2016</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-06 07:03:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Emphysema, one of the main conditions of COPD, is characterised by destruction of the extracellular matrix in the walls of the smaller airways and the lung parenchyma (<LINK REF="REF-Sharafkhaneh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharafkhaneh 2008</LINK>). Emphysema can be defined by disease distribution, as well as location. An emphysematous lung can show a homogenous or heterogeneous (regional) pattern of pathological lesions, which can impact lung parameters characteristic of emphysema differently (e.g. dynamic lung volume) (<LINK REF="REF-Boutou-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutou 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mair-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mair 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Weder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weder 1997</LINK> developed a more specific classification of emphysema that divides patients into three classes: markedly heterogeneous, intermediately heterogeneous and homogenous. Furthermore, emphysema can be divided into subtypes based on the unit of lung anatomy in which the emphysema is predominantly present (<LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2002</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Centrilobular emphysema:</B> most closely associated with smoking and results from dilation and destruction of respiratory bronchioles. Lesions associated with centrilobular emphysema are located predominantly in the upper lung.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Panlobular emphysema: </B>found mainly in the lower lobes and often associated with a genetic (alpha<SUB>1</SUB>-anti-trypsin) deficiency.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Paraseptal emphysema: </B>occurs in the periphery of the lobules, specifically in the subpleural region.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Emphysema, which develops as the result of an interplay of various processes, is fuelled predominantly by exposure to cigarette smoke or other noxious particles (e.g. air pollutants) (<LINK REF="REF-Stockley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockley 2009</LINK>). Constant exposure to noxious particles leads to oxidative stress, a proteinase-antiproteinase imbalance, increased apoptosis and chronic inflammation, all leading to gradual destruction of the lung tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Bagdonas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagdonas 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Demedts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demedts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkham-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkham 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suki 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taraseviciene_x002d_Stewart-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taraseviciene-Stewart 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The consistent destruction of healthy lung tissue results in the classic physiological characteristics of severe emphysema: hyperinflation of lungs, loss of elastic recoil, loss of surface area for gas exchange and flow limitation (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingenito-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingenito 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papandrinopoulou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papandrinopoulou 2012</LINK>). Emphysema causes a decrease in elastic recoil pressure and an increase in lung compliance. This in turn causes static and dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs, which limits airflow and results in clinical outcomes of lower functional capacity, higher levels of dyspnoea and limited exercise performance. Respiratory symptoms can worsen drastically, leading to physiological deterioration. These respiratory exacerbations can be triggered by a variety of factors and become more frequent in patients with severe emphysema (<LINK REF="REF-Wedzicha-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedzicha 2003</LINK>). Patients with emphysema often have to deal with a significant number of concurrent diseases, including (lung) cancer, cardiovascular disease, anxiety, depression, hypertension and chronic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2014</LINK>), which further significantly affect patient quality of life (QoL) and disease manifestations.</P>
<P>Severe emphysema is diffuse by nature, meaning that emphysematous lesions can be found throughout the lung and are not localised. The focus of this review will be confined to diffuse emphysema. Giant bullous emphysema, which is a separate entity pathologically and radiologically (<LINK REF="REF-Mura-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mura 2005</LINK>), is treated by a different surgical procedure known as bullectomy; therefore we will exclude this condition from the current review.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-09 05:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lung volume reduction surgery was resurrected by Joel Cooper and his colleagues at the Washington University School of Medicine in the 1990s as treatment for patients with advanced COPD in which emphysema is the predominant feature (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1995</LINK>). Three main surgical access techniques may be used for LVRS: median sternotomy, the technique used by Cooper; the less invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS); and thoracotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Russi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russi 1997</LINK>). A detailed description of these surgical procedures can be found in <LINK REF="REF-Fessler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fessler 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Median sternotomy allows access to the pleural space by creating a vertical inline incision across the sternum. The incision is made just below the sternal notch and extends to the tip of the xyphoid process; then a sternal saw is used to split the sternum. The surgeon will usually proceed to operate on the worst affected lung, as determined by preoperative imaging, through resection of unhealthy lung tissue and use of unilateral or bilateral stapling to close the open lung tissue. Cooper suggested that staple lines should be secured with bovine reinforcement strips to prevent air leakage - one of the most frequent complications in pulmonary resection. Furthermore, a pleural tent can be used (<LINK REF="REF-Venuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venuta 1998</LINK>) to ensure that no air leakage occurs.</P>
<P>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, a less invasive form of surgery than median sternotomy (MS), was initially used for simple diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 2000</LINK>). Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery allows the surgeon to gain access to all parts of the lung via placement of trocars and completion of a procedure that requires only small incisions to be made. Trocars are generally placed between the seventh and eighth intercostal spaces and between the fourth and fifth intercostal spaces to allow access to the camera and the surgical instruments, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1995</LINK>). Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery allows, in addition to stapling, the use of newer techniques to shrink lung volume. Specifically, thermal energy can be applied to facilitate reduction via the use of a neodymium: yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd: YAG) laser (<LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unilateral or bilateral thoracotomy is performed to a lesser extent than the surgical approaches already described (<LINK REF="REF-Klepetko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klepetko 1999</LINK>). Thoracotomy incisions are often made in the fourth intercostal space for upper lobe and in the fifth or sixth intercostal space for lower lobe emphysema, and provide especially good access to the lower lobes.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Yusen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusen 1996</LINK>, in line with <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1995</LINK>, proposed that removal of diseased and functionless lung may improve the function of the remaining lung by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>increasing elastic recoil pressure, thereby increasing expiratory airflow;</LI>
<LI>decreasing the degree of hyperinflation, resulting in improved diaphragm and chest wall mechanics; and</LI>
<LI>decreasing the inhomogeneity of regional ventilation and perfusion, leading to improved alveolar gas exchange and increased effectiveness of ventilation in maintaining blood gas levels.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Zoumot-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoumot 2015</LINK> adds that lung volume reduction can result in decreased asynchronous movement of different chest wall compartments, leading to improved ventilatory mechanics. The overall result of the procedure is improvement of the 'fit' of the lung in relation to the chest wall (<LINK REF="REF-Fessler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fessler 1998</LINK>). This notion has been supported by studies examining respiratory mechanics after LVRS (<LINK REF="REF-Degano-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degano 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamneg_x00e5_rd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamnegrd 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teschler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teschler 1996</LINK>). As the main aim of LVRS is improvement of respiratory mechanics, substantial improvement can still be expected in carefully selected patients with homogenous emphysema despite the fact that LVRS traditionally is not recommended for these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Weder-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weder 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>The burden of chronic illness is rising (<LINK REF="REF-Halbert-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halbert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannino-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannino 2007</LINK>), with COPD currently the third leading cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2012</LINK>). Healthcare costs related to COPD in general rise with disease severity, specifically owing to (exacerbation-related) hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-Dal-Negro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dal Negro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perera-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perera 2012</LINK>). Lung volume reduction surgery might significantly benefit patients in the short and long term through improvements in exercise capability, dyspnoea, QoL and survival time (<LINK REF="REF-Teschler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teschler 1999</LINK>). This will lead to an overall increase in the capability of disease management for patients who undergo LVRS. Finding effective treatments to help patients with severe emphysema to manage their illness, thereby preventing them from coming to hospital, can have a tremendously positive impact on the healthcare system and the lives of individual patients.</P>

Stratifying mortality for high risk versus non-high risk shows a significant difference in mortality at completion of follow-up (24 months) for the high risk subgroup (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.92) and no differences in mortality for the non-high risk subgroup (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.14; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> furthermore reported on 90-day mortality for the risk subgroups, showing that the high risk subgroup of participants (N = 140), as well as the non-high risk group, had considerably higher 90-day mortality than participants in the control group (OR 57.24, 95% CI 3.38 to 968.54; and OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.09, respectively).

<LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> post hoc defined subgroups for non-high risk participants on the basis of specific participant characteristics that could influence the efficacy of LVRS: presence of upper or non-upper lobe-predominant emphysema and/or low or high postrehabilitation exercise capacity. Participants with upper lobe-predominant emphysema with a low exercise capacity at baseline in the LVRS group had lower mortality than those in the medical group (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78; 290 participants). Participants with non-upper lobe-predominant emphysema and low exercise capacity in the LVRS group had higher mortality at the end of follow-up (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.64; 257 participants) than those in the control group. For the remaining categories, upper lobe with high exercise capacity and non-upper lobe with high exercise capacity did not show significant differences in mortality between LVRS and control groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.46; 419 participants; and OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.47; 149 participants).

<P>Studies including SGRQ, SF-36, CRQ and QWB used a variety of health status measurements focused on disease-specific quality of life. Censored mean changes in SGRQ from <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> were drawn from surviving participants. We pooled this information with ITT data from the much smaller <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK> study, noting a difference in mean change from baseline in total SGRQ scores at end of follow-up (-13.78 SGRQ units, 95% CI -15.75 to -11.80; 1324 participants; moderate-quality evidence) significantly favoured LVRS over standard medical care (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK> reported that baseline SGRQ scores were inversely related to changes in the domains of SGRG (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that participants with the lowest QoL scores at baseline showed greatest improvement at the end of follow-up. Data from <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK> were also pooled for six- and 12-month follow-up for total scores on SGRQ, indicating favourable QoL scores for LVRS at six months (mean difference (MD) -13.48, 95% CI -15.13 to -11.84) and at 12 months (MD -13.77, 95% CI -15.75 to -11.80).</P>
<P>As a countermeasure to the potential overestimation of effect mediated as a continuous variable, <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> reported long-term follow-up data on the number of participants with an increase, no change or a decrease in their quality of life, describing those who had died or whose data were missing as unchanged/deteriorated.

However, significantly more non-high risk participants showed clinically significant improvement on SGRQ compared with those in the medical group (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.31 to 7.72). The number of responders reporting quality of life from subgroups based on emphysema location and exercise capacity favoured the LVRS group over the medical care control group in all but one category (non-upper lobe with high exercise capacity - no difference; OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.81).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-09 04:57:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review identified two new studies and found extra citations for two previously included studies, leading to changes to the conclusions of this review. Short-term mortality was overall higher for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) than for control, but long-term mortality favoured LVRS. Participants identified post hoc as having high risk of early death from surgery were those with particularly impaired lung function and poor diffusing capacity and/or homogenous emphysema, but these participants did not show higher mortality at the end of follow-up (i.e. initial higher mortality was offset by later lower mortality). Participants with upper lobe-predominant emphysema and low exercise capacity benefited the most from LVRS, as they showed no increased short-term mortality and more favourable long-term mortality. Improvements in lung function, quality of life and exercise capacity were more likely with LVRS than with usual follow-up. Although LVRS leads to an overall increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the procedure is relatively costly overall.</P>
<P>The findings in terms of mortality in the identified subgroups merit consideration, as statistical significance for any one of them may be a function of the numerous categorisations (six in total) of study participants, rather than reflecting a true difference predicted by participant disposition. These subgroups furthermore were tested in only one trial, although the <LINK REF="STD-Geddes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geddes 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK> trials revised entry criteria similarly to the high risk subgroup identified in <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> after determining higher risk of early mortality. It is unlikely that additional studies of similar statistical power to <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> will be conducted, making it difficult to confirm that these are valid distinctions to make in deciding which patients stand to gain the most benefit, and which are at greatest risk of postoperative death.</P>
<P>Additional outcomes of clinical importance, including quality of life, exercise capacity and lung function, overall favoured LVRS. Statistically significant differences in quality of life scores favouring LVRS at the end of follow-up indicated that improvements persisted over a long time. The decrease of 13.6 units for <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> and 14.7 for <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK> on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is clearly in excess of the minimum clinically important difference (a reduction of 4 points) for this questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welling-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welling 2015</LINK>). The censored nature of available continuous outcome data means however that the observed difference in favour of surgically treated patients may overestimate the true effect. Dichotomised data from <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> incorporated data from all randomised participants, indicating that participants treated by LVRS were more likely to experience clinically important improvements in SGRQ scores, exercise capacity and lung function than those treated with usual medical care. Although differences for these endpoints favoured surgery throughout the study, the number of participants with improvements in these variables in the LVRS groups was reduced over time as a result of death and/or withdrawal. Given the progressive nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the decline in health status and lung function and the poor survival observed in long-term pharmacotherapy studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bale-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bale 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2000</LINK>), this could imply that surgery mitigates deterioration in the health of these patients in the long run.</P>
<P>Current information on exacerbations and hospitalisations is available via resource utilisation as a measurement of the cost of treatment in <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>. These data suggest no difference in the mean number of emergency visits between groups at 12, 24 and 36 months. Optimised medical therapy administered to both LVRS and control groups during study monitoring may have reduced the potential for LVRS to modify this endpoint. Furthermore, the number of exacerbations and time until first exacerbation are reduced after LVRS. Cost analysis undertaken in <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> indicates that LVRS was associated with high costs at 12 months of follow-up (by an average of around 45,000 USD for both direct (insurer related) and total (pertaining to <I>all</I> costs including those of carers and individuals undergoing treatment) medical costs). By three years, the total costs of LVRS were significantly higher than those incurred by participants given medical therapy. Calculation of QALYs in <LINK REF="STD-CLVR-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CLVR 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> revealed that LVRS is a relatively costly procedure, as the procedure costs more than the standard $100.000 dollars per QALY gained threshold at end of follow-up. Projections up to 10 years however paint a more favourable cost benefit, with projections as low as $54,000 USD for the overall population and $48,000 USD for the group of high responders. Given that costs should be weighed against benefit and harm, the judgement of whether this intervention is indeed cost-effective should be made against two considerations: first, that the effects of surgery may be overestimated because of the absence of a placebo arm in these studies; and conversely, that favourable effects sustained throughout the study could be expected to have outlasted a placebo effect.</P>
<P>The relative merits of two of the most commonly employed surgical techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and median sternotomy (MS)) have been assessed as a randomised comparison within one of the studies. In most trials, the decision to perform one technique over the other was left to the discretion of the attending surgeon. In a small substudy (N = 148), randomisation between MS and VATS occurred at a small number of the study centres in <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>. These findings indicate that air leak and 30 day mortality rates were similar between the two randomised groups (P = 0.08 and 0.39, respectively). Although investigators noted no significant differences between groups in terms of within-hospital costs, they reported a significant difference in total medical costs of treatment in favour of VATS. However, this difference represents only a snapshot of the total costs of treatment in this study, and the longer-term costs of surgery appeared to fluctuate in relation to those of usual medical care.</P>
<P>The two studies comparing laser versus stapling (<LINK REF="STD-McKenna-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 1996</LINK>) and buttressing versus use of a non-buttressed staple line (<LINK REF="STD-Stammberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stammberger 2000</LINK>) provide some evidence for the use of specific resection techniques. Using a stapler rather than a neodymium: yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd: YAG) laser led to better quality of life (QoL), less oxygen use after the procedure and better improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>). Butrressing the staple line led to fewer air leaks and shorter air leak duration and drainage time compared with control.</P>
<P>Finally, the <LINK REF="STD-Pompeo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pompeo 2012</LINK> trial added further evidence for the favourable results of traditional LVRS, with favourable results for quality of life, lung function outcomes and exercise capacity, and showed that traditional LVRS was comparable with a unique innovative awake non-resectional method for performing LVRS, without leading to higher risk of death.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-30 13:26:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies recruited highly selected patient populations (on average 29% of the screening population), and this statistic bears testimony to the fact that people with a particular type of emphysema are considered most likely to benefit and therefore are the most operable (<LINK REF="REF-Yusen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zoumot-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoumot 2014</LINK>). This is supported by trials assessing patient eligibility. <LINK REF="REF-Akuthota-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akuthota 2012</LINK> conducted an analysis on a COPD patient database and found that up to 15% of the patient population could be eligible for LVRS on the basis of <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> criteria, highlighting that LVRS is an option only for a subgroup of emphysematous patients.</P>
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation adds an additional layer of selection and introduces an important aspect of presurgical and post surgical management. Benefits of respiratory rehabilitation in COPD include reduced daily functional impairment as measured by health-related quality of life and exercise capacity (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>). Although these effects are consistently superior to 'usual follow-up' in the context of randomised studies, the take-up of LVRS may be hindered in part by the large numbers of patients who do not complete pulmonary rehabilitation following initial referral (<LINK REF="REF-Cockram-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garrod-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrod 2006</LINK>). In the context of LVRS, pulmonary rehabilitation may play an important role in establishing optimal care before a decision is made on whether to proceed with surgery, especially if the outcome of rehabilitation is delay in or even rejection of surgery. Subsequent to the procedure, it may be advantageous that in the phase of postsurgical recovery, a routine of sustained physical activity and self-management is established. The study design for most of the trials in this review incorporated pulmonary rehabilitation programmes in both intervention and control groups; therefore, the significant impact of surgery on exercise capacity at long-term follow-up may reflect a favourable effect of LVRS in improving exercise tolerance. Although the enhanced lifestyle and exercise intervention may have limited the generalisability of review findings, this review, may in fact be an accurate reflection of the rigorous screening procedures recommended in guidance for LVRS (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Limited data from studies comparing the different available surgical techniques may also hinder the provision of clear guidance as to the risks and benefits of particular procedures. <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> provided a non-randomised comparison between VATS and MS, indicating some advantages of VATS over MS; <LINK REF="STD-Stammberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stammberger 2000</LINK> showed that buttressing the staple line has advantages over non-stapling; and <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 1996</LINK> indicated that stapling was superior to laser ablation, but overall the evidence comparing different methods is not strong.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-30 13:26:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is based on a total of 11 trials that have contributed data on a range of clinically relevant endpoints, including postoperative mortality, determination of whether the risk carried by this intervention is sufficient to justify withholding its use and information on well-defined patients who can derive benefit from surgery. Evidence from <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> dominates this review and has largely influenced the wider debate about whether the cost of LVRS is justified in terms of the health benefit the intervention confers weighed against the potential harm it poses to those who opt to undergo the procedure. Although the other trials are substantially smaller, their results further strengthen the evidence provided by <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> and add valuable information on a large number of important endpoints. Specifically, the long-term survival data provided by <LINK REF="STD-CLVR-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CLVR 2005</LINK> strengthen conclusions regarding the mortality risk associated with LVRS.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence provided in this review ranges from low to moderate (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for an overview). We graded data on early and long-term mortality as moderate because of the overall high rates of unclear and high risk of bias, and thus risk of methodological flaws, found in all trials. Specific focus on mortality data for subgroups identified in <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> reveals that the evidence is of low quality because of the small number of participants included in each subgroup.</P>
<P>We rated the quality of evidence provided for quality of life, measured via the SGRQ, as moderate, and the quality of evidence on exercise capacity, specifically measured via the six-minute walking distance (6MWD), as low. We downgraded evidence on quality of life, as the SGRQ is a subjective measure and can thus be subject to performance and detection bias in unblinded trials. We downgraded the quality of evidence for 6MWD as a result of the small participant number (and thus resulting imprecision), and the fact that the 6MWD is effort-dependent. Similarly, we downgraded the quality of evidence for FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, as this is an effort-dependent measure, and only a small participant number was available for this outcome. We rated the quality of evidence for remaining lung function parameters - RV and TLC - as low because meta-analysis of the small participant number was possible for this outcome, and because overall rates of unclear and high risk of bias were high in all trials.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-09-30 13:26:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has several limitations that are important to address. First is the issue of subgroup analysis. Provision of LVRS will likely be limited to those participants who do not fall into the high risk categorisation of the <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>. We were unable to test the validity of this definition across trials because of the absence of stratified data in the remaining trials (although <LINK REF="STD-Geddes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geddes 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK> seemed to report similar findings). Additional work in those who have shown a survival benefit (i.e. those with predominantly upper lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity from <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>) would help to confirm this finding. Studies using eligibility criteria similar to <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>, which have been conducted more recently (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2011</LINK>), however, provide evidence to support the beneficial effects of LVRS for the subgroups identified by NETT.</P>
<P>Second is the issue of censored data. Meta-analysis of variables likely to feature in a clinical setting such as exercise capacity and lung function should ideally reflect the metrics on which they would be measured on a day-to-day basis (i.e. % predicted, L/min, metres). However, the primary data available for <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> are reported as dichotomised endpoints (i.e. the number of participants achieving an increase in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>and exercise capacity). A balance is needed between adequate adjustment for missing data and analysis and reporting of data in a clinically meaningful way.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-30 13:26:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in this review are largely in line with the results of early prospective studies indicating favourable results of LVRS in selected patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ciccone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciccone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotloff--1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kotloff 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pompeo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pompeo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sciurba-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sciurba 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teschler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teschler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 1995</LINK>). None of these studies, however, matched the power and rigorousness obtained in the <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> trial and the other RCTs featured in this review (with the notable exception of the RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Pompeo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pompeo 2000</LINK>, which was excluded from this review, as it included patients with bullous emphysema).</P>
<P>More recent trials have found similar improvements (e.g. functional outcomes), as reported in this review, complemented by improved survival. <LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2011</LINK>, using the entry criteria defined by <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>, found no operative or 90 day mortality and a 0.95 probability of survival at three years. <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2014</LINK> reported on a range of functional outcomes showing clear improvement after both bilateral and unilateral LVRS, and showed no additional mortality in patients treated unilaterally (as opposed to bilaterally, with a 90 day mortality rate of 21.7%).</P>
<P>Other reviews on the topic of LVRS (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pompeo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pompeo 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zahid-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahid 2011</LINK>) have come to the same conclusion as was reached for the specific outcomes measured in this review. <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK> furthermore included the <LINK REF="STD-Moser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moser 2008</LINK> (fibrin sealant vs no sealant) and <LINK REF="STD-Rathinam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rathinam 2009</LINK> (BioGlue vs buttressing of staple line) studies looking at different sealants, and concluded that fibrin sealant reduces air leakage and chest tube drainage duration and that results for BioGlue are comparable with those reported for buttressing of the staple line.</P>

<P>Evidence available to-date indicates that LVRS can lead to improved health outcomes and improvement in disease status (e.g. reduction in frequency of exacerbations) for selected patients with severe emphysema. Specifically, patients must have completed a course of pulmonary rehabilitation and must have had their candidacy for surgery established through high-resolution computed tomography if disease severity and distribution of emphysema are to be determined (<LINK REF="REF-DeCamp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCamp 2008</LINK>). Patient selection ideally involves a multi-disciplinary team consisting of respiratory physicians, radiologists and surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Rathinam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathinam 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK> (supported in part by <LINK REF="STD-Geddes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geddes 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hillerdal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillerdal 2005</LINK>) findings reveal that the subgroups of participants identified as being at high risk of death from surgery are those with particularly impaired lung function and poor diffusing capacity and/or homogeneous emphysema. Evidence furthermore points out that LVRS seems particularly effective for patients with heterogeneous upper lobe-predominant emphysema (and low baseline exercise capacity).</P>
<P>This review has highlighted that lung volume reduction surgery confers risk of early-stage postoperative death, but the degree to which patients are at risk could be predicted by specific characteristics. Guidance on the estimate of differential risk is drawn from a post hoc analysis performed in one large study conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-NETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NETT 2003</LINK>). In this trial, long-term follow-up of the high risk participants suggested that the initial increase in the odds of death did not remain significant and crossed after 4.3 years - a finding further supported by a Canadian trial (<LINK REF="STD-CLVR-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CLVR 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results presented in this review are not new (most trials were completed over 10 years ago), but remaining therapeutic nihilism for this specific set of vulnerable patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zoumot-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoumot 2014</LINK>) is thought to be due to misconceptions about the safety of the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-McNulty-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNulty 2014</LINK>). More recent observational research (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2011</LINK>) suggests that improved patient selection and maturity of procedures performed in highly specialised centres may have led to a substantially lower risk of death over time. This suggestion holds promise that the positive health outcomes of LVRS may be even further improved compared with the results presented in this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-30 13:27:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional work in this area should consider the effects of LVRS on hospitalisation, and the requirement for oral steroid and antibiotic therapy in the management of exacerbations of COPD, and should seek to determine whether LVRS slows this rate of decline in health, as measured by lung function, quality of life and frequency of hospital admission. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see more centres that routinely perform LVRS publish mortality and morbidity data for their patients, in accordance with the example of <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2011</LINK>, preferably via the use of controlled studies, thereby further strengthening the evidence for the potential effectiveness of LVRS in selected patients.</P>
<P>Although the palliative effects of LVRS have been shown, uptake of this procedure is limited because of the costs involved and perceived mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lenfant-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenfant 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNulty-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNulty 2014</LINK>). This fact, among others, has pushed towards the development of techniques that can help to deliver the benefits of LVRS without the risk of death and costs associated with it. Recent advantages in the field of non-surgical bronchoscopic techniques have sparked hope for patients with emphysematous destruction of lung tissue who are unresponsive to medical therapy, do not meet the strict criteria for LVRS or do not wish to undergo surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ingenito-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingenito 2008</LINK>). Non-surgical techniques and interventions used to perform bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) are distinct but aim to achieve the same result: increasing the mechanical efficiency of the lung, thereby improving the health status of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Fessler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fessler 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maxfield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxfield 2004</LINK>). By aiming to achieve similar results as those witnessed in LVRS but without the potential morbidity, mortality and costs involved, these treatments may prove to be a valuable addition to or substitute for LVRS in the treatment of patients with severe emphysema. Several studies have been done or are currently under way on an array of techniques, including one-way valves (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ninane-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninane 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sciurba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciurba 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venuta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venuta 2005</LINK>), endobronchial coils (<LINK REF="REF-Desl_x00e9_e-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desle 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klooster-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klooster 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klooster-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klooster 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zoumot-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoumot 2015</LINK>), airway stents (<LINK REF="REF-Choong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choong 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higuchi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higuchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2011</LINK>), sealants (<LINK REF="REF-Come-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Come 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Criner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criner 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Refaely-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Refaely 2010</LINK>) and vapour ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Herth-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herth 2016</LINK>); these techniques may open up a new frontier in the treatment of patients with severe emphysema. Future research should compare the effectiveness of these new BLVR techniques versus LVRS in the treatment of severe emphysema, as, for instance, is planned for the <LINK REF="STD-CELEB" TYPE="STUDY">CELEB</LINK> study.<BR/>
