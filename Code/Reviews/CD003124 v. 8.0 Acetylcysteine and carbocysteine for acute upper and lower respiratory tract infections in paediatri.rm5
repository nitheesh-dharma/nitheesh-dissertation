<P>In this update, no new trials were identified for inclusion. We excluded one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Varricchio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Varricchio 2008</LINK>). The conclusions about the efficacy of the treatment remain unchanged. However, we found new literature supporting evidence for side effects of carbocysteine and acetylcysteine, which led to the withdrawal of the licence of carbocysteine and acetylcysteine in paediatric patients younger than two years in France in April 2010, and then in Italy. This has been added to the conclusions of this updated review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-23 02:05:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed drugs which aim to change the structure of bronchial secretions. This systematic review assessed their efficacy and safety for treating acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. We also looked in particular at patients younger than two years of age.</P>
<P>Forty-nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were included to study efficacy, and compared acetylcysteine or carbocysteine to placebo. Thirty-four trials (including the previous six) were eligible to study safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients.</P>
<P>The results of this review suggest actual but limited efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) and good overall safety (except for rare mild gastrointestinal side effects) among children older than two years of age. However, the number of participants included was limited and the methodological quality was questionable. These results should also take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). In children younger than two years, and given strong<B> </B>concerns about safety (increased instead of decreased bronchial secretions), these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the context of a randomised controlled trial.</P>

<P>Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed mucolytic drugs in Brazil and many European and African countries.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-23 02:02:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six trials involving 497 participants to study efficacy. They showed some benefit (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) from mucolytic agents, although differences were of little clinical relevance. No conclusion was drawn about the subgroup of infants younger than two years because data were unavailable. Thirty-four studies, including the previous six trials involving 2064 children, were eligible to study safety. Overall safety was good but very few data were available to evaluate safety in infants younger than two years. However, 59 cases of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea observed in infants were reported to the French pharmacovigilance system.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-23 02:01:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results have to be interpreted with caution because they are based on a limited number of participants included in studies whose methodological quality is questionable. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine seem to have a limited efficacy and appear to be safe in children older than two years. These results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). Given strong concerns about safety, these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower RTIs in the context of a RCT with regards to children younger than two years.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-23 02:01:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most frequent infections in children, occurring 7 to 10 times a year in school age children<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2008</LINK>).<B> </B>The main symptom is acute cough. Coughing can last more than 10 days in half of the cases and more than three weeks in about 10% of cases. Coughing can be distressing, especially in very young children and it has a major impact on the child's and other family members' sleep, and can cause parental anxiety<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2008</LINK>).<B> </B>Parents frequently seek drugs (over-the-counter drugs or drugs requiring a medical prescription) to treat their children's cough.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-23 02:01:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the mucolytic drugs available to treat acute upper and lower RTI, the cysteine derivatives (that is, acetylcysteine and carbocysteine) are the most commonly prescribed in many European (<LINK REF="REF-Cano-Garcinu_x00f1_o-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cano Garcinuño 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalumeau-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalumeau 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duijvestijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duijvestijn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 2011</LINK>) and African countries (<LINK REF="REF-Mourdi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mourdi 2010</LINK>) and in Brazil (<LINK REF="REF-Bricks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricks 1996</LINK>). Various systemic (oral, intramuscular or intravenous) or inhaled forms of the drugs are available. In The Netherlands, one-third of general practitioners prescribe acetylcysteine for asthmatic bronchitis, acute bronchitis, or for productive or dry cough (<LINK REF="REF-Duijvestijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duijvestijn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 2011</LINK>). In France, three studies have shown that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are some of the most prescribed drugs for children, especially those younger than two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Chalumeau-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalumeau 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collet-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collet 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horen 2002</LINK>). In one of these studies, cysteine derivatives accounted for 18% to 25% of drug prescriptions for acute rhinopharyngitis, acute cough and acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chalumeau-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalumeau 2000</LINK>).<I> </I>The high rate of prescription of cysteine derivatives for acute upper and lower RTI in paediatric patients was shown to be unchanged in the last decade in France (<LINK REF="REF-Halna-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halna 2005</LINK>)<I>. </I>In Italy, carbocysteine is one of the 20 drugs most prescribed by family paediatricians (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzato-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzato 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 2011</LINK>). In Spain, expectorants are the drugs most prescribed by paediatricians and general practitioners for the treatment of acute bronchitis, and they are the second commonest pharmacological group prescribed to children under two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Cano-Garcinu_x00f1_o-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cano Garcinuño 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanz 1988</LINK>). In Germany, acetylcysteine is in the top five of drugs prescribed to paediatric patients under one year of age (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00fc_cheler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bücheler 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-27 10:10:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In vitro, cysteine derivatives act by breaking disulphide bridges between macromolecules, which leads to a reduction in mucus viscosity (<LINK REF="REF-Medici-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medici 1979</LINK>). This property led physicians in the 1960s and 1970s to develop mucolytic drugs for clinical situations where sputum modification to reduce cough is sought, including cystic fibrosis and chronic and acute bronchitis. In adult patients, the use of cysteine derivatives may cause a small reduction in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2012</LINK>). In paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, there is no evidence of effectiveness of either oral or inhaled administration of acetylcysteine (<LINK REF="REF-Duijvestijn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duijvestijn 1999</LINK>). In addition to being used for patients with severe chronic pulmonary disease, in some countries cysteine derivatives are also widely used to treat previously healthy paediatric patients with acute broncho-pulmonary disease.</P>

<P>Acetylcysteine was tested in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>) with a total of 209 participants. The first study included 59 patients with acute bronchitis or broncho-pulmonary infections and compared oral administration of the antibiotic-mucolytic combination (thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate) (n<SUB>1 </SUB>= 30) with thiamphenicol alone (n<SUB>2 </SUB>= 29) as an active control at the dose of 14 mg/kg/day of acetylcysteine with a duration of treatment of six days (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>). There was total remission of febrile state, dyspnoea, "thoracic semeiologic alterations" (i.e., "wheezing breathing", rattling) and cough in both groups. However, there was a statistically significant more rapid remission in the group treated with the antibiotic-mucolytic combination. For example, there was total remission of febrile state in the treated group after six days, but it took nine days for the recovery of all the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.03).</P>
<P>The second study included patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and compared oral administration of acetylcysteine (n<SUB>1 </SUB>= 25) and placebo (n<SUB>2 </SUB>= 25) at a daily dose of 100 to 300 mg of acetylcysteine, depending on age, for six days (<LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>). All participants received some kind of antibiotic. The clinical parameters returned to normal in a statistically significant shorter time in the acetylcysteine group. For example, by the end of the treatment (six days), the remission of cough was total in the treated group whereas the cough persisted in 16% of the participants in the placebo group (risk difference (RD) -16%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -1%), risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.95).</P>
<P>The third study compared oral acetylcysteine (n<SUB>1 </SUB>= 50) with placebo (n<SUB>2 </SUB>= 50) at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg, subdivided into three daily administrations for 28 days in children with bronchitis or tracheitis (<LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>). Participants received antibiotics if necessary. Clinical improvement was observed in the four groups by the end of the trial. In the subgroup of children with bronchitis, statistically significant differences in the clinical parameters (cough score, cough productivity and thoracic semeiologic alterations) were recorded favourably for the acetylcysteine treatment. For example, the median cough score (range = 0 to 3) decreased faster in the treated group with a difference before/after of 2.1 (2.20 to 0.10), whereas in the placebo group the median score dropped from 2.20 to 0.50 (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>In the subgroup of children with tracheitis, no statistically significant differences were noted on the various clinical parameters, except a statistically significant improvement of the cough score, with a difference before/after of 2.00 (2.10 to 0.10) in the acetylcysteine treatment subgroup and 1.60 (2.10 to 0.50) in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05).

The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) was eight (4 to 34).

At the end of the trial, productive cough was still present in three participants treated with acetylcysteine versus seven patients in the placebo group.

<P>Carbocysteine was tested in three of the six included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Malka-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malka 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>) with a total of 288 participants. The first study included 106 participants with acute bronchitis, and compared oral administration of carbocysteine (n<SUB>1 </SUB>= 49) with placebo (n<SUB>2 </SUB>= 57) at a dose of 200 to 300 mg/day, depending on age, for seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Malka-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malka 1990</LINK>). Both groups received antibiotics if necessary. The clinical symptoms (cough, expectoration, bronchial congestion, dyspnoea) and pulmonary function test abnormalities diminished in both groups. Significant differences between the two groups were observed for expectoration and pulmonary function tests. For example, after four days, expectoration was easier for 69% of the treated participants versus 49% of the participants of the placebo group (RD 23% (1% to 47%)).</P>
<P>The second study included 152 participants with respiratory diseases (bronchial asthma or acute bronchitis) and compared oral administration of carbocysteine (n<SUB>1 </SUB>= 74) with placebo (n<SUB>2 </SUB>= 78) at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day, three to four times daily for seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>). Both groups received bronchodilators, antibiotics and antihistamines if previously treated. The author reported improvement in clinical symptoms in both groups: global impression, cough, stridor, expectoration. The difference in improvement for overall assessment, stridor and expectoration was statistically significant in favour of the treatment group, but the data were available only for the outcome "overall assessment". The analysis of these data showed a RD of 17% (3% to 31%) and a NNTB of six (4 to 32).</P>
<P>The third study included 30 participants with respiratory infections (such as bronchitis) and compared oral administration of carbocysteine (n<SUB>1 </SUB>= 19) with placebo (n<SUB>2 </SUB>= 11) at a dose of 100 to 400 mg/day according to age for five to nine days (<LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>) in participants hospitalised for acute respiratory infections. Participants in both groups received antibiotics if necessary. Improvement of clinical signs (cough, vomiting/dyspnoea, temperature, appetite, general condition) was observed in both groups, with significant improvement for cough, vomiting and dyspnoea in both groups, but the actual improvement of general condition was better in the placebo group. Though not significant, the RD was 12% (-24% to 49%) in favour of the placebo group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.c Pooled analysis</HEADING>
<P>Because we could include very few studies, we have pooled the results of trials involving acetylcysteine and/or carbocysteine. We also considered primary endpoints that were similar but not exactly the same, for example, when the endpoint had close but slightly different dates. As a consequence, we used random-effects models when both acetylcysteine and carbocysteine were involved and/or when the primary endpoints were not exactly the same.</P>
<P>Five major endpoints could be considered for meta-analysis: febrile state after six days (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), cough after six to seven days (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), dyspnoea after six to seven days (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>), thoracic semeiologic alterations after five days (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>) and general condition after six to seven days (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We calculated pooled RDs and when possible, pooled RRs to assess these outcomes. Febrile state after six days and cough after six to seven days were evaluated in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>). The first two studies involved acetylcysteine and the last one, carbocysteine, and the outcome was not considered at exactly the same date (after six days or after an average of six days), so we used a random-effects model. After six days, three participants were still febrile among the participants from the placebo group, whereas none presented fever in the treated group: the pooled RD was -5% (-12% to 2%) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Then, the RR was 0.21 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.77). Regarding cough, after six to seven days of treatment, the risk difference was -10% (-19% to -1%) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and the NNTB was 10 (6 to 101). The RR was 0.37 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.20).</P>
<P>The assessment of the efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine to treat dyspnoea involved an additional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Malka-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malka 1990</LINK>). Six participants treated complained of dyspnoea after six to seven days versus nine in the placebo group. The RD was -3% (-9% to 3%) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) and the RR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.74).</P>
<P>We pooled data from two studies to evaluate the efficacy of acetylcysteine in the treatment of thoracic semeiologic alterations (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>). After three days, no treated participant was presenting that symptom versus three in the placebo group; the RD was 6% (-13% to 2%) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). However, there was heterogeneity between the studies. After using a random-effects model the RD was -5% (-20% to 10%).</P>
<P>We also assessed the efficacy on the general condition using the data from two studies involving carbocysteine (<LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>). After seven days, 24 children were still presenting a deteriorated general condition in the treatment group and 32 in the placebo group. The RD was -7% (-35% to 20%) and the RR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.95).</P>

<P>Our search strategy identified 28 studies to evaluate safety, in addition to the six trials above (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malka-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malka 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>). These 34 studies involved 2064 paediatric participants. Safety was evaluated using clinical, biological, radiographic or pulmonary function test parameters. Among these studies, 17 were controlled trials (including 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)), 16 were non-controlled trials and the last one was a targeted pharmacovigilance study. The studies reporting adverse events were not comparable in terms of participants, interventions or adverse events, and so we judged pooling of the results to be inappropriate.</P>

<P>Nine of these studies were controlled trials in which the treatment was administered orally except in one study for which the route of administration was intramuscular. Control participants received either placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trastotenojo-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trastotenojo 1984</LINK>), an active control treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Baldini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baldini 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camurri-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Camurri 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gusberti-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gusberti 1985</LINK>) or nothing (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1967a" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1967a</LINK>). If a concomitant treatment was authorised, for example, antibiotics, it was authorised for all participants. The controlled trials studied clinical or biological tolerance, or both. The biological tests consisted usually of full blood tests (haemoglobin (Hb), red blood count (RBC), white blood count (WBC) and platelets) and the monitoring of hepatic (bilirubin, serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase) and renal function (creatinine). In two studies, safety was also evaluated using radiographic (<LINK REF="STD-Trastotenojo-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trastotenojo 1984</LINK>) or pulmonary function test parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>). The controlled trials all showed good clinical safety, except mild gastrointestinal tract adverse events (vomiting) in two participants (2%), leading to the withdrawal of one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the other trials, the route of administration was oral in one study, intramuscular in five, inhaled in four, and both oral and intramuscular in one. Most of these studies authorised concomitant treatments, mainly antibiotics. All participants had equal access to these treatments, except in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>). Safety was evaluated using clinical and typically biological tests. Some studies also evaluated safety using radiographic (<LINK REF="STD-Boner-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Boner 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caramia-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Caramia 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loscialpo-Ramundo-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Loscialpo Ramundo 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayaud-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mayaud 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santangelo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Santangelo 1985</LINK>) or pulmonary function test parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Dano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Dano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leupold-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Leupold 1970</LINK>). In one study, the tolerance was not documented (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolic-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolic 1980</LINK>). The main potential adverse event observed was broncho-constriction induced by inhaled N-acetylcysteine in children older than two years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Dano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Dano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leupold-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Leupold 1970</LINK>). As a consequence, 11 children (31%) were withdrawn from one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Leupold-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Leupold 1970</LINK>). This side effect was mainly explained by the trial authors by the high concentration (20%) of acetylcysteine. Whereas in another study, no such effect was reported with a lower concentration (10%) (<LINK REF="STD-Loscialpo-Ramundo-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Loscialpo Ramundo 1968</LINK>). In the other uncontrolled trials clinical safety was very good except in one study where 12 participants (11%) complained of gastro-intestinal tract disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), but none were withdrawn (<LINK REF="STD-Mayaud-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mayaud 1980</LINK>).</P>

If a concomitant treatment was authorised, for example, antibiotics, it was authorised for all participants. The controlled trials used clinical and sometimes biological parameters to evaluate safety. The biological tests consisted of blood tests and/or the monitoring of hepatic and renal function. In two studies, safety was also evaluated using pulmonary function test parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Malka-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malka 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>).

In one of these two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Careddu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Careddu 1989</LINK>) the dose used was high (900 mg/day for children weighing around 25 kg).</P>
<P>The other studies involved 501 paediatric participants.

Biological parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Ginocchi-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ginocchi 1978</LINK>) and sputum viscosimetry (<LINK REF="STD-Castello-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Castello 1979</LINK>) were also used in two trials.

Participants received carbocysteine for six days at a dose of 200 mg per day via the oral route. No concomitant treatment was allowed, except antibiotics in one child. The safety was evaluated clinically by questioning parents and children. The only potentially adverse event reported (vomiting) occurred after the end of the treatment and involved only the child on antibiotics.</P>

<P>Our search strategy also identified a targeted pharmacovigilance study (<LINK REF="STD-Chalumeau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chalumeau 2002</LINK>). This study followed the spontaneous reporting to the French pharmacovigilance system of cases of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea in infants receiving mucolytic agents. This prospective two-month study was performed in the emergency departments of two paediatric teaching hospitals in Paris, France. During this period, six participants were diagnosed as having a paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea after having received acetylcysteine (n = 3) or carbocysteine (n = 3) for acute upper and lower respiratory infections. Participants were aged 2.5 to 7.5 months old. The median delay between treatment and the diagnosis of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea was 4.5 days. The dose was on average 26 mg/kg/day, ranging from 20 to 35 mg/kg/day. Two children were hospitalised because of their respiratory state. Using the Naranjo scale for causality assessment, the causality between the exposure and the adverse reaction was considered possible or plausible (<LINK REF="REF-Naranjo-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naranjo 1981</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-23 02:23:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found a limited number of studies that evaluated the efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine as symptomatic treatments for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in paediatric patients without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biscatti-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Biscatti 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiocchi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fiocchi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malka-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malka 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanini-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Zanini 1974</LINK>). These trials showed some benefit from mucolytic agents, although differences were sometimes small, not statistically significant and/or of little clinical relevance. Considering the pooling of data, the effect of acetylcysteine or carbocysteine was not statistically significant except for cough after six to seven days. The treatment (acetylcysteine or carbocysteine) reduced the risk of cough by 63%. However, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) was 10 with a large CI (6 to 101), suggesting a questionable effect size. Only one of the six trials was considered to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). However, in the low risk of bias trial by<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1977</LINK>, an overall criterion based on an improvement in global condition was used as an outcome, but this composite criterion has not been validated and may not be clinically relevant. No statistically significant difference was observed regarding most symptoms considered separately, especially expectoration and cough. It was not possible to make any evaluation about the subgroup of infants under two years of age, because none of the six studies that we included to evaluate efficacy mentioned the results for this age group separately.</P>
<P>The overall safety of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine was good, with mainly minor gastrointestinal tract disorders in few participants (n = 46; 2%). These findings should not lead to the conclusion that mucolytic agents are well tolerated in paediatric patients. In fact, (i) the size of the low risk of bias trial<I> </I>was not sufficient to provide enough statistical power to detect any rare potentially severe adverse event, (ii) many high risk of bias<B> </B>trials did not provide detailed descriptions of the severity of adverse events and abnormal laboratory tests or reasons for treatment discontinuation separately for each intervention group, and (iii) very few children under two years of age were involved in the studies. RCTs of adequate sample size offer the only unbiased approach for assessing the frequency and severity of side effects from a given medication, but when that kind of evidence is lacking, other sources, such as pharmacovigilance and pharmaco-epidemiology can be helpful.</P>
<P>Regarding the safety of mucolytic agents in paediatric patients, attention should be paid to the youngest age group. In a targeted prospective pharmacovigilance study in two paediatric emergency departments, six infants (all younger than eight months old) were diagnosed with paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea during a two-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Chalumeau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chalumeau 2002</LINK>). An analysis of the French pharmacovigilance system concerning adverse drug reactions to acetylcysteine and carbocysteine showed 59 respiratory adverse drug reactions in children younger than six years from 1989 to 2008 (30 children received carbocysteine, 28 received acetylcysteine and one child received both drugs at the same time). The respiratory adverse drug reactions reported were increased and/or prolonged cough, increased bronchorrhoea, worsening of respiratory distress, mucous vomiting and dyspnoea<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Mallet-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mallet 2011</LINK>). Fifty-one children (86%) required hospitalisation or extended hospitalisation because of the adverse drug reactions. Outcome was favourable in all cases except for one patient in whom pleuropneumonia developed and a one-year-old girl who died of pulmonary oedema that was considered secondary to mucous vomiting according to the reporting physician. These side effects led to the withdrawal of the licence for carbocysteine and acetylcysteine in paediatric patients younger than two years of age in France and Italy in April 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Mourdi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mourdi 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This paradoxical reaction was also mentioned but not documented with references in some articles (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jean 1982</LINK>) and textbooks (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2000b</LINK>). The paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea could be explained by the effective action of mucolytic agents which increase bronchial mucous flow. This flow may exceed the capacity of spontaneous drainage of the infant which is limited by the small bronchial diameter and neuromuscular physiologic immaturity (<LINK REF="REF-Wohl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wohl 1998</LINK>). This could also be explained by a dose-related effect. No dose-response trial has ever been performed for acetylcysteine, leading to a unique dose recommendation of 200 mg per day, whatever the weight of the child. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>), the median weight of a one-month-old infant is about 4.5 kg as opposed to 12.2 kg for a two-year-old. The recommended dose for the youngest infants is then three times higher than the dose recommended for the oldest (about 45 mg/kg/day versus 16 mg/kg/day). This may lead to dose-related adverse events in very young infants. In the same way, no clinical research has been implemented to support the recommended dose of the marketing authorisation of carbocysteine (200 to 300 mg/day). The evaluation of drug safety should depend on age, considering that pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in paediatric patients differ greatly from adults, especially in neonates and infants. Paradoxical side effects are not rare in these age groups (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1994</LINK>) but a causal relationship is difficult to prove when a paradoxical side effect of a drug is suspected because of protopathic bias. The term <I>protopathic bias</I> is used if the first symptoms of the outcome of interest are the reasons for use of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Salas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salas 1999</LINK>).<I> </I>This bias leads people to believe that when symptoms worsen during the course of a drug that is prescribed for a specific disease it may be related to the disease itself and not to the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado_x002d_Rodriguez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado-Rodriguez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horwitz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horwitz 1980</LINK>). The only way to evaluate paradoxical side effects of drugs avoiding protopathic bias would be theoretically to study them in another unrelated disease. However, this is not possible in the case of carbocysteine because its only indications are RTIs. For acetylcysteine, in a multicentre, post-marketing safety study, respiratory symptoms were reported in 2.2% of paediatric (n = 1905) patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose between 1980 and 2005. Respiratory symptoms included bronchospasm, cough, wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath, chest tightness or respiratory distress (<LINK REF="REF-Cumberland-Pharmaceuticals--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumberland Pharmaceuticals 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>The external validity of this review is difficult to evaluate. On the one hand, it seems high given the various settings of the studies, the various types of participants, the various type of interventions and outcomes. On the other hand, the meaning of results observed in studies performed 40 years ago in patients with clinical conditions and general management that are very different from the current practices is questionable.</P>
<P>The evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio of mucolytic agents should take into consideration the fact that these medicines are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). For example, in the <LINK REF="STD-Bellomo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bellomo 1972</LINK> study, remission for all symptoms was complete in the placebo group within nine days at most. Regarding paediatric patients older than two years, no serious adverse events were reported in the available studies included in the present review. These studies suggest that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine may reduce frequency, intensity and duration of symptoms in acute upper and lower RTIs. For the patient group younger than two years, the benefit-risk ratio is most probably negative according to available evidence for side effects in this age group.</P>
<P>Our review has some implications for drug regulation agencies. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are licensed for use for the treatment of acute upper and lower RTIs in paediatric patients in many European countries. According to our review, this license is not supported by strong evidence in children older than two years of age and is not supported by any evidence in children under two years of age, considering some important concerns about safety (<LINK REF="REF-Mallet-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mallet 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mourdi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mourdi 2010</LINK>). A re-evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio of these drugs by the drug regulation agencies of the countries where they are licensed is necessary, particularly in the age group younger than two years.</P>

<P>The body of evidence identified allows a robust conclusion regarding patients younger than two years old. Indeed no study supports the use of acetylcysteine nor carbocysteine among this age group.

<P>The results of the present review have to be interpreted with caution because (i) it was based on a limited number of patients included in studies whose methodological quality was questionable, and which dated mainly from the 1970s and 1980s, (ii) these results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis), and (iii) millions of paediatric patients are exposed to these drugs each year in many European countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cano-Garcinu_x00f1_o-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cano Garcinuño 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cazzato-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzato 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalumeau-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalumeau 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collet-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collet 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duijvestijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duijvestijn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 2011</LINK>). These mucolytic agents seem to have some benefits on frequency, intensity and duration of symptoms, and appear to be safe in children older than two years. Regarding children younger than two years old, there are current strong<B> </B>concerns about the safety of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine (<LINK REF="REF-Mallet-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mallet 2011</LINK>). These concerns led to the withdrawal of their licence in this age group in France and Italy<B> </B>in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Mourdi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mourdi 2010</LINK>). Therefore, these drugs should only be used for acute respiratory tract infections in neonates and infants in the context of a randomised controlled trial.</P>

<P>An adequately powered, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetylcysteine or carbocysteine should be performed in patients under two years of age.

<P>Comment: I did not understand which criteria were selected to dertermine efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine drugs. Until now I thought they were of no interest in ARTI's and this article doesn't give me any point to change my point of view. Thank you for answer. </P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2013-04-09 11:28:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have just finished updating our review which will published soon. The criteria selected to determine efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine drugs are included in the 'Types of outcome measures'. I have also copied our conclusions<B>: </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcome measures</B>
</P>
<P>We included trials reporting at least one of the following outcome measures.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes</P>
<P>1. Time to resolution of clinical symptoms and/or signs (where clinical symptoms and signs may include increased respiratory rate, use of accessory respiratory muscles, abnormal lung examination, cough, sputum production, fever, or activity limitations).</P>
<P>2. Proportions of patients with clinical symptoms and/or signs at a designated time.</P>
<P>3. Global assessment of improvement by clinicians, patients or their parents at a designated time.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes</P>
<P>1.       Reduced hospitalisation rates and/or duration of hospitalisation stay.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The results have to be interpreted with caution because they are based on a limited number of participants included in studies whose methodological quality is questionable. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine seem to have a limited efficacy and appear to be safe in children older than two years. These results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self-limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). Given strong concerns about safety, these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower RTIs in the context of a RCT with regards to children younger than two years. </P>
