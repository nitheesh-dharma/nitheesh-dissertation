I have merely removed the possibility of significant benefit or harm from SGRQ results, but I think it should still be low in view of possible attrition and other biases. Might be interesting to revisit this SoF?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks and ready to publish,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing Jan 24th 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have corrected the SoF table for the control group scores in SGRQ. Grade Pro had not produced this correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following input from Peter Gibson I have amended some of the description of the results and conclusions (mostly in the abstract). I have reordered the graphs so that the SoF outcomes are shown first, and these are now discussed first in the text. Some of the wording has also been copy edited, so that demonstrated no significant difference now reads &amp;quot;did not demonstrate a significant difference in the number of hospitalisations&amp;quot; for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your hard work on this update. It is now ready for copy editing and publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing Nov 15th 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you ask Peter to look at the revised version of this review before it goes back to the authors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the SoF table to include a downgrade for wide confidence intervals.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-01 16:16:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Home visits from nurses for people with chronic lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD - a combinations of emphysema and chronic bronchitis) aim to help people maintain their health and reduce the need for hospital stays. The nurses delivering this care aim to help people use their treatments well, provide education about coping strategies, and monitor the lung disease. However, this review of nine randomised controlled trial found that home care resulted in an improvement in people's quality of life, but has an unpredictable effect on the risk of being admitted to hospital. We could only find information on the cost of care from one study, but this indicated that home care was an expensive form of care. More research is needed to confirm the usefulness of home visits for people with COPD.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-09 04:39:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by progressive airflow obstruction, worsening exercise performance and health deterioration. It is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and health system burden.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:19:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of outreach respiratory health care worker programmes for COPD patients in terms of improving lung function, exercise tolerance and health related quality of life (HRQL) of patient and carer, and reducing mortality and medical service utilisation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-16 16:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials was searched (November 2011). Study references were hand-searched for additional studies we contacted study authors to identify other unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-01-24 11:37:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included only randomised controlled trials of COPD patients. We included interventions involving an outreach nurse visiting patients in their homes, providing support, education, monitoring health and liaising with physicians. Studies in which the therapeutic intervention under test was physical training were not included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-24 11:38:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-28 14:14:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We pooled mortality data from eight studies and found a non-significant reduction in mortality at 12 months (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45 to, 1.15).</P>
<P>We pooled four studies that assessed disease-specific heath-related quality of life (HRQL) and found a statistically significant improvement in HRQL (mean difference -2.61, 95% CI -4.82 to -0.40).</P>
<P>Hospitalisations were reported in five studies. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the number of hospitalisations (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.44), there was significant heterogeneity. Although this heterogeneity appeared to be caused by one outlying study with a statistically significant decrease in hospitalisations in patients receiving home care, whereas the other studies showed a non-significant increase in hospitalisations, we could not draw firm conclusions about why this heterogeneity exists. Data on GP visits and emergency department presentations were available, however no consistent effect in these was observed with the intervention. The intervention also incurred higher health care costs than standard care as reported in a single study.</P>
<P>Very few studies provided data on lung function or exercise performance, so there was insufficient evidence to assess impact on these outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-25 09:56:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Outreach nursing programmes for COPD improved disease-specific HRQL. However the effect on hospitalisations was heterogeneous, reducing admissions in one study, but increasing them in others, therefore we could not draw firm conclusions for this outcome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-01 16:16:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with substantial morbidity and costs to the health care system. The prevalence of COPD is increasing in the community and represents a serious public health issue.</P>
<P>Outreach healthcare delivery in the community, given by a respiratory health worker, may benefit patients with COPD by encouraging self-management behaviour with education about pulmonary disease, medication (in particular, the correct inhaler technique) and coping strategies. Also, regular visits, including objective measures of lung function, permits greater surveillance of deteriorations. The desired outcome of an outreach care programme is to maintain the patient's optimal respiratory state, thus maintaining health status and reducing hospital admissions. With increasing interest in outreach 'shared care' and 'coordinated care' programmes it is important to evaluate the available evidence as to whether such programmes improve the lives of patients with COPD and those who care for them.</P>
<P>Our aim was to update this systematic review evaluating the impact of outreach nursing care in patients with COPD.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-11-12 18:32:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Search and critically appraise the relevant literature, in order to determine the strength of the evidence, that outreach respiratory nursing care may:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Improve lung function (as measured by FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) and exercise and tolerance;</LI>
<LI>Improve health related quality of life (HRQL) of patients with COPD;</LI>
<LI>Reduce mortality;</LI>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-01 16:16:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included interventions comprising home visits by a respiratory nurse or similar respiratory health worker, to facilitate health care, provide education, provide social support, identify respiratory deteriorations promptly and reinforce correct technique with inhaler therapy. Eligible control groups were patients who received routine care, without respiratory nurse/health worker input. We considered studies with co-interventions, with subgroup analysis as necessary. We included only trials with at least three months of follow-up as it this was considered an appropriate minimum duration of follow-up to observe any clinically significant benefits of the intervention.</P>

For full details of the trials, see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. </P>
<P>A total of 1498 participants were included in these nine studies. Participants had moderately severe disease as assessed by inclusion criteria such as patient symptoms, recent exacerbations, hospitalisations and spirometry results. Published details on baseline severity for all the studies are available in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In brief, all studies investigated the effects of a supervised, home-based intervention in patients with COPD using a parallel group RCT design. The home-based intervention represented a respiratory nurse providing care, education and support in a patient's home. The effects of this was assessed via a variety of outcomes, including patient based outcomes (lung function, exercise testing, HRQL and mortality), health system based outcomes (medical service utilisation), and carer based outcomes (HRQL, satisfaction).</P>

This is a disease-specific questionnaire for COPD. Using this questionnaire, a change of four units is clinically significant. Unpublished data was obtained from one of the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Littlejohns-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Littlejohns 1991</LINK>. Data for the change in SGRQ total score was available from all four studies, and meta-analysis demonstrated that HRQL by this questionnaire improved with the intervention (MD -2.60; 95% CI -4.81 to -0.39; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) and this was a statistically significant difference.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-28 14:14:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Nine studies assessed the benefits of outreach nursing care for patients with COPD in 1498 patients. A number of outcomes which were only reported by single studies in the original review were now reported by multiple studies, permitting pooled analysis on a greater number of outcomes.</P>
<P>Whilst there was some methodological variation in the delivery and assessment of the intervention across studies, most notably with regard to study duration, sample size and the frequency of assessment, all investigated the effects of a supervised, home-based intervention in patients with COPD using a parallel group RCT design. The home-based interventions represented a respiratory nurse providing care, education and support in a patient's home. Studies employed a variety of outcome measures which allowed some pooled analysis. Whilst the studies were conducted over a wide time range, there did not appear to be any obvious effect related to the year of study.</P>
<P>There was insufficient data available to determine the effect of home care interventions on lung function and exercise capacity.</P>
<P>Quality of life was measure by a number of HRQL questionnaires. Meta-analysis of data from four studies employing the disease specific SGRQ found a significant improvement in HRQL in patients receiving with outreach nursing care compared to those receiving usual care. Two general health status questionnaires were administered in a number of studies, however insufficient data was available for pooled analysis. However, in contrast to the improvement in disease-specific health questionnaire the individual results of the general health status questionnaires were mixed.</P>
<P>Mortality data was available from eight studies. Meta-analysis demonstrated a decrease in the number of deaths with outreach nursing care, but this was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Data on medical service utilisation was available from a number of studies. Hospitalisations were reported in five studies. Overall, meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant change in the number of hospitalisations. However, significant statistical heterogeneity was seen with one outlying study (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>), which reported a statistically significant decrease in hospitalisations with the intervention, in contrast to the other four studies reporting hospitalisations which reported increases in hospitalisations with the intervention. It was not readily apparent why one study reported results in contrast to the others, however excluding this study revealed a statistically significant increase in the number of hospitalisations in patients receiving the home care intervention in the remaining four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cockcroft-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cockcroft 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hermiz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hermiz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kwok-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kwok 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>). We did not specify sub group analyses to investigate heterogeneity a priori and we do not have an explanation for the conflicting direction of the treatment effects in these studies. The increase in hospitalisations in patients receiving home care in the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cockcroft-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cockcroft 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hermiz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hermiz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kwok-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kwok 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>) seems to conflict with the improvement in quality of life and mortality found in these same patients. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be that the educational component of outreach nursing may enable patients to recognise deteriorations promptly, seeking medical service assistance where necessary and thus improving overall quality of life and mortality.</P>
<P>Data on GP or family doctor visits and emergency department presentations was also available from two studies. However, insufficient data was available for pooled analysis and there was no clear trend with the individual results of studies.</P>
<P>Though there were potential improvements in quality of life and mortality, the home care intervention may incur substantially higher health care costs than standard outpatient care for COPD as reported by <LINK REF="STD-Bergner-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bergner 1988</LINK>, although this is an old study and may not represent the true cost of these interventions today.</P>
