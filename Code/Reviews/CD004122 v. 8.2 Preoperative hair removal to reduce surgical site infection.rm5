<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-14 16:48:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditionally, patients undergoing surgery have hair removed from the site of the incision, as this is thought to reduce the chance of the surgical site becoming infected. Hair can be removed by several different methods which include shaving, clipping the hair and using a cream which dissolves the hair. Existing research studies are too small and methodologically flawed to allow us to draw strong conclusions; on the basis of existing evidence it is not clear whether hair removal pre-operatively affects rates of surgical site infections. However if hair has to be removed to facilitate surgery or the application of adhesive dressings, clipping rather than shaving appears to result in fewer surgical site infections.</P>

<P>We included 14 trials (17 comparisons) in the review; three trials involved multiple comparisons. Six trials, two of which had three comparison arms, (972 participants) compared hair removal (shaving, clipping, or depilatory cream) with no hair removal and found no statistically significant difference in SSI rates however the comparison is underpowered. Three trials (1343 participants) that compared shaving with clipping showed significantly more SSIs associated with shaving (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.80). Seven trials (1213 participants) found no significant difference in SSI rates when hair removal by shaving was compared with depilatory cream (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.21), however this comparison is also underpowered. One trial compared two groups that shaved or clipped hair on the day of surgery compared with the day before surgery; there was no statistically significant difference in the number of SSIs between groups however this comparison was also underpowered.</P>
<P>We identified no trials that compared clipping with depilatory cream; or investigated application of depilatory cream at different pre-operative time points, or hair removal in different settings (e.g. ward, anaesthetic room).</P>

<P>Whilst this review found no statistically significant effect on SSI rates of hair removal insufficient numbers of people have been involved in this research to allow confidence in a conclusion. When it is necessary to remove hair, the existing evidence suggests that clippers are associated with fewer SSIs than razors. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between depilatory creams and shaving, or between shaving or clipping the day before surgery or on the day of surgery however studies were small and more research is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-14 16:08:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-03 10:44:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The preparation of people for surgery has traditionally included the routine removal of body hair from the intended site of surgical incision. Hair is removed because its presence can interfere with the exposure of the incision and subsequent wound, the suturing of the incision and the application of adhesive drapes and wound dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Hallstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hallstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>). Hair is also perceived to be associated with a lack of cleanliness, and the removal of hair is thought to reduce the risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK>). There are studies, however, which claim that preoperative hair removal is not beneficial, perhaps causes SSIs, and should not be done (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Court-Brown-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Court Brown 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horgan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Horgan 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) categorises SSIs as: superficial, deep incisional or organ-space, and states that the presence of infection should be identified using both clinical and laboratory findings, and may include the presence of at least one of the following; pus, pain, tenderness, swelling or redness (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). SSIs are experienced by around 10% of patients in the UK each year (<LINK REF="REF-NINSS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 2001</LINK>), and can result in delayed wound healing, increased hospital stays, unnecessary pain, and, in extreme cases, the death of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Emmerson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmerson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plowman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-09-14 16:08:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three methods of hair removal are currently used; shaving, clipping and chemical depilation. Shaving is the commonest and cheapest method of hair removal. This method uses a sharp blade, held within the head of a razor, which is drawn over the patient's skin to cut hair close to the surface of the skin.</P>
<P>Clippers use fine teeth to cut hair close to the patient's skin, leaving a short stubble that is usually around one millimetre in length. The heads of clippers can be disposed of between patients to minimise the risks of cross infection.</P>
<P>Depilatory creams are chemicals which dissolve the hair itself. This is a slower process than either shaving or clipping, as the cream has to remain in contact with the hair for between five and 20 minutes. In addition, there is a risk of irritant or allergic reactions to the cream, so patch tests should be carried out 24 hours before the cream is applied for the first time.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-03 10:44:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During the process of shaving, the skin may experience microscopic cuts and abrasions. It is believed that micro-organisms are able to enter and colonise these cuts, thus contaminating the surgical incision site and causing SSIs (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 1997</LINK>). In addition, abrasions may exude tissue fluid, which provides a culture medium for micro-organisms (<LINK REF="STD-Seropian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Seropian 1971</LINK>). Since clippers do not come into contact with the patient's skin, they are thought to reduce the risk of cuts and abrasions (<LINK REF="REF-Fogg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fogg 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Shaving and clipping can be carried out in operating theatres, anaesthetic rooms, wards or in people's homes by theatre staff, ward staff, or by patients themselves. Chemical depilation is usually carried out on wards, or in the home, as it requires more time. Research has suggested, however, that hair removal should not take place in the operating theatre as loose hair may contaminate the sterile surgical field (<LINK REF="REF-Mews-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mews 2000</LINK>). Others have suggested that hair removal should be carried out by skilled personnel to prevent abrasion injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Hallstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hallstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Small-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1996</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-09-14 16:08:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preoperative hair removal practices vary throughout the world. For example, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) strongly recommends that hair should not be removed preoperatively unless the hair at or around the incision site will interfere with the operation (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). This recommendation differs from the Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-NOKC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOKC 2000</LINK>), which states that <I>'contrary to the recommendations given by CDC, it is not strongly recommended to avoid preoperative hair removal'</I>. The Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment found that strong evidence does not exist either in favour of, or against, preoperative hair removal, while the British Hospital Infection Society Working Party guidelines recommend that <I>'only the area to be incised needs to be shaved'</I> and that shaving should be avoided if possible (<LINK REF="REF-Hospital-Infection-Society-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hospital Infection Society 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of preoperative shaving was published in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK>). The search strategy for this review included both randomised and observational studies published up to 1999. Evidence for not removing hair came only from observational studies. Strong evidence was found in support of clipping in preference to shaving. Observational studies supported depilation rather than shaving. Moderate evidence, based on observational studies and a randomised study (though this was not statistically significant) found that removal of hair should be done as close to surgery as possible. The recommendations of the Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment are based on the findings of the Kjonniksen review (<LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOKC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOKC 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>If removal of hair is necessary, for example if the surgical site is located in an area covered by thick, dense, or long body hair, the three organisations recommend slightly different methods of removal. The CDC guidelines recommend removal of hair immediately before surgery, and preferably with clippers (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>); the Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment guidelines recommend using clippers or cream as close to the surgery as possible (<LINK REF="REF-NOKC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOKC 2000</LINK>); and the Hospital Infection Society Working Party guidelines recommend using cream the day before surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hospital-Infection-Society-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hospital Infection Society 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Having a hairless surgical site may ease surgery, the application of dressings and reduce potential infection, as hair is a source of bacteria, but the process of removing hair may cause primary infection because of microscopic cuts to the skin. This review will assess the relative benefits and harms of hair removal, the different methods of hair removal, and the effect of timing of hair removal.</P>
<P>The Cochrane review of preoperative hair removal was first published in 2006 (Tanner 2006). This review is the first update of the original review and four new trials have been included (<LINK REF="STD-Abouzari-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abouzari 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nascimento-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nascimento 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilankovan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ilankovan 1992</LINK>); with <LINK REF="STD-Ilankovan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ilankovan 1992</LINK> having been previously excluded. One trial which was previously included has been excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Ko-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ko 1992</LINK>). The original Cochrane review of preoperative hair removal has been published as a journal article (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 2007</LINK>) and a Joanna Briggs Best Practice paper (<LINK REF="REF-Hemingway-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemingway 2007</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-09-14 16:09:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review update, two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance)(see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement will be based). Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study and discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus. We presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'risk of bias summary figure', which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<P>Data were entered into the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5 software. Results are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All outcomes are dichotomous, and are reported as risk ratio (RR). We examined clinical heterogeneity, looking at the setting of the study, the type of surgery, type of intervention, the sample size and the quality of the study. Before we pooled data, we also considered statistical heterogeneity looking at sample sizes and I<SUP>2</SUP> values (Higgins 2003). In the presence of statistical heterogeneity - but where clinical factors suggested pooling was appropriate - a random-effects model was used. A fixed-effect model was used in the absence of both clinical and statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-03 10:53:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Looking firstly at the evidence for pre-operative hair removal by any method versus no hair removal, whilst we found no statistically significant difference in SSI rates in the existing 4 trials, there were more SSIs in the shaving group and this comparison is likely to be underpowered, with only 38 events in the whole comparison. We therefore cannot confidently exclude the possibility of an effect of hair removal in either direction and current evidence (which is also at risk of bias) suggests a possible increase in SSIs after hair removal. The recommendations of the CDC (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>), and the Hospital Infection Society (<LINK REF="REF-Hospital-Infection-Society-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hospital Infection Society 2003</LINK>), strongly recommend that shaving should be avoided unless completely necessary. The earlier systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK>), and the Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-NOKC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOKC 2000</LINK>), state that no strong evidence exists in favour of, or against, preoperative hair removal.</P>
<P>Looking at alternative methods of hair removal, we found evidence to suggest that clipping rather than shaving results in fewer SSIs; supporting the recommendations of the CDC (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>), and The Norwegian Health Technology Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-NOKC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOKC 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst the Hospital Infection Society recommends that depilatory cream should be used instead of shaving with a razor (<LINK REF="REF-Hospital-Infection-Society-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hospital Infection Society 2003</LINK>), we did not find a significant difference in SSI rates from the seven existing trials comparing creams and razors although more SSIs occurred in the shaving group. Again we must emphasise that this is an underpowered comparison with only 65 SSIs in total across the seven trials. No trials compared the relative effects of clipping and depilatory cream.</P>
<P>We did not find a significant effect of the timing of hair removal on SSI rates, however this comparison is also underpowered and we cannot exclude the possibility of an effect. No trial compared use of depilatory cream on the day of surgery with use one day preoperatively. Evidence from randomised controlled trials in this review does not support either the CDC recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>), or the Norwegian Health Technology Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-NOKC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOKC 2000</LINK>), both of which advocate hair removal immediately before surgery. It is not possible to support, or refute, the recommendations of the Hospital Infection Society (<LINK REF="REF-Hospital-Infection-Society-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hospital Infection Society 2003</LINK>), which recommends using depilatory cream the day before surgery in order to reduce SSIs.</P>
<P>No trials were identified for inclusion in the review that evaluated the effect on SSIs of hair removal in different settings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison with earlier systematic review</HEADING>
<P>The search strategy for the previous systematic review covered the period up to 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK>), and the review included nine RCTs and 12 observational studies. The observational studies included controlled studies, quasi-experimental studies and non-experimental observational studies. A comparison between the review by <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK> and this review revealed some differences in which studies were included. <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK> classified the study by <LINK REF="STD-Seropian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Seropian 1971</LINK> as an observational study due to uncertainties regarding randomisation, however <LINK REF="STD-Seropian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Seropian 1971</LINK> reported group allocation by patient number, which was accepted as a suitable method of quasi randomisation and was thus included in this review. Using this method participants were allocated to two groups (shaving and cream) but the publication also reported data for people who were excluded from the study as a third group. This review included data from the two groups that were subject to the allocation procedure, and excluded data relating to people who were not (<LINK REF="STD-Seropian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Seropian 1971</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK> included <LINK REF="STD-Hoe-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hoe 1985</LINK> as a randomised study, but attributed this study less importance due to its method of design. Our review did not include <LINK REF="STD-Hoe-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hoe 1985</LINK>, as people within the non-shaving group were shaved, if necessary, and, therefore, there was contamination. Unlike <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK>, our review rejected the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ko-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ko 1992</LINK> because the patients in the intervention groups had hair removed, and also underwent irrigation with antiseptic. <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK> did not include the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ilankovan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ilankovan 1992</LINK>. It was included in this review because the authors did measure surgical site infection but provided limited detail as to the incidence of SSI. <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK> described the <LINK REF="STD-Powis-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Powis 1976</LINK> study as irrelevant, as it only included a limited number of people, but our review includes <LINK REF="STD-Powis-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Powis 1976</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Kjonniksen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjonniksen 2002</LINK> did not identify three RCTs that are included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Breiting-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Breiting 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nascimento-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nascimento 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Breiting-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Breiting 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK> were both published in Danish, and <LINK REF="STD-Nascimento-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nascimento 1991</LINK> in Portuguese.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methodological quality of the studies</HEADING>
<P>Fourteen eligible trials were included in this review. The methodological quality and the reporting of methods for most of these trials was poor. None of the trials was identified as being at low risk of bias. Four of the trials provide sufficient details of the process of randomisation or allocation to allow us to judge their adequacy (<LINK REF="STD-Celik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balthazar-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Balthazar 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goeau_x002d_Brissonniere-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Goeau-Brissonniere 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilankovan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ilankovan 1992</LINK>), the rest did not. Similarly, the study setting and timing of hair removal relative to surgery were often poorly reported. Often the identity of the outcome assessor and the timing of assessment were not clear. Most of the trials provided information on the sex, age and the surgical procedure carried out (<LINK REF="STD-Abouzari-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abouzari 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balthazar-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Balthazar 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breiting-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Breiting 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Court-Brown-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Court Brown 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goeau_x002d_Brissonniere-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Goeau-Brissonniere 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilankovan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ilankovan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nascimento-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nascimento 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojanapirom-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rojanapirom 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thur-de-Koos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Thur de Koos 1983</LINK>), which allowed baseline comparisons to be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>All trials reported reduction of SSIs as an objective, although their definitions of infection varied. Five trials did not provide any definition for an SSI (<LINK REF="STD-Breiting-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Breiting 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojanapirom-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rojanapirom 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seropian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Seropian 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thur-de-Koos-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Thur de Koos 1983</LINK>), but the remaining trials did provide a definition of an infection; e.g. presence of pus. None of the trials referred to standardised definitions of SSIs such as those published by the <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>More than half the trials used bacterial swabs and a visual assessment to determine the presence of infection, while the remaining trials used visual assessment only. Some trials did not state when the assessments were carried out, and there was little parity among the trials that did provide details. Though most trial reports stated that assessment was carried out at patient discharge, this was not defined in terms of number of postoperative days.</P>
<P>Duration of follow-up was short in several trials. Follow-up for SSI should be for 30 days, as advocated by the <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes of this review, wound complications, length of hospital stay and financial cost of hair removal method, were poorly addressed. One trial discussed the length of hospital stay and, while three studies provided details of the cost of the hair removal products (<LINK REF="STD-Court-Brown-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Court Brown 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powis-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Powis 1976</LINK>),<B> </B>additional information about costs such as time required by hospital staff to use either method, additional dressings for infected wounds or additional costs incurred by extended hospital stay due to SSIs were not given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations of trials</HEADING>
<P>All trials included in this review had limitations. Reporting of the trial design was usually poor, in that most authors did not provide details of the method used to generate the randomisation sequence, the method of allocation concealment, and whether blinding of outcome assessors was undertaken. Few trials explicitly stated drop-out rates. Review authors should consider contacting trial authors as a matter of routine to obtain further information on trial design. Accepted definitions of SSI and follow-up periods could have been referred to in the trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Eight articles were identified in languages other than English and required translations; four of these were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Breiting-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Breiting 1981</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Goeau_x002d_Brissonniere-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Goeau-Brissonniere 1987</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Nascimento-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nascimento 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK>). Two of the four manufacturers we contacted provided details of trials, though all of these studies had already been identified through searching the databases. Three studies acknowledged companies for providing the depilatory cream used in their trials (<LINK REF="STD-Powis-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Powis 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seropian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Seropian 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorup-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Thorup 1985</LINK>).</P>

<P>The review found insufficient evidence for an effect of preoperative hair removal on rates of SSIs (SSIs). If it is necessary to remove hair, then clipping seems to result in fewer SSIs than shaving with a razor, although the evidence is not high quality. It is not possible to say whether use of depilatory creams is preferable to shaving with a razor as this comparison is underpowered. No trials compared clipping with depilatory cream.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence concerning the rates of SSIs when patients are shaved (or clipped) the day before surgery or on the day of surgery. There has been no research investigating the timing of hair removal when using a depilatory cream.</P>
<P>There is no research to indicate whether the place of hair removal (e.g. operating theatre, anaesthetic room or ward area) affects SSI rates.</P>

<P>We searched the bibliographies of all retrieved and relevant publications identified by these strategies for further studies. In addition, we contacted the following manufacturers of hair removal products to obtain information of any unpublished studies; Cardinal Health, Alliance Medical, Hallstar and 3M Health Care Ltd. Both 3M Health Care Ltd and Cardinal Health responded and provided articles on hair removal. All of the articles provided by the manufacturers had already been obtained through the search strategy</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­ opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>

<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
