<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of multifocal compared with monofocal intraocular lenses after cataract extraction. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 20 studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
</P>
<P>The review shows that people who have a multifocal intraocular lens after their cataract is removed may be less likely to need additional spectacles. However, they may experience more visual problems, such as glare or haloes (rings around lights), compared with people who have monofocal lenses.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>As people get older, sometimes the lens of the eye becomes cloudy leading to loss of vision. The cloudy lens is known as a 'cataract'. The cataract can be removed and a replacement lens put in its place. Usually the replacement lens has one 'point of focus'. This means that a person's vision after cataract surgery is either good for distance vision (driving, watching television) or good for near vision (reading, sewing) but not good for both. This standard lens is known as a 'monofocal' lens. People who get a monofocal lens will need to use spectacles for either distance or, more usually, for near vision.</P>
<P>To address this problem, new lenses have been developed that provide two or more points of focus. These are known as 'multifocal' lenses. These are designed to reduce the need for spectacles. People with multifocal lenses may have more vision problems such as glare and seeing haloes. Another option is to put a different monofocal lens in each eye: one with a focus for near vision and one with a focus for distance vision. This is known as 'monovision'.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane researchers found 20 relevant studies that were mainly conducted in Europe and North America (15 studies); three studies were conducted in China and one study each in the Middle East and India. Eighteen studies compared multifocal with monofocal lenses and two studies compared multifocal lenses with monovision.</P>
<P>The Cochrane researchers assessed how certain the evidence is for each review finding. They looked for factors that can make the evidence less certain, such as problems with the way the studies were done, very small studies, and inconsistent findings across studies. They also looked for factors that can make the evidence more certain, including very large effects. They graded each finding as very low, low, moderate or high certainty</P>
<P>The review shows that:</P>
<P>&#8226; People with multifocal lenses probably have distance vision that is not very different to the distance vision of people who have standard monofocal lenses after cataract extraction (moderate-certainty evidence). However, people with multifocal lenses may have better near vision and may be less likely to need spectacles compared with people with monofocal lenses (low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>&#8226; People who have multifocal lenses may be more likely to experience haloes and glare compared with people who have monofocal lenses (low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>&#8226; People receiving multifocal lenses had similar distance vision and near vision compared with people receiving monovision but reported less spectacle dependence. People with multifocal lenses reported more problems with glare and haloes compared with people with monovision.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 13 June 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-22 10:51:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Good unaided distance visual acuity (VA) is now a realistic expectation following cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Near vision, however, still requires additional refractive power, usually in the form of reading glasses. Multiple optic (multifocal) IOLs are available which claim to allow good vision at a range of distances. It is unclear whether this benefit outweighs the optical compromises inherent in multifocal IOLs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-21 08:27:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To assess the visual effects of multifocal IOLs in comparison with the current standard treatment of monofocal lens implantation.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-25 13:47:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), the ISRCTN registry (<A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch">www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 13 June 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-05-26 10:58:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing a multifocal IOL of any type with a monofocal IOL as control were included. Both unilateral and bilateral implantation trials were included. We also considered trials comparing multifocal IOLs with "monovision" whereby one eye is corrected for distance vision and one eye corrected for near vision. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 08:29:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the 'certainty' of the evidence using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:27:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 20 eligible trials that enrolled 2230 people with data available on 2061 people (3194 eyes). These trials were conducted in Europe (13), China (three), USA (one), Middle East (one), India (one) and one multicentre study in Europe and the USA. Most of these trials compared multifocal with monofocal lenses; two trials compared multifocal lenses with monovision. There was considerable variety in the make and model of lenses implanted. Overall we considered the trials at risk of performance and detection bias because it was difficult to mask participants and outcome assessors. It was also difficult to assess the role of reporting bias.</P>
<P>There was moderate-certainty evidence that the distance acuity achieved with multifocal lenses was not different to that achieved with monofocal lenses (unaided VA worse than 6/6: pooled RR 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.03; eyes = 682; studies = 8). People receiving multifocal lenses may achieve better near vision (RR for unaided near VA worse than J3/J4 was 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.58; eyes = 782; studies = 8). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence because of risk of bias in the included studies and high heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93%) although all included studies favoured multifocal lenses with respect to this outcome.</P>
<P>People receiving multifocal lenses may be less spectacle dependent (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.73; eyes = 1000; studies = 10). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence because of risk of bias and evidence of publication bias (skewed funnel plot). There was also high heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%) but all studies favoured multifocal lenses. We did not additionally downgrade for this. </P>
<P>Adverse subjective visual phenomena were more prevalent and more troublesome in participants with a multifocal IOL compared with monofocals (RR for glare 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93; eyes = 544; studies = 7, low-certainty evidence and RR for haloes 3.58, 95% CI 1.99 to 6.46; eyes = 662; studies = 7; moderate-certainty evidence). </P>
<P>Two studies compared multifocal lenses with monovision. There was no evidence for any important differences in distance VA between the groups (mean difference (MD) 0.02 logMAR, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; eyes = 186; studies = 1), unaided intermediate VA (MD 0.07 logMAR, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.10; eyes = 181; studies = 1) and unaided near VA (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.00; eyes = 186; studies = 1) compared with people receiving monovision. People receiving multifocal lenses were less likely to be spectacle dependent (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.53; eyes = 262; studies = 2) but more likely to report problems with glare (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.73; eyes = 187; studies = 1) compared with people receiving monovision. In one study, the investigators noted that more people in the multifocal group underwent IOL exchange in the first year after surgery (6 participants with multifocal vs 0 participants with monovision).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:29:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multifocal IOLs are effective at improving near vision relative to monofocal IOLs although there is uncertainty as to the size of the effect. Whether that improvement outweighs the adverse effects of multifocal IOLs, such as glare and haloes, will vary between people. Motivation to achieve spectacle independence is likely to be the deciding factor.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-23 10:48:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-22 10:51:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Cataract, defined as the presence of visually impairing lens opacity in one or both eyes, is present in 30% of people aged 65 years and over in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1999</LINK>). Around 400,000 cataract extractions were performed in England in the year 2014 to 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with cataract usually present with one or more of the following symptoms: gradual reduction in visual acuity (VA), glare, change in glasses prescription and change in colour appreciation. The diagnosis may be made by the person's general practitioner or optometrist followed by referral to an ophthalmic surgeon for confirmation of the diagnosis and management. Many people with treatable visual impairment from cataract do not access health services (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-23 10:47:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cataracts causing only mild symptoms may not need treatment, while changes in glasses prescription due to cataract may simply be managed by the provision of new glasses. Where these options are inadequate the only treatment available is surgical extraction of the cataract. This is routinely accompanied by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) to replace the focusing power of the natural lens.</P>
<P>Current techniques of cataract surgery and IOL implantation allow accurate prediction of postoperative refraction. Existing standards of best-corrected postoperative VA (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1993</LINK>) are being replaced by an expectation of good uncorrected distance acuity. This has been driven partly by the change from cataract surgery using a large (10 mm) incision to small incision (2 mm to 4 mm) phacoemulsification surgery. This change is generally perceived to offer greater predictability of refractive outcomes, a necessary pre-requisite for good VA without the need for glasses. Cochrane systematic reviews comparing surgical approaches have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Ang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Silva-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Silva 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because standard IOLs have a fixed refractive power the focal length is also fixed (monofocal). This means that most people will require a reading addition to their distance glasses prescription (<LINK REF="REF-Javitt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javitt 1997</LINK>). While most people undergoing cataract surgery may be happy to use reading glasses, a proportion are likely to seek good unaided near vision as well as distance vision. The need for reading glasses for near vision is unlikely to be considered an important issue at present in low-income countries where the burden of blindness due to cataract is so high.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-23 10:48:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One approach to improve near VA is to modify the IOL. There are no IOLs currently available that can change shape during accommodation in the manner of the natural crystalline lens. A fixed-shape optic IOL could theoretically provide near vision if attempted accommodation resulted in forward displacement of the IOL. Efforts to design an IOL using this principle have so far been unsuccessful (<LINK REF="REF-Legeais-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legeais 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>An IOL can also provide near and distance vision if both powers are present within the optical zone. This has been attempted using diffractive optics or with zones of differing refractive power. Both types of IOL divide light up to focus at two (bifocal) or more (multifocal) points so that the person can focus on objects at more than one distance from them. IOLs of both types are currently commercially available.</P>
<P>Optical evaluation of multifocal IOLs has been performed in detail. Exact figures vary with the IOL tested but essentially a two- to three-fold increase in the depth of field is achieved at the expense of a 50% reduction in the contrast of the retinal image (<LINK REF="REF-Holladay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holladay 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1993</LINK>). Clinical evaluation of a multifocal IOL is less clear-cut. Several large studies, including non-randomised comparisons with monofocal IOLs, have indicated that the quality of vision with bifocal and multifocal IOLs is good (<LINK REF="REF-Gimbel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimbel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knorz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knorz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindstrom-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinert 1999</LINK>). The key question to be answered is whether the optical trade-off inherent in a multifocal IOL results in better or worse visual function compared to a monofocal IOL. Objective (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1993</LINK>) and subjective (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1996</LINK>) improvement in vision following cataract surgery with monofocal IOL implantation is so high that any study lacking a randomised control group as a comparator will be relatively uninformative.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-22 13:27:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>There is an extensive body of published data on both monofocal and multifocal IOLs describing largely successful outcomes. To draw some conclusions regarding the relative merits of the different IOL types we undertook a systematic review of the best quality data (that from randomised controlled trials).</P>

<P>The initial electronic searches found 239 titles and abstracts.

One trial did not include a monofocal control group and was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Walkow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Walkow 1997</LINK>).

On contacting the authors, we identified three as descriptions of the same cohort of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Haaskjold-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Haaskjold 1998a</LINK>). Interim data were available on 149 participants with five to six months' follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1996</LINK>), and a subsequent paper reported corrected distance acuity and contrast sensitivity data only (with no numerical data for contrast sensitivity) on 221 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Haaskjold-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haaskjold 1998b</LINK>). An unpublished report from the lens manufacturer described limited data on 190 participants at one year (<LINK REF="REF-Pharmacia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pharmacia 1995</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The total number of people enrolled was 2230. Of these people, 2061 (3194 eyes) were followed up and were included in the analyses. The smallest study randomised 40 people (<LINK REF="STD-Kamlesh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kamlesh 2001</LINK>) and the largest trial randomised 261 people (<LINK REF="STD-Javitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Javitt 2000</LINK>). All studies recruited people with age-related cataract with no other apparent ocular morbidity and without excess corneal astigmatism.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> shows the mean age and sex of people enrolled in these trials. The median mean age was 69 years and median percentage women was 57%.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The studies considered different types of multifocal lenses including refractive (10 studies), diffractive (six studies), mixture of refractive and diffractive lenses (three studies) and one study used a multifocal lens with both refractive and diffractive properties (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Two studies compared the multifocal lens to monovision (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cataract surgery performed in 16 studies was small incision phacoemulsification. Three studies employed extracapsular cataract extraction and one study included both types of surgery. In 12 studies the cataract surgery was bilateral in all or some people (participants had the same type of lens inserted into both eyes).</P>
<P>In cataract surgery, the lens capsule must be breached to gain access to the crystalline lens. A continuous circular tear (capsulorhexis) is preferred to the older 'can-opener' technique using multiple small tears or incisions because the incidence of postoperative IOL decentration is likely to be reduced. Decentration leads to induced astigmatism and a reduction in unaided VA. Most studies used capsulorhexis and four studies used envelope capsulotomy (<LINK REF="STD-el-Maghraby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">el Maghraby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Percival 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamlesh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kamlesh 2001</LINK>).</P>

Even trials using the same chart did not report the results in the same way - the data were described variously as contrast sensitivity, VA at different contrast levels and difference between high contrast and lower contrast acuity - and it was difficult to pool data for contrast sensitivity. Three studies assessed the extent of glare disability using the Brightness Acuity Tester (<LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harman 2008</LINK>), and most studies elicited information from participants as to the extent of problems with glare or haloes (or both).</P>

The other studies did not report any information on how the sequence was generated but were described as "randomised".</P>
<P>Seven studies provided a convincing description of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nijkamp-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nijkamp 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cillino-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cillino 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jusufovic-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jusufovic 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>), and authors for two studies confirmed allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-el-Maghraby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">el Maghraby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haaskjold-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Haaskjold 1998a</LINK>). Two studies were at high risk of allocation bias because methods of concealment were not clearly reported and there were baseline imbalances (<LINK REF="STD-Kamlesh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kamlesh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Masking (performance bias and detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>Four studies described masking of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Javitt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cillino-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cillino 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Harman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harman 2008</LINK>, the IOL type was disclosed to participants at the three-month visit. All outcomes for this study have therefore been reported for the three-month visit prior to the IOL disclosure, except for spectacle dependence and symptoms of glare/haloes that were only reported at the 18-month visit. Interestingly, following disclosure of multifocal IOL status, participants in this group showed an improvement in near vision and spectacle independence by the 18-month visit.</P>
<P>Several studies mentioned masking but it was not clear how successful it had been. In <LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>, participants were informed that the IOL type implanted would not be revealed to them until completion of the trial but a proportion of participants were reported to be unmasked; in <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2008</LINK>, participants were not told which lens they would receive but it was unclear whether any of them could have guessed; in <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2012</LINK>, the study was described as a "prospective, randomised, comparative, and observer-masked trial" but there was no information on masking in the study report; in <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2010</LINK>, participants and medical staff collecting data were masked but there was no information on the staff providing care.</P>
<P>The remaining studies did not mention masking and we have assumed therefore that it was not done. <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK> did not describe masking and on the clinical trials registry was described as 'open label'.</P>
<P>Three studies that were (possibly) not masked successfully to participants reported masking outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2010</LINK>).

<P>We judged attrition bias to be low risk in two studies where reasons and numbers of participants who exited the study after intervention and before outcomes were clearly reported and we thought unlikely to affect the outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>). Five studies were at high risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-el-Maghraby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">el Maghraby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Percival 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nijkamp-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nijkamp 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sen 2004</LINK>). This was either due to significant numbers of participants being lost to follow-up without clear indication of which group they had been randomised to, or exclusion of participants after randomisation based on outcome such as high astigmatism. However, most studies did not clearly report follow-up and it was difficult to make a judgement.</P>

<P>Eight studies reported the number of participants who did not achieve an unaided VA of 6/6 (n = 682) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). These tended to be older studies (<LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-el-Maghraby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">el Maghraby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Percival 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haaskjold-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Haaskjold 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jusufovic-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jusufovic 2011</LINK>). There was little evidence for any important difference between the two groups with a pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.03). We judged this to be moderate-certainty evidence, downgrading one level for risk of bias (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies reported mean unaided logMAR VA (n = 848) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There was substantial inconsistency (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 74%) but in all studies the mean difference between groups was less than 0.1 logMAR.</P>
<P>Eight studies reported the number of participants that did not achieve a corrected VA of 6/6 (n = 692) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Again these studies were older, all being conducted no later than 2004. There was inconsistency (i<SUP>2</SUP>=54%) possibly reflecting changes over time in lenses used. The individual study estimates ranged from RR 0.20 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.56) (<LINK REF="STD-Kamlesh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kamlesh 2001</LINK>) in favour of multifocal lenses to 1.50 (0.63 to 3.59) (<LINK REF="STD-Percival-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Percival 1993</LINK>) in favour of monofocal lenses.

The MD was therefore small at -0.10 logMAR (95% CI -0.14 to -0.06). Mean corrected logMAR intermediate VA was similar at 0.16 (SD 0.11) in the multifocal group and 0.24 (SD 0.11) in the monofocal group, with a small difference between groups (MD -0.08 logMAR, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.05).</P>

<P>Eight studies reported unaided near VA of worse than J3/J4 or equivalent (n = 782) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity in the method used for near VA measurement which may affect the accuracy of pooled outcomes. People receiving a multifocal lens were less likely to have poor near vision (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.58). We judged the evidence to be of low-certainty. We downgraded one level for risk of bias and one level for inconsistency between studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93%). The RRs ranged from 0.02 (<LINK REF="STD-Jusufovic-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jusufovic 2011</LINK>) to 0.73 (<LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>) in the individual studies (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Ten studies (n = 1000) reported the outcome of spectacle dependence for distance or near vision (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Fewer participants in the multifocal group were spectacle dependent in the multifocal compared with the monofocal group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.73). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%) but all studies favoured multifocal IOLs. Since there were data from 10 studies for this outcome, we produced a funnel plot to evaluate publication bias as planned in our protocol. This showed evidence of publication bias with a skewed pattern (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). We downgraded the evidence for spectacle independence one level for risk of bias and one level for publication bias. We did not additionally downgrade for inconsistency (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies reported spectacle dependence for distance vision (n = 618) which overall was reduced in the multifocal group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). However, there was some inconsistency between studies with two studies showing no overall difference and with the other two studies in favour of the multifocal group (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%).</P>
<P>Six studies reported spectacle dependence for near vision (n = 772) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Fewer participants in the multifocal group required spectacles for near vision (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.71).

More people in the multifocal group reported problems with glare: (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence downgrading one level for risk of bias and one level for imprecision as the lower CI was close to 1 (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Haloes</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies (n = 662) questioned participants regarding postoperative haloes. More people in the multifocal group reported haloes (RR 3.58, 95% CI 1.99 to 6.46) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). We judged this to be moderate-certainty evidence downgrading one level for risk of bias (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Dysphotopsia</HEADING>
<P>One study reported postoperative dysphotopsia (n = 114). There were more people with dysphotopsia in the multifocal group compared with the monofocal group (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.82) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Complications</HEADING>
<P>Complications of surgery can be expected to be similar for multifocal and monofocal IOLs as the lenses are similar in all but the design of the optics and require no modifications to surgical technique. Ten studies reported perioperative and postoperative complications (<LINK REF="STD-el-Maghraby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">el Maghraby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Percival 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Javitt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nijkamp-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nijkamp 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cillino-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cillino 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Harman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2012</LINK>). The incidence of complications was low and similar in the multifocal and monofocal groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We did two subgroup analyses: refractive lenses versus diffractive lenses (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>) and bilateral surgery versus unilateral surgery (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>These analyses must be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of studies in each group which means the test for interaction may have low power and the large number of outcomes which may lead to spurious findings.</P>
<P>Comparing diffractive and refractive lenses, there was some indication that the diffractive lenses performed better. Specifically diffractive lenses had better visual function questionnaire scores and better satisfaction scores, and lower spectacle dependence.</P>
<P>The comparison between bilateral and unilateral surgery was difficult to interpret. There were two outcomes that had a significant P value for interaction, corrected distance VA worse than 6/6 and visual function scores, but in both these cases there was only one trial in some of the subgroups so it is difficult to attribute the difference in effect solely to this characteristic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We excluded studies at high risk of bias in one or more domain as planned in our protocol (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). There were some differences in outcome but these were not consistent and, due to the relatively high proportion of trials at high risk of bias, it is difficult to interpret these comparisons due to increased imprecision.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Multifocal lenses versus monovision</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared multifocal lenses with monovision (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>, the investigators enrolled 212 people who received bilateral sequential cataract surgery either to receive bilateral Tecnis ZM900 diffractive multifocal lenses or Akreos AO monofocal lenses with the powers adjusted to target -1.25 D monovision. The participants were followed up to four months and 187 (88%) were seen at that point.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK>, the investigators enrolled 75 people who received bilateral cataract surgery either to receive bilateral Isert PY60MV refractive multifocal lenses or SN60WF monofocal lenses with the powers adjusted to target -1.25 D monovision. The participants were followed up to six months. Follow-up was unclearly reported but the impression was given that all 75 participants were followed up.</P>
<P>There was no evidence for any important difference in distance VA between the two groups (MD 0.02 logMAR, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; n = 186; studies = 1) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>). The outcome was similar in <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK>, which reported decimal VA and showed similar distance VA in the two groups.</P>
<P>People receiving multifocal lenses had similar or very slightly worse unaided intermediate VA compared with people receiving monovision (MD 0.07 logMAR, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.10; n = 181; studies = 1) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>People receiving multifocal lenses had similar unaided near VA compared with people receiving monovision (MD -0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.00; n = 186; studies = 1) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) This was supported by <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK> which reported decimal VA and showed no significant difference in near VA between the two groups.</P>
<P>People receiving multifocal lenses were less likely to be spectacle dependent compared with people with monovision (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.53; n = 262; studies = 2; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK> reported these separately according to near and distance vision, with people receiving multifocal lenses being less likely to be spectacle dependent for near vision. There was little evidence of any effect on spectacle dependence for distance vision (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Contrast sensitivity was marginally better in the monovision group (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.02) in <LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK>, but there was little evidence for any difference in <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK> (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%, data not pooled) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>People receiving multifocal lenses were more likely to report glare compared to people receiving monovision (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.73; n = 187; studies = 1) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). This was supported by data from <LINK REF="STD-Labiris-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Labiris 2015</LINK>, which reported glare and "unwanted shadows" on a 4-point Likert scale. There were higher mean scores in the multifocal group for both glare (MD 0.15, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.30; n = 75; studies = 1) and shadows (MD 0.36, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.65; n = 75; studies = 1).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 2013</LINK> reported IOL exchange. Quote "In the first postoperative year, 6 patients (5.7%) in the multifocal group underwent IOL exchange (4 had a bilateral and 2 had a unilateral exchange). No patients in the monovision group underwent IOL exchange.<I>"</I>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-24 17:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results are summarised in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Distance VA was similar in the multifocal and monofocal groups but people with multifocal lenses achieved better near vision overall and were less dependent on spectacles. Adverse subjective visual phenomena, particularly haloes, were common and troublesome in people receiving multifocal IOLs.</P>
<P>There was some evidence that contrast sensitivity may be lower in people receiving multifocal IOLs. The differences were smaller than would be expected given the division of light between distance and near focus, which may result from visual processing. Whether the reduction in contrast sensitivity induced by the IOL would be clinically significant would depend on the contrast presented by the visual target and the contrast sensitivity of the person's retina. There were no significant differences between IOLs with respect to objective glare.</P>
<P>Participant satisfaction was not consistently reported between the two lens types. There was some evidence that participants with multifocal lenses experienced improved visual functioning for tasks requiring near vision compared to participants with monofocal lenses.</P>
<P>There was less evidence available for the comparison between multifocal lenses and monovision. The data available suggested similar distance and better near VA in the multifocal and monovision groups. Multifocal lenses were associated with less spectacle dependence but also an increased chance of experiencing glare and haloes compared with monovision.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:12:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten of the 20 included studies involved participants with surgery on both eyes and two studies had a mixture of both unilateral and bilateral surgery. Unilateral studies allow measurement of uniocular outcomes such as VA but are of limited use when attempting to measure the effect of the multifocal IOLs on quality of life, especially where the fellow eye has good vision. Of the studies that involved unilateral surgery only, <LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 1994</LINK> reported fellow eye vision as good, <LINK REF="STD-Percival-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Percival 1993</LINK> described the fellow eyes as cataractous and <LINK REF="STD-Jusufovic-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jusufovic 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2010</LINK> commented that participants had no prior ocular surgery suggesting a phakic status in the other eye. The other studies involving unilateral surgery and the two studies that performed surgery on one or both eyes did not comment on the status of the fellow eye.</P>
<P>We presented results as a combined group of refractive and diffractive IOL studies. Combination of data was valid as both IOL types use the same principle of simultaneous vision once incident light has been split by either the refractive or diffractive optic. <LINK REF="REF-Holladay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holladay 1990</LINK> found very similar optical properties of all multifocal IOLs tested including the Array refractive IOLs and the 3M diffractive IOL used in some of the studies reviewed here (the Pharmacia diffractive IOL is of a similar design to the 3M IOL). We presented separated data, which are likely to become more useful as further studies are published.</P>
<P>Unaided near vision is critical to assessment of multifocal efficacy but was reported in a manner that made comparison between studies difficult. Only eight studies reported unaided near VA worse than J3/J4 or equivalent, and five studies reported mean LogMAR unaided near VA allowing pooled data analysis. Furthermore, only seven studies reported both unaided and corrected near acuity and <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2008</LINK> reported corrected near acuity together with unaided near acuity but wearing a distance correction. Reading distances differed in the individual studies and it was unclear in most studies whether the reported print size read had been corrected for reading distance to allow a near acuity to be calculated. A further problem arose because Jaeger cards are not standardised between manufacturers so that J3 from one study cannot be assumed to equal J3 from another (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1978</LINK>). Despite these caveats, it is likely that unaided near vision is improved by a multifocal IOL. It is important to remember, however, that monofocal IOL near acuity can be restored using reading glasses.</P>
<P>This review has highlighted the need for a core set of outcome measures in trials comparing multifocal and monofocal lenses. Ideally these outcomes should be based on validated measures, particularly for the more subjective outcome measures.</P>
<P>The optical and visual effects of these IOLs are now well-known, particularly near vision. The search for alternative strategies to achieve spectacle independence, such as monovision and accommodating IOLs, should continue.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:12:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We graded the certainty of the evidence as low to moderate for those outcomes for which we could estimate an effect (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In general, we downgraded results for risk of bias because it was difficult to mask participants and outcome assessors in these trials and difficult to assess reporting bias. There was substantial methodological and statistical heterogeneity for some outcomes, in particular for the measurement of corrected distance VA and both unaided and corrected near VA, as well as participant-reported spectacle dependence. There was also some evidence of publication bias with respect to the outcome of spectacle dependence.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-21 13:10:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>One meta-analysis of outcomes of multifocal IOLs that included both randomised controlled trials and studies of other design found slightly better uncorrected distance VA in the monofocal groups but better uncorrected near VA and greater spectacle independence in the multifocal group, the latter being similar to the results from our analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Cochener-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochener 2011</LINK>). They also reported better near VA using diffractive (rather than refractive) multifocal IOLs, which is similar to the outcomes we found albeit with small numbers used for analysis. de Vries and colleagues conducted a review including both randomised controlled trials and case series (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 2013</LINK>). This was a narrative review summarising the outcomes of included studies but did not draw any definitive conclusions regarding outcomes that could be compared with results presented in this systematic Cochrane Review.</P>

<P>Multifocal intraocular lenses may result in better near vision without any adverse effect on distance acuity. Spectacle dependence is less likely with use of these intraocular lenses when compared to the standard practice of monofocal implantation.</P>
<P>Whether the improvement in unaided near vision and increased incidence of spectacle independence are sufficient to outweigh the experience of glare and haloes is a matter for each person to decide. The final choice is likely to depend on a person's motivation to be free of spectacles, guided by realistic expectations as to the likelihood of achieving this aim and understanding of the compromises involved.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-11-22 13:38:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The original protocol for this review was published in 2000. Since that time there have been substantive changes in recommended Cochrane Review methodology. We have added in specific information on the following methodological issues: unit of analysis, missing data and subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>For the update in 2016, we have collaborated with the National Institute of Care and Health Excellence (NICE) in the UK. NICE are preparing guidelines for cataract management and we agreed to work with them to ensure that the information in this review provided data relevant to the guideline. This mainly affected the comparisons and outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>We included an additional comparison: multifocal versus monovision. Monovision is a strategy designed to enable people to achieve good distance and near vision by adjusting the powers of the lenses such that one eye is used for distance vision and one for near vision.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We have added in intermediate visual acuity as an outcome.</P>
<P>For the 2016 update, we dropped depth of focus because the data on this were sparse and difficult to interpret because of considerable variability in measurement and reporting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We used Cochrane's tool for assessing the risk of bias (replacing the Jadad scale). In the 2012 update of this review, we assessed selective outcome reporting bias by completing an outcome reporting matrix using the ORBIT classification (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkham 2010</LINK>). In the 2016 update, we did not continue with this assessment but assessed selective outcome reporting as part of the risk of bias tool only.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we changed the measure of effect from odds ratio to risk ratio, reflecting changing views as to the relative suitability of the risk ratio/odds ratio as a measure of effect. Although the odds ratio has some statistical advantages, it is not as easily interpreted as the risk ratio and may overestimate the effect of the intervention, particularly when the event occurs commonly within the study population.</P>
<P>In the 2012 update of the review, we pooled visual acuity measured on different scales using the standardised mean difference. The standardised mean difference is difficult to interpret, however, and there is accumulating evidence that different visual acuity charts perform differently at different levels of visual acuity. For these reasons, we have changed our mind about the validity of doing this. As more data were available measured on the logMAR scale we restricted our analyses to studies measuring and reporting visual acuity data on the logMAR scale. We summarised these using the mean difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We have added in an additional subgroup analysis comparing unilateral and bilateral surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Following updated guidance from Cochrane (<LINK REF="REF-MECIR-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">MECIR 2013</LINK>), we have added in a sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias in one or more domains.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We prepared a 'Summary of findings' table, including assessing the quality of evidence using GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>).</P>

<B>Inclusion criteria:</B> both eyes had to be healthy, with no disease except cataract; required to understand the possible benefit of having implantation of a multifocal IOL instead of a monofocal IOL; have potential good vision in both eyes after cataract surgery and IOL implantation</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B> participants who would likely be more sensitive to glare, halos, and changes in contrast sensitivity; and who did not have realistic expectations of the new technology</P>
<P>
<B>Pretreatment:</B> there were no significant between-group differences in demographics including age, sex, education and profession. VA and the type of cataract were comparable between groups, and no participant in either group had ocular comorbidity in addition to cataract. The VF-7 and CS-5 values were almost identical in the 2 groups preoperatively, and the percentages of those reporting being dissatisfied with their vision (43.1% in multifocal group and 57.6% in monofocal group) or very dissatisfied with their vision (19.6% in multifocal group and 18.2% in monofocal group) were comparable. The proportion of participants with moderate (35.3% in multifocal group and 25.8% in monofocal group) or a great deal (25.5% in multifocal group and 21.2% in monofocal group) of self-reported trouble with vision was also comparable between the 2 groups</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-11-22 09:38:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The conclusions of the review abstract suggest that multifocals [intraocular lenses (IOL)] improved quality of near vision over the monofocal IOL, however in several studies noted (ie: Javitt &amp; Steinert) the refractive error targeted with monofocal IOLs is not mentioned. It is thus assumed that emmetropia was the goal, rather than monovision. A better question is how do patients with monovision IOL implants function compared to those with the Array [multifocal IOL] ? In my experience, patients prefer monovision! There is no glare or halo, and the quality of vision is sufficient for most to function unaided, including night driving.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-11-22 09:38:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Thank you for your comments.</P>
<P>The studies in this meta-analysis recruited patients into RCTs [randomised controlled trials] comparing a multifocal lens with a monofocal lens. None of the RCTs used monovision as either a control group or intervention group. Whilst this would be an interesting study (glare and haloes may be less in the monofocal monovision group, possibly at the expense of troublesome anisometropia), this scenario is not answered by this analysis.</P>
