<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Long acting depot preparations (decanoate and enanthate) of the oral antipsychotics perphenazine are available for people with schizophrenia. Evidence available for their efficacy and safety is limited. This review identifies randomised trials comparing depot perphenazine to other depot antipsychotics and perphenazine decanoate to enanthate.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. The development of depot injections in the 1960s gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are depot antipsychotics that belong to the phenothiazine family and have a piperazine ethanol side chain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of depot perphenazine decanoate and enanthate versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (June 1998), Biological Abstracts (1982-1998), the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1998), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1998), and PsycLIT (1974-1998) by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (March 2004). References of all identified trials were also inspected for more studies and industry contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We compared randomised clinical trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where depot perphenazine decanoate and enanthate, oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. For dichotomous data we estimated the Relative Risk (RR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). Analysis was by intention-to-treat.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only four studies (Ahlfors 1980, Eufe 1979, Knudsen 1985c, Tegeler 1979), randomising a total 313 people could be included in this review and this combined with an overall lack of usable data limits any interpretation of results. Perphenazine enanthate was not significantly any better or worse than other depot antipsychotics in most of the main outcomes such as global state, relapse or leaving the study early. We found some differences favouring the control groups for adverse effects.</P>
<P>One study (Ahlfors 1980) of six months' duration (n=172), compared perphenazine enanthate to clopenthixol decanoate. There were no differences between the two groups for outcomes of global improvement, relapse and leaving the study early. More people in the perphenazine enanthate group, however, required anticholinergic drugs than those allocated to clopenthixol decanoate (RR 1.12 CI 1.0 to 1.2, NNT 10).</P>
<P>A single study (n=64, duration six weeks) compared perphenazine enanthate and its longer acting decanoate ester. Data on relapse and leaving the study early failed to show convincing differences. The enanthate group, however, experienced more movement disorders (RR 1.36, CI 1.1 to 1.8 NNT 5) than those allocated the decanoate ester of the same drug and required more anticholinergic drugs (RR 1.47 CI 1.1 to 2.0, NNT 4).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Depot perphenazine is in clinical use in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands. At a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine. The total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313. None of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. Until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-30 11:48:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>One in every 10,000 people per year are diagnosed with schizophrenia, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>). It often runs a chronic course with acute exacerbations and often partial remissions. Antipsychotics are the main treatment for this illness (<LINK REF="REF-Dencker-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dencker 1980</LINK>). These are generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling symptoms such as hallucinations and fixed false beliefs (delusions) (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>). They seem to reduce the risk of acute relapse. A systematic review undertaken over a decade ago suggested that, for those with serious mental illness, stopping antipsychotics resulted in 58% of people relapsing, whereas only 16% of those who were still on the drugs became acutely ill within a one year period (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1986</LINK>). Evidence also points to the fact that experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia lowers a person's level of social functioning and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Curson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curson 1995</LINK>). Relapse prevention also has enormous financial implications. For example, within the UK, a department of health burden of disease analysis in 1996 indicated that schizophrenia accounted for 5.4% of all national heath service in-patient expenditure, placing it behind only learning disability and stroke in magnitude (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Aaes_x002d_Jorgenson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaes-Jorgenson 1985</LINK>) but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. Problems with treatment adherence are common throughout medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979</LINK>). Those who suffer from long term illnesses such as schizophrenia, where the treatments may have uncomfortable side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>), the individuals have cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-David-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1994</LINK>) and erosion of insight, are especially prone to not take medication on a regular basis. The development of depot injections in the 1960s and initial clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1973</LINK>) gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Depots mainly consist of an ester of the active drug held in an oily suspension. This is injected intramuscularly and is slowly released. Depots may be given every one to six weeks. Individuals may be maintained in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses, sometimes in clinics set up for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review is one of a series on the effects of depot antipsychotics for those with schizophrenia. The prevalence of depot perphenazine use is unclear, however, the authors are assured that it is widely used in Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Portugal but not licensed in Australia. We would welcome any data on its use.</P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate belong to the phenothiazine family and have a piperazine ethanol side chain. The depot preparation (perphenazine enanthate in sesame oil) is known by several trade names (trilafon enanthaat, trilafon enantat, trilifan retard, trilafon enantato, trilafon depot, decentan-depot, and peratsin enantaati). The depot perphenazine decanoate is also in sesame oil and can be known as trilafon decanoate, trilafon decanoat, trilafon dekanoat, and peratsin dekanoaatti. The decanoate is administered every two to four weeks and enanthate every 10-14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kundsen-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Kundsen 1985b</LINK>). Data suggests that the former preparation results in fewer fluctuations in blood plasma concentrations (<LINK REF="STD-Kundsen-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Kundsen 1985b</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered all relevant randomised controlled trials for inclusion. Where a study was described as 'double-blind' and it was implied that the study was randomised, and where the demographic details of each group's participants were similar, then we included these trials. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People with schizophrenia or other similar psychotic disorders, irrespective of mode of diagnosis, age, ethnicity and sex. Where a study described the participant group as suffering from 'serious/chronic mental illnesses' and did not give a particular diagnostic grouping, we included these trials. The exception to this rule was when the majority of those randomised clearly did not have a functional non-affective psychotic illness.</P>

<P>1. Reference searching<BR/>We also inspected the references of all identified trials for more studies.</P>
<P>2. Personal contact<BR/>We contacted the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials. We also contacted those companies producing depots and requested published and unpublished trials.</P>
</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Study selection<BR/>The principal reviewer (SQ) inspected all identified citations or studies. A randomly selected sample of 10% of all reports was re-inspected by AD in order to ensure selection was reliable. Where disagreement occurred we (SQ, AD) resolved this by discussion, or where there was still doubt, acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we independently decided whether they met the review criteria. Where disagreement occurred we resolved this by discussion and when this was not possible sought further information. We added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information. For the 2004 update JR independently inspected citations, identified studies and extracted relevant data.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Each reviewer allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to clarify into which category to allocate the trial, we did not enter data and the trial was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. We only included trials in Category A or B in the review. </P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We (SQ, AD) independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dispute, we did not enter data but added this outcome of the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>3.2 Incomplete data<BR/>Where more than 30% of those randomised were lost to follow-up by six months, or 50% by beyond that time, we felt the data were too prone to bias to use and did not report it. It was our intention to analyse the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (30-50%) in sensitivity analyses. If inclusion of data from this group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect of the primary outcomes, we would not have added the data from these studies to trials with less attrition, but would have presented them separately. </P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes, for example 'admitted' or 'not admitted', we estimated the fixed effect Relative Risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/) which takes account of the event rate in the relevant control group.</P>
<P>4.2 Intention to treat: Data was presented on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis. We assumed that those who were lost to follow up had the negative outcome, with the exception of the outcome of death. For example, for the outcome of relapse, we assumed that those who were lost to follow up all relapsed.</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data <BR/>4.3.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes we would have estimated a fixed effects weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. </P>
<P>4.3.3 Valid scales: we included continuous data from rating scales only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) and the instrument was either a self-report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). </P>
<P>4.3.4 Endpoint versus change data: we find it preferable to use scale end point data, which typically cannot have negative values and we find it somewhat easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are very problematic to interpret. If end point data were not available, we would have used change data.</P>
<P>4.3.5. Cluster trials: studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. </P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation co-efficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented, primarily, by employing the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate the data, but presented them separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing small study bias <BR/>We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>Where a trial was described as 'double-blind' but implied that the study was randomised, these trials were included in a sensitivity analysis. If there were no substantive differences within primary outcomes when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. However, if there was a substantive difference then only clearly randomised trails were used. The effect of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) will be analysed in sensitivity analyses. If inclusion of data from this group does result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect of the primary outcomes, data from these studies will be presented separately. A sensitivity analysis on the primary outcomes of this review (see Types of Outcomes) was conducted in order to investigate if this hierarchy of definition made any difference.</P>
<P>8. Tables and figures<BR/>Where possible, data were entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the treatment depots.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded eleven trials. Five were not randomised. The remaining six (<LINK REF="STD-Angst-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Angst 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bakke-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Bakke 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lindholm-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Lindholm 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rapp-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Rapp 1972</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rapp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rapp 1986</LINK>) were all, potentially, of relevance, but reported no useful data. We contacted these authors requesting raw data but no replies have been received to date.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>No studies are awaiting assessment</P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>No studies are thought to be ongoing.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We identified four studies for inclusion, <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.1 Length of trial<BR/>Three studies <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> were of short term duration (six weeks to five months) and one trial <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> was of medium term duration (six months to one year).</P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>All participants were diagnosed with schizophrenia or some other similar psychotic disorder. Three studies included both men and women and one study <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> included only women. Participants were aged between 18 and 63 years. </P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>The majority of those who participated had long histories of illness. <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> included participants from both hospital and community settings. <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> used hospitalised patients. <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> failed to mention the setting of the study.</P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> was the largest study, randomising 172 people with schizophrenia. <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> randomised 32 people, <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> used 64 people and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> 45 people.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> compared perphenazine enanthate, the shorter acting perphenazine depot, to another depot (clopenthixol decanoate). <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> perphenazine enanthate to flupentixol decanoate. <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> compared perphenazine enanthate to its own longer acting decanoate ester. <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> compared perphenazine enanthate to fluspirilene.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes - reporting<BR/>Only dichotomised data from the Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) was possible to use in this review. All other continuous data were poorly reported and impossible to present. Many of the trials presented their findings in graphs or by p-values alone. Graphical presentation made it impossible to acquire raw data for synthesis. Requests for raw data from authors have so far failed. It was also common to use p-values as a measure of association between intervention and outcomes instead of showing the strength of the association. Other data such as relapse, rates of study attrition, use of use of additional medication and some adverse event incidence rates are possible to present. </P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales: details of scales that provided usable data are shown below. We have given reasons for exclusion of data from other instruments under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' section.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The CGI is a three-item scale commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement. The items are: severity of illness; global improvement and efficacy index. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery.</P>
<P>4.7 Missing outcomes<BR/>None of the studies evaluated hospital/service outcomes, satisfaction with care and economic outcomes.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> described trials as randomised and double blind. <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> described the allocation as 'by chance' and was double blind. None of the trials gave details of the randomisation process. As poor reporting of randomisation has consistently been associated with an overestimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>) all allocation concealment has been rated as 'unclear' or quality 'B'. The results in these trials are likely to be a 30-40% overestimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>All studies were described as 'double blind'. None of the authors who stated a double blind procedure was undertaken reported this being tested. The two questions, one to the participant - "what do you think you have been given?" and one to the rater - "what drug do you think this person was allocated?" would have clarified the situation. It is difficult to say how prone outcomes such as relapse, global improvement, loss to follow up and adverse events are to observation biases. All results, however, must be interpreted with it in mind that such biases have been inadvertently introduced.</P>
<P>3. Follow-up<BR/>All studies presented the numbers lost to follow up but not the reasons for the study attrition. This also reflects poorly on study reporting.</P>
<P>4. Data reporting<BR/>Often studies reported data in the form of graphs or by p-values alone. Standard deviations around the mean score were often not reported.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. PERPHENAZINE ENANTHATE vs OTHER DEPOT ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS <BR/>Three of the four included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK>) compared perphenazine enanthate to another depot anytipyschotic. The studies randomised a total of 249 people.</P>
<P>1.1 Death<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> reported one death occurring in the clopenthixol decanoate group and no difference was found between groups for this outcome (n=172, RR 0.34 CI 0.01 to 8.26). </P>
<P>1.2 Global state<BR/>Medium term CGI data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> found no significant difference in the number of people being rated as 'not having attained a global improvement by six months' (n=172, RR 1.14 CI 0.9 to 1.5). <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> also reported findings for the outcome of requiring additional antipsychotic drugs and although it appears as though fewer people required additional antipsychotics in the clopenthixol decanoate group, the difference was not statistically significant (n=172, RR 1.32 Cl 0.9 to 1.8). <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> presented data for the number of people reported as not improved/worse. Short-term results just favoured perphenazine enanthate with significantly fewer people being reported as 'not improved/worse in this group (n=77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.25 CI 0.06 to 1.0, NNT 6 CI 5 to 29). The same studies reported 'global judgement of tolerability' and results were equivocal with no statistical difference between the perphenazine enanthate and other depot antipsychotic groups(n=77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.26 CI 0.05 to 1.5). </P>
<P>1.3 Mental state: Relapse<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>) reported numbers of relapse. Short -term data from <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> showed no difference between groups (n=32, RR 0.5 CI 0.05 to 4.98) and while medium-term results from <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> appear to favour the control group, the result did not reach statistical significance(n=172, RR 1.31 CI 0.8 to 1.9).</P>
<P>1.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>All three studies presented data for this outcome. Short-term data from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK>) showed no real differences in numbers leaving a study early (n=77, 2RCTs, RR 0.5 CI 0.05 to 4.98). Medium-term results from <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK>, where 38% of participants had left the study early by six months to one year, initially appears to favour the group allocated clopenthixol decanoate but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (n=172, RR 1.3 CI 0.9 to 1.9)</P>
<P>1.5 Adverse effects<BR/>1.5.1 Movement disorders<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> presented data for incidence of movement disorders. Although there was a suggestion that the clopenthixol decanoate group's incidence was less, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (n=172, RR 1.31 CI 0.98 to 1.8). <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> also presented data for use of anticholinergic drugs and found more people in the perphenazine enanthate group required anticholinergic drugs than those allocated to clopenthixol decanoate (n=172, RR 1.12 CI 1.0 to 1.2, NNT 10 CI 8 to 59). It was unclear, however, why these anticholinergic drugs were given. They can be prescribed to prevent or treat cholinergic adverse effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation or to help manage movement disorders. Specific reasons for why the additional use of antiparkinson drugs was required were given by <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> . Results showed that there were no significant differences in antiparkinson use between the perphenazine enanthate and fluphenthixol decanoate groups for either prophylatic use ( n=32, RR 0.5 CI 1.5 to 1.66) or for acute dystonia (n=32, RR 0.5 CI 0.05 to 4.98).</P>
<P>2. PERPHENAZINE ENANTHATE vs LONGER ACTING ESTER-PERPHENAZINE DECANOATE <BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK>) randomised 64 people and compared perphenazine enanthate with perphenazine decanoate.</P>
<P>2.1 Mental state: Relapse<BR/>No difference was seen in relapse rates between the two perphenazine esters by six weeks (n=64, RR 1.33, CI 0.5 to 3.4).</P>
<P>2.2 Leaving the study early<BR/>Although overall loss was fairly high (22% of participants left this short study early), there was no statistically significant difference in attrition between the two groups (n=64, RR 1.33, CI 0.5 to 3.4).</P>
<P>2.3 Adverse effects<BR/>At six weeks more people in the perphenazine enanthate group experienced movement disorder (n=63, RR 1.36, CI 1.1 to 1.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 25) than those allocated the decanoate ester of the same drug. This was supported by finding that significantly more people in the enanthate group required anticholinergic drugs (n=64, RR 1.47, CI 1.1 to 2.0, NNT 4 CI 3 to 22).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. General<BR/>We are led to believe that depot perphenazine is in everyday clinical use in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands. A rough population estimate of these countries totals 54 million, therefore, at a conservative estimate (0.5% lifetime prevalence), a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine. The total number of participants in trials with useful data is 313. We were unable to acquire any studies in this review comparing the effect of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. </P>
<P>2. Generalisability of results<BR/>The diagnoses within these studies were based on Bleuler's criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK>), DSM III (<LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK>), ICD 9 (<LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK>) and ICD 295 <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>. The differences in criteria used may mean that diagnoses are heterogeneous. This is hopefully the case as operational criteria, such as DSM III, excludes many people seen in routine practice. The heterogeneity of diagnosis should increase external validity of the findings of this review. </P>
<P>However, the main benefit of depot formulations is that covert non-compliance is eliminated and if relapse does occur under these circumstances, then non-compliance can be ruled out. As always, those entered into clinical trials are usually reasonably compliant people. This must compromise the applicability of the results into the community, where non-compliance or failure to turn up to depot clinics is commonplace. The four studies employed interesting interventions for comparison but reporting was limited to a few outcomes. Extrapolating the results to outcomes such as social functioning and quality of life would be problematic. </P>
<P>3. PERPHENAZINE ENANTHATE vs OTHER DEPOT ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS (clopenthixol decanoate, flupenthixol decanoate, fluspirilene)</P>
<P>3.1 Global state<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> (n=172, duration six months) compared perphenazine enanthate with another depot (clopenthixol decanoate) and measured global state using the CGI and need for additional antipsychotics. Data appeared to favour clopenthixol decanoate but did not reach statistical significance. It must be remembered that only one trial is included in this comparison, therefore the results need to be interpreted with caution and confirmed by future research. The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK>) also presented data for global state using the outcome 'not improved/worse'. Overall results from these two studies suggested that in the short-term, significantly fewer people in the depot perhenazine enanthate group were worse or not improved (NNT=6) than those in the other depot antipsychotic groups. However, <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> (who randomised perphenazine enanthate with fluspirilene) reported that none of those randomised became worse or did not improve and as such the data is not estimable. The same two studies reported global judgement of tolerability and overall results found no difference in tolerability between those receiving perphenazine enanthate or those receiving another type of depot antipsychotic. Again caution in interpreting these results is needed due to the small sizes (overall n=77) of these studies.</P>
<P>3.2 Mental state: Relapse<BR/>No significant differences in relapse were seen in the short-term. <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> looked at relapse by six months to one year and it seemed as though comparatively more people in the perphenazine enanthate group had, by medium-term, relapsed. However, this difference between the groups was not significant and again results based on one study need to be treated with caution.</P>
<P>3.3 Leaving the study early<BR/> Retention rates were good for <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> (9%) and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> (no drop outs) and no differences in loss were found between groups for the short-term follow-up. In contrast <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> six month study had a much higher rate of attrition (38%) and again it appeared as though more people left early in the perphenazine enanthate group. Why there is such discrepancy in the numbers leaving the study early in these three studies is unclear, although <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> (n=32) and <LINK REF="STD-Tegeler-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tegeler 1979</LINK> (n=55) did randomise smaller numbers of people whilst <LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> randomised 172 people and followed up for six months.</P>
<P>3.4 Adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1980</LINK> presented data for incidence of movement disorders and use of anticholinergic drugs. No significant differences in movement disorders were found, although it did appear as though those receiving clopenthixol decanoate had fewer movement disorders. Supporting this finding was a significant result for use of anticholinergic medication, with less people in the clopenthixol decanoate group needing medication (NNT=10). No specific reason was given for why this medication was needed, as use of anticholinergic drugs is considered indicative of the incidence of adverse effects produced by medication, the perphenazine depot may have a greater propensity to produce these than clopenthixol decanoate. <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> found no difference in antiparkinson use either for prophylatic use or for acute dystonia. Again these are results from single studies only and more research is necessary to confirm such findings.</P>
<P>4. PERPHENAZINE ENANTHATE vs ITS LONGER ACTING ESTER - PERPHENAZINE DECANOATE<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985c" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985c</LINK> (n=64, duration six weeks) compared the two preparations of the same drug. The decanoate ester is the newer of the two and considered to have greater efficacy at lower doses.</P>
<P>4.1 Mental state: relapse<BR/>Whichever form of the depot was chosen, frequency of relapse was not affected.</P>
<P>4.2 Leaving the study early<BR/>Although 22% of participants left this study early, the likelihood of leaving the study early was equivocal between the two groups. </P>
<P>4.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Here a significantly greater incidence of movement disorders (NNT=5) and need for anticholinergic drugs (NNT =4) in the enanthate group suggests that this version of perphenazine depot induces more adverse effects, in the short term, than the decanoate ester although more studies would need to replicate this result.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For clinicians<BR/>Currently no clinically useful trial data has been identified to inform those using depot perphenazine of its advantages or disadvantages over oral medication. Weak data does suggest that the enanthate ester may have more short-term adverse effects than its decanoate equivalent and than clopenthixol decanoate. Whether any of these depots are more beneficial than placebo, oral antipsychotics or other depots should be demonstrated in 'real world' trials (see implications for research). Those using depot perphenazine may feel that clinical practice that rests on such minimal data should be within the confines of a simple randomised trial.</P>
<P>2. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Although the evidence is not strong, if advised to take depot perphenazine those with schizophrenia may wish to receive the decanoate ester to avoid at least short-term adverse effects. No convincing differences are evident when comparing depot perphenazine with other depot formulations, so those prescribed depot perphenazine may wish to exercise choice, or at least be asked to help evaluate different preparations within well designed trials. </P>
<P>3. For managers or policy makers<BR/>No direct data on hospital and services outcomes, satisfaction with care and economics were available. If depot formulations do promote compliance and this leads to a reduction in relapses, this would have important implications for patients and the establishments that care for them. Any suggestion that depot perphenazine reduces relapse and hospital care is not based on trial data.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>If the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) had been anticipated by trialists, much more data would have been available to inform practice. None of the included studies specified the process by which allocation to the intervention group was undertaken. Allocation concealment is essential for the result of a trial to be valid and gives the assurance that selection bias is kept to a minimum. Well described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. It is also important to know how many, and from which groups, people were withdrawn, in order to evaluate exclusion bias. It would have been helpful if authors had presented data in a useful manner which reflects association between intervention and outcome, for example, relative risk, odds-ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If p-values are used, the exact value should be reported.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>This review highlights the need for good, 'real world' clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1995</LINK>) to investigate the effects of using depot perphenazine enanthate and decanoate for those with schizophrenia. No depot compound has been adequately evaluated by modern standards. Few people have been randomised for all but the perphenazine enanthate versus another depot comparisons. Neither depot was compared with placebo or with an oral antipsychotic. More trials for the depot perphenazine esters are needed to assess clinical outcomes, social and cognitive functioning and adverse effects. Future studies should randomise people for whom giving a depot, or not, is a dilemma, in a 'real world' care setting, and report service utilisation data, as well as satisfaction with care and economic outcomes.</P>
