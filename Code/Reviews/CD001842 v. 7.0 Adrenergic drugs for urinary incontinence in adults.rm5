<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Adrenergic drugs for urinary incontinence in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Urinary incontinence is the leakage of urine, and when caused by coughing or exercising it is called stress incontinence. It may be caused by damage to muscles either holding up the bladder or holding the bladder neck closed. Adrenergic agonist drugs may help the bladder neck muscle to contract more strongly. This review of 22 trials involving 673 women and seven different adrenergic drugs found weak evidence that adrenergic agonists may help stress urinary incontinence. Side effects do occur but are usually minor. Rarely, more serious adverse effects such as high blood pressure can occur. More evidence is needed to compare adrenergic drugs with other drugs for stress incontinence and also with pelvic floor muscle exercises. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Adrenergic drugs have been used for the treatment of urinary incontinence. However, they have generally been considered to be ineffective or to have side effects which may limit their clinical use.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of adrenergic agonists in the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 11:25:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 15 September 2010) and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in adults with urinary incontinence which included an adrenergic agonist drug in at least one arm of the trial. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-two eligible randomised trials were identified, of which 11 were crossover trials. The trials included 1099 women with 673 receiving an adrenergic drug (phenylpropanolamine in 11 trials, midodrine in two, norepinephrine in three, clenbuterol in another three, terbutaline in one, eskornade in one and Ro 115-1240 in one). No trials included men. </P>
<P>The limited evidence suggested that an adrenergic agonist drug is better than placebo in reducing the number of pad changes and incontinence episodes, as well as improving subjective symptoms. In two small trials, the drugs also appeared to be better than pelvic floor muscle training, possibly reflecting relative acceptability of the treatments to women but perhaps due to differential withdrawal of women from the trial groups. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the use of higher compared to lower doses of adrenergic agonists nor the relative merits of an adrenergic agonist drug compared with oestrogen, whether used alone or in combination. </P>
<P>Over a quarter of women reported adverse effects. There were similar numbers of adverse effects with adrenergics, placebo or alternative drug treatment. However, when these were due to recognised adrenergic stimulation (insomnia, restlessness and vasomotor stimulation) they were only severe enough to stop treatment in 4% of women. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was weak evidence to suggest that use of an adrenergic agonist was better than placebo treatment. There was not enough evidence to assess the effects of adrenergic agonists when compared to or combined with other treatments. Further larger trials are needed to identify when adrenergics may be useful. Patients using adrenergic agonists may suffer from minor side effects, which sometimes cause them to stop treatment. Rare but serious side effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, have been reported. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 11:26:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Severe urinary incontinence is estimated to affect between 6% and 10% of the adult female population. Stress incontinence accounts for about half of all cases (<LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1980</LINK>). The prevalence of any incontinence increases with age from around 20% to 30% during young adult life, through a broad peak around middle age (30% to 40%) and then a steady increase in the elderly (30% to 50%, <LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2002</LINK>). The prevalence rates of urinary incontinence in men are reported to be about half of those in women (5% to 20%, <LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>In men, urinary incontinence after prostatectomy is a recognised complication. It occurs in 5% to 45% after radical prostatectomy, albeit at varying times after the operation (<LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2002</LINK>). Even after transurethral resection of the prostate, an estimated 11% men use pads initially (<LINK REF="REF-Emberton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emberton 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Types of incontinence<BR/>
</B>Current urodynamic theory suggests that continence is normally maintained by two mechanisms: <BR/>1) the simultaneous transmission of intra-abdominal pressure to both the bladder and the proximal urethra; and<BR/>2) the integrity of the internal urethral sphincter mechanism. </P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) results from failure to maintain the normal retropubic position of the bladder neck and proximal urethra during increases in intra-abdominal pressure and/or when the internal urethral sphincter mechanism is impaired. Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) results from involuntary bladder contractions during bladder filling. Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) is diagnosed when SUI and UUI co-exist. </P>
<P>
<B>Treatment<BR/>
</B>Stress urinary incontinence is conventionally treated with conservative physical therapies and if this is unsuccessful, surgery. Surgical interventions have a cure rate of up to 90%, but on the other hand they also carry risks (<LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2005</LINK>). Such procedures may not be appropriate in all cases and failure rates tend to increase with time. Furthermore, Black et al suggested that the outcome of traditional surgical treatments may be less satisfactory in practice than previously thought, or anticipated, from the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>A variety of pharmacological agents have been investigated for the treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence though few, if any, have become accepted into mainstream practice. As with many other areas of incontinence research, data from randomised controlled trials are scarce. Drug treatment of stress incontinence is generally considered to be ineffective or their use severely limited by side effects such as hypertension, piloerection and central nervous system (CNS) stimulation. As a result, they are rarely used in clinical practice. Despite this pessimism, there is continuing clinical and pharmacological interest in their use. Furthermore, the introduction of a new drug class, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may prove promising and is the subject of a new Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Mariappan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariappan 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>There are two main types of adrenergic drugs, alpha and beta.</P>
<P>
<I>Alpha adrenergics</I>
<BR/>The adrenoceptor subtype mediating contractile responses to noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in the human urethra and bladder neck has been identified pharmacologically as alpha 1A (<LINK REF="REF-Byland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byland 1998</LINK>). In vitro studies on segments of urethra and bladder neck show that alpha 1A-adrenoceptors mediate the smooth muscle contractile response to noradrenaline and related sympathomimetic amines (<LINK REF="REF-Kava-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kava 1998</LINK>). Thus, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor agonist would be expected to promote continence, particularly in mild cases of stress incontinence where residual sphincter function is still present. </P>
<P>The alpha 1A-adrenoceptor is, however, not restricted to the lower urinary tract and is widespread in the cardiovascular system (<LINK REF="REF-Michel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michel 1998</LINK>). Clearly, activity at other alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes, alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptors is unwanted, as is penetration into the CNS or release of endogenous noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves. To a greater or lesser degree, these unwanted actions are exhibited by all alpha adrenergic drugs, such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. It may prove impossible to divorce accompanying cardiovascular sequelae and piloerection from significant and clinically relevant elevations in urethral pressure with an alpha-adrenoceptor selective agonist. Side effects may exceed the beneficial effects on increased urethral pressure and continence. Furthermore, the sympathetic nervous system plays a key homeostatic role in the maintenance of blood pressure, but it may be largely subservient to other factors, such as striated muscle tone, for the provision of urinary continence. </P>
<P>
<I>Beta adrenergics</I>
<BR/>Beta adrenergic drugs have also been used to treat stress urinary incontinence. Experimental studies by Morita showed that, in contrast to the known muscle-relaxing effect of beta adrenergic agonists on detrusor muscle, clenbuterol produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of urethral sphincter muscle. This suggested a role for clenbuterol in the management of urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Morita-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morita 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intrinsic urethral sphincter may not be the most important element in the continence mechanism; the equal transmission of abdominal pressure to the proximal urethra may be of greater consequence (<LINK REF="REF-Enhoring-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enhoring 1961</LINK>). However, in women with prolapse and bladder neck hypermobility this pressure transmission is compromised and the intrinsic sphincter mechanism assumes greater importance (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 1995</LINK>). Conversely, in women with stress incontinence without significant bladder neck hypermobility, it is assumed that a deficiency in the intrinsic sphincter mechanism is present. Hypermobility may be successfully treated by a bladder neck repositioning procedure, but the outcome of surgical treatment when intrinsic sphincter deficiency exists is less predictable. Treatments which augment urethral sphincter function are, therefore, theoretically attractive therapeutic options. In practice, however, the two problems usually co-exist and thus distinguishing between them may not be clinically helpful. </P>
<P>The efficacy of adrenergic agonists in urinary incontinence may vary for a number of reasons. Many of these agents have both peripheral and central effects, cause systemic release of endogenous catecholamines or are non-selective in their receptor activity. Clearly, the issues of unwanted side effects and patient compliance must be addressed, as well as their effects on incontinence. </P>
<P>The wide variety of treatments for urinary incontinence indicates the lack of consensus as to which procedure is the best. Provided that a sufficient number of trials of adequate quality have been conducted, the most reliable evidence is likely to come from consideration of all well-designed randomised controlled trials. Hence, there is a need for an easily accessible, periodically updated, comprehensive systematic review of such trials. This review will help to identify optimal practice and also highlight gaps in the evidence base. The present review assesses adrenergic drugs in the management of urinary incontinence. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of adrenergic agonists in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. </P>
<P>The following comparisons were addressed:</P>
<P>1. adrenergic agonists compared with placebo or no treatment;<BR/>2. adrenergic agonists compared with conservative non-pharmacological therapies; <BR/>3. adrenergic agonist drug therapy compared with surgery; <BR/>4. a higher dose of an adrenergic agonist compared with a lower dose; <BR/>5. one adrenergic agonist compared with another adrenergic agonist;<BR/>6. an adrenergic agonist compared with alternative forms of pharmacotherapy; <BR/>7. adrenergic agonist drug therapy used in combination with another drug compared with the other drug treatment alone; and<BR/>8. adrenergic agonist drug therapy used in combination with another drug compared with adrenergic agonist treatment alone. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-10-04 11:26:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has drawn on the search strategy developed for the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group. Relevant trials were identified from the Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials which is described under the Cochrane Incontinence Group's details in <I>The Cochrane Library (</I>
<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">For more details please see the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the Group&#8217;s module in The Cochrane Library</A>). The register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the register for this review: 15 September 2010. The trials in the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register are also contained in CENTRAL. The terms used to search the Incontinence Group trials register are given below:</P>
<P>(TOPIC.URINE.INCON*)<BR/>AND<BR/>({DESIGN.CCT*} OR {DESIGN.RCT*})<BR/>AND<BR/>({INTVENT.CHEM.DRUG.adrenergic*})<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).</P>
<P>The review authors also searched the reference lists of relevant articles.<BR/>We did not impose any language or other restrictions on any of these searches.<BR/>
</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Reports of studies identified as possibly eligible for the review were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion by the review authors working independently and without prior consideration of the results. At least two review authors assessed the methodological quality using the Incontinence Review Group assessment criteria: quality of random allocation and concealment; description of dropout and withdrawal; analysis by intention to treat; and 'blinding' at treatment and outcome assessment. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third person.</P>
<P>Data extraction was undertaken independently by two review authors and cross-checked. Where data may have been collected but were not reported, further clarification was sought from the researchers. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>). Trial data were considered in relation to the eight main hypotheses. Sub-categories were identified according to the type(s) of drugs being compared. Any difference of opinion related to the data extracted was discussed and resolved with a third person.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>When appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken. For categorical outcomes we related the numbers reporting an outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a relative risk. For continuous variables we used means and standard deviations to derive a weighted mean difference. A fixed effect model was used for calculation of summary statistics (pooled estimates) and 95% confidence intervals. Differences between trials were further investigated when significant heterogeneity was found at the 10% level, or from consideration of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), or appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results. </P>
<P>For crossover trials, and trials where continuous data were reported without measures of dispersion (eg standard deviations), the data were entered into Other Data Tables and comparisons made only on the direction of effect. Crossover trials were identified by the suffix '#'. We were unable to use the generic inverse variance for crossover trials as the necessary data were not reported in the trials. </P>
<P>Studies were excluded from the review if they were neither randomised nor quasi-randomised trials. </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>

<P>The methodology of individual trials is summarised in the table of "Characteristics of Included Studies".</P>
<P>The group allocation methodology was not described in detail in all trials. One trial used an adequate method of concealment of allocation, which was sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Ishiko-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ishiko 2000</LINK>). We have assumed that if the authors stated that a trial was randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled, allocation to groups was adequately concealed, and classed this as A. All of the trials were described as such except for three. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Beisland-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Beisland 1984</LINK>) was described as a randomised, open-comparative trial and the other two gave no details about the method of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Gruneberger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gruneberger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>); all three were classed as B. </P>

<BR/>More adverse effects were reported during active treatment than during placebo (see the table of Characteristics of Included Studies for details, and Comparison 01.08), but this did not reach statistical significance in any of the individual subcategories. However, they were severe enough to cause 23 of 604 (3.8%) women in eleven trials to drop out or discontinue treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ani-1987-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Ani 1987 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ek-1978-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Ek 1978 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gnad-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gnad 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1982-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1982 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kromann-1991-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kromann 1991 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lose-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lose 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Musselman-2004-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Musselman 2004 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weil-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weil 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yasuda-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yasuda 1993</LINK>, see Table of Included Studies for details).

<B>COMPARISON 2: Adrenergic agonists compared with conservative non-pharmacological therapies</B> <B>(Comparison 02)<BR/>
</B>In one trial, a beta-adrenergic drug (clenbuterol) was compared with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) alone and with a combination of the two treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Ishiko-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ishiko 2000</LINK>). In another trial an alpha-adrenergic drug (phenylpropanolamine) was compared with PFMT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>The trial involving clenbuterol was small and so provided only an imprecise estimate of differences in cure rates. The evidence suggested that the women preferred the drug alone (number satisfied with treatment 11of 13 (85%) versus 6 of 19 (32%), RR 2.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.40, Comparison 02.06.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Ishiko-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ishiko 2000</LINK>). In the trial involving phenylpropanolamine, more women reported subjective cure or improvement while using the drug (54 of 75 (72%) versus 42 of 82 (51%) on PFMT, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81, Comparison 02.01.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>); there was also a non-significant trend for fewer incontinence episodes on the drug. More women dropped out from the PFMT group (described as 'failed to adhere to treatment' by the trialists), perhaps suggesting that they found the treatment onerous; they were counted as failures in assessing subjective cure or improvement rates (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>In a sensitivity analysis, varying the assumptions about the dropouts altered the findings: if they were treated as successes (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15), or by using data only from those remaining in the study (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30), there was no longer any evidence of difference between the groups.

<B>Dropouts and adverse effects </B>
<BR/>Only six of the trials failed to mention whether any participants dropped out (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlstrom-1990-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlstrom 1990 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beisland-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Beisland 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collste-1987-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Collste 1987 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fossberg-1983-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Fossberg 1983 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 1990</LINK>). In the remainder, 118 of a total of 913 (12.9%) people dropped out, but this was attributed to adverse effects in only 38 of 118 (32.2%, or 4.2% of the total population). Adverse effects were not reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ek-1980-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Ek 1980 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>). In the remaining 20 trials, 281 adverse effects were reported in 1065 people (26.4%). Of these, 17 of 601 (28%) occurred while on adrenergic treatment, 72 of 305 (23.6%) while on placebo treatment and 39 of 140 (27.9%) in women using alternative drug treatment. No side effects were reported by 19 women undergoing PFMT (<LINK REF="STD-Ishiko-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ishiko 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>) but the numbers who dropped out from PFMT treatment in one trial were high (28 of 82, 34%) (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The eligible trials in this review included comparisons of adrenergic agonists with placebo, oestrogens or pelvic muscle floor training or combinations of these treatments in women. No trials included men. Eleven of the trials tested phenylpropanolamine, two tested midodrine, three tested norepinephrine, three tested clenbuterol, one tested terbutaline and one trial tested a new selective adrenergic drug, Ro 115-1240. The trials used adequate methods of concealment of allocation to groups (assuming that a double-blind design was acceptable) except three which gave insufficient information for this to be assessed. </P>
<P>Of the 22 included trials, eleven were crossover trials, but the data were presented in the reports as if they were from parallel groups. They could not be analysed in RevMan as the appropriate statistics were not available in the trials. They are therefore reported as 'Other Data' only. An important criticism of the crossover trials was that only one trial used a washout period (<LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1982-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1982 #</LINK>), although as the half-life of adrenergic drugs is short this may not be so critical. All the trials were small, with an average of 42 participants per trial and 31 participants treated with an adrenergic drug. Of the nine trials which reported continuous data, only two provided standard deviations. All trials reported dropouts, withdrawals and adverse effects. In addition, most provided participant-reported outcomes such as cure or improvement, but only five reported the objective outcome measure pad test, and only six reported incontinence episodes. None of the trials included measures of general health status or health economics. Dropouts were ignored when there were no systematic differences between the groups. </P>
<P>There was weak evidence to suggest that active treatment with an adrenergic agonist drug is better than placebo in reducing the number of pad changes and incontinence episodes, as well as improving subjective symptoms. However, most trials reported only that symptoms were improved; women rarely achieved complete continence, in contrast to the results of surgery for stress urinary incontinence. There was a lack of evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of dose escalation when treating people with alpha adrenergic agonists. The evidence currently available is insufficient to comment on the relative merits of an alpha adrenergic agonist compared with oestrogen therapy, whether used alone or in combination. There was no information about outcomes after treatment was finished. However, the drug would only be expected to be active during treatment. None of the trials reported on whether women who benefited from treatment continued to take an adrenergic agonist after the trial period: there is no biological reason to suppose that the benefits might persist after stopping treatment.<I> </I>
</P>
<P>Although the effect of adrenergic agonists is at best moderate, they may be useful as an adjunct to other non-pharmacological treatments such as pelvic floor muscle training as suggested by Lehtonen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 1986</LINK>). In the direct comparisons of pelvic floor muscle training with adrenergic drugs, the drugs appeared to have better results than the physical exercises. This, however, depended on the assumption in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1991</LINK>) that the women who dropped out of the pelvic floor muscle training group had failed treatment: data for the women remaining in the trial were inconclusive, as was a sensitivity analysis assuming that the dropouts were cured. The duration of the treatments were also different: 4 weeks of drug treatment were being compared with 6 months of pelvic floor muscle training, which may explain some of the difference in compliance. The trial which compared drug treatment alone with combination treatment was too small to allow conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Ishiko-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ishiko 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects</B>
<BR/>All trials reported adverse effects, although not always according to treatment arm. While it was clear that more adverse effects occurred while participants were on the adrenergic treatment arm (28% in total), this did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo treatment. The majority of the adverse effects were minor and they also occurred during placebo (24%) or comparison (28%) treatment. </P>
<P>Although a total of 118 of 913 (13%) women dropped out, the side effects were characteristic of adrenergic stimulation (insomnia, restlessness and vasomotor symptoms) in only 38 of the 913 (4%). Thus, these symptoms rarely resulted in withdrawal from the trials, suggesting that side effects were not a major issue. However, rare but serious adverse effects have been reported in the literature for adrenergic drugs, including cardiac arrhythmias and severe hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1983</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Dose</B>
<BR/>Most of the trials of phenylpropanolamine used a dose of 50 mg twice a day. Beisland suggested that this was the minimum dose necessary to achieve a plasma level of 150 ng/ml (<LINK REF="STD-Beisland-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Beisland 1984</LINK>). There may therefore be a need for a dose escalation study to assess the benefits of higher doses. The one trial which addressed this issue was too small to be reliable (<LINK REF="STD-Weil-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weil 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures</B>
<BR/>Objective outcome measures such as the weighed pad test and urodynamic detection of urodynamic stress incontinence may reflect the effects these agents have on lower urinary tract physiology and give important information as to their likely clinical effects. However, although urodynamic investigations are undoubtedly useful diagnostic tests, urodynamic parameters per se can only be regarded as surrogate end-points in the assessment of outcome because they have no proven correlation with clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swift-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swift 1995</LINK>).<I> </I>This review, therefore, concentrated on the ultimate goal of curing or improving patients' symptoms and quality of life. </P>
<P>
<B>Urinary incontinence in men after prostate surgery</B>
<BR/>Urinary incontinence is a recognised complication after prostate surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2002</LINK>). Treatment ranges from conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle training (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2004</LINK>), to minimally invasive urethral bulking agent injections (<LINK REF="REF-Pickard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickard 2003</LINK>), to more major surgery such as artificial urinary sphincter insertion. There were no controlled studies on the use of adrenergic agonist drugs for incontinence after prostatectomy, but they might have a place in management. This should be tested by randomised controlled trials. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is some weak evidence in support of adrenergic agonists as effective treatment for incontinence compared with placebo treatment. There was not enough evidence to assess their effectiveness in relation to other treatments. They do have minor side effects, which may sometimes result in stopping treatment. Rare but serious side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension have also been reported in the literature. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Larger trials would strengthen the evidence base for the use of adrenergic drugs for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. In particular, their use needs to be evaluated in comparison with other effective treatments such as surgery and pelvic floor muscle training, and in combination with these alternatives, both in terms of continence and unwanted effects. A randomised controlled trial in men with post-prostatectomy incontinence should be considered. Trials should use standardised outcomes including both subjective and objective measures of cure and improvement, general health status measures, and quality of life and health economic outcomes. </P>
