<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Prostaglandin E1 helps many men suffering from erectile dysfunction to have sexual intercourse</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Men who experience erectile dysfunction (ED) are unable to achieve an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse. One of the most common treatment is with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a naturally occurring PGE used to treat this dysfunction. Men either inject PGE1 into their penis or insert a pellet containing the drug into the end of the penis (into the urethra). The review of trials found that men using PGE1 reported more satisfactory sexual experiences. Higher doses gave greater benefits but also increased the adverse effects. The most common adverse effect is some pain, and men may prefer the urethral medication rather than injections.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Erectile dysfunction (ED), the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity, is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions in men. ED may have a dramatic impact on the quality of life of many men and their partners. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate and summarise the effectiveness and safety of PGE1 in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register (June 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 - June 2003), EMBASE (January 1988 - June 2003) and reference lists of articles. We also undertook handsearching and contacting trialists and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, double blind, randomised controlled trials comparing PGE1 and placebo treatment in participants with ED of different aetiology were considered. Primary outcomes were: (a) patient and partner satisfaction measured by means of a self-assessment; (b) quality of life and (c) safety assessment. Both parallel group and cross-over design trials were considered for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All the reviewers independently selected articles for inclusion, assessed the trials' quality and extracted the data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials involving 1873 participants, heterogeneous with respect to aetiology of ED, were included. Study design was two cross-over and two parallel group trials. Only the latter provided adequate data for meta-analyses. PGE1 was effective during follow-up in the "at least one successful intercourse" outcome (Peto Odds Ratio, OR 7.22, 95% CI. 5.68-9.18) . One cross-over study reported "at least one successful intercourse" in 63.6% of participants with at least one dose of PGE1 (P &lt; 0.01 for each active dose versus placebo). In the other cross-over study, only one of three treatment groups conducted a self-evaluation (55.5%: "good" or "excellent" response). Adverse effects were most frequent in the treated groups and occurred more often and intensely as doses increased. Penile pain (Peto OR 7.39, 95% CI. 5.40-10.12) and minor urethral trauma (Peto OR 3.79, 95% CI. 1.88-7.65) were predominant.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>PGE1 was beneficial for many participants with ED of different aetiology. Adverse effects were proportional to dosage, albeit never serious. The use of PGE1 in ED could have been better interpreted if its effectiveness were compared by aetiology and with different forms of administrations, a longer follow-up were considered and more emphasis given to patient/partner relationships and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-03 11:15:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 11:13:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Erectile dysfunction (ED), defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1993</LINK>) is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions in men. The degree of the dysfunction may range from a partial decrease in penile rigidity or in the ability to sustain an erection to complete erectile failure. ED can undermine self-esteem, interpersonal relationships and other aspects of the patient's and their partner's quality of life (QoL). The psychological repercussions of ED can be more disabling than the associated chronic illness, and may even interfere with the patient's compliance with the primary treatment regimen. Epidemiological data are sparse, but estimates suggest that 20 to 30 million men in the United States and 10% of sexually active men in Germany suffer from chronic disturbances of erection (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1994</LINK>).<BR/>Normal erectile function requires the coordination of psychological, hormonal, neurological, vascular and cavernosal factors. Alteration in any one of these factors may be sufficient to cause erectile dysfunction. Not uncommonly, a combination of factors is involved. Since erectile dysfunction is often accompanied by chronic illness, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension and a variety of neurological diseases, physicians from any number of medical disciplines will see patients with this disorder.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 11:13:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>The discovery that injection of vasoactive agents into the corpora cavernosa induces penile erection marked one of the most dramatic advances in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Indeed, one of the most common treatments is self-administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) either as injection into the corpora cavernosa or as transurethral application. PGE1, also known as alprostadil, is an endogenous substance that has a strong relaxing effect on the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa and on the helicine and cavernous arteries. Both processes are critical in the erectile mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-06-03 11:14:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>PGE1 is a naturally occurring constituent of many mammal tissues and its receptors have also been quantified in the cavernous tissue of men. Moreover, receptor density and binding affinity correlate well with the clinical response to prostaglandin E1, suggesting that this receptor binding may be an initial step in the prostaglandin E1 action on penile erection. Prostaglandin E1 is also rapidly metabolised in cavernous tissue. The most common adverse effects of PGE1 are pain at the administration site or during erection, haematoma/ecchymosis, prolonged erection/priapism and formation of painless penile fibrotic lesions.</P>

<P>Four out of the 23 trials retrieved met the selection criteria. A total of 1873 participants were involved. Of the four, two were parallel group trials (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) and two were cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Colli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Colli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>). Both parallel group trials and one of the cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>) compared transurethral PGE1 with placebo, while the remaining cross-over trial compared PGE1 injected directly into the corpora cavernosa with placebo. We excluded 19 studies after reading the full published papers for the following reasons: six were not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wegner-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wegner 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Willke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McVary-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McVary 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2002</LINK>); in five studies PGE1 was compared versus other drugs and not versus placebo ( <LINK REF="STD-Waldhauser--1988" TYPE="STUDY">Waldhauser 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarosdy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sarosdy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buvat-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buvat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Pineiro-_x0027_98" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Pineiro '98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Earle-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Earle 1990</LINK> ); in four studies the outcomes were not clinical, patient-oriented outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-von-Heyden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">von Heyden 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godschalk-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Godschalk 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linet--1996" TYPE="STUDY">Linet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1998</LINK>); two studies compared only two different types of administration of PGE1(<LINK REF="STD-Shokeir-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shokeir 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shabsigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shabsigh 2000</LINK>); one study compared only different preparations of PGE1 (<LINK REF="STD-Vanderschueren-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderschueren 1995</LINK>) and one was a review not a RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Linet--1994" TYPE="STUDY">Linet 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Padma-Nathan parallel group trial (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>) was a multi-centre study (58 sites in the USA), evaluating a total of 1511 participants and their partners who had been selected according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: ED of a primarily organic origin, a stable, monogamous, heterosexual relationship and unable to have sexual intercourse within the preceding three months. Exclusion criteria: urethral stricture or obstruction, an indwelling urethral catheter, anuria, penile implant or prior penile surgery, sickle cell disease, paraplegia or quadriplegia, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or recent acute myocardial infarction, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism with inadequate testosterone-replacement therapy or markedly abnormal blood chemistry or results of haematological tests, or if they had received any investigational treatment within the preceding 30 days. The mean duration of ED was 51 months (3 to 528). Mean age was 61 years (27 to 84). Partner's mean age was 56 years (22 to 84). Initially, each man self-administered one dose of either 125 or 250 mcg PGE1 transurethrally in the clinic. Doses were selected at random in a double-blind manner. On a subsequent visit, they administered the other dose of the drug. The 287 men who had maximal penile response of 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale with either 125 mcg, or 250 mcg, or both were not given higher doses. One thousand two hundred and twenty four men, whose maximal penile response was less than 4, subsequently self-administered 500 or 1000 mcg PGE1 in a random, double-blind manner and later the other dose, as before. Of these, 709 gave responses of 4 or 5 with one or both doses. The remaining 515 men were dismissed from the study. Nine hundred and ninety six participants (66% of total) who responded to PGE1 were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo groups for the subsequent at-home phase. Of the 996 who continued treatment at home, 116 received either 125 mcg PGE1 or placebo, 171 250 mcg or placebo, 302 500 mcg or placebo and 407 1000 mcg or placebo. Nine hundred and sixty one of the 996 men who continued treatment at home reported the effects of at least one administration of the drug. Eight hundred and seventy three (87.7%) completed the entire three-month treatment period. Among the men who did not complete the study, 27 failed to comply with the study protocol, 26 withdrew due to personal reasons, 23 were lost to follow-up, 15 complained of adverse effects, 13 maintained the treatment was not effective, three had unrelated illnesses and 16 withdrew for other reasons. Of the 961 men who reported the effects of at least one treatment, 461 received PGE1 and 500 received placebo. In clinic, penile responses were evaluated with an Erection Assessment Scale (EAS) where a score of 1 denotes no response, 2 some enlargement, 3 full enlargement (but insufficient rigidity), 4 erection sufficient for intercourse and 5 full rigidity. Scores were assigned by the men and confirmed by the investigators. At home, both the man and his sexual partner made entries in a diary recording penile response, the occurrence of sexual intercourse (vaginal penetration), whether the man reached orgasm and the overall level of comfort rated from "very comfortable" to "very uncomfortable".</P>
<P>The Williams parallel group trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) was conducted at 13 centres in England, France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, where 249 participants with organic ED and their partners were evaluated. The participants were selected according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: a stable, monogamous, heterosexual relationship, both patient's and partner's willingness and fitness to resume sexual activity and inability to achieve an erection sufficient for intercourse, without therapy, during the three months prior to the study. The men entered an open-label, dose escalation phase conducted in clinic and self-administered doses of 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mcg transurethral PGE1. One hundred and fifty nine (64% of total) participants had an erection sufficient for intercourse or full erection on any dose and were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner (1:1) to either their most comfortable effective dose of PGE1 or placebo for home treatment (receiving up to 24 doses of medication or placebo). Mean age 57.3 (25 to 78 years) and partners' mean age 52.7 (24 to 75). Aetiology was vascular disease (29.5%), diabetes (14.4%), hypertension (25.1%), respiratory disorders (5.6%), major surgery or trauma (40.2%), other urogenital disorders (28.3%) and/or other organic disorders (49.6%). Percentages do not total since some participants had more than one illness. The mean duration of ED was 61.5 months (3 to 644 months). 65% received concomitant medications. Of these 159 men, 140 reported an effect with at least one dose and were included in the statistical analysis of effectiveness. One hundred and seventeen (74%) completed the three-month treatment. Of the 42 men (26%) who did not complete the study, 12 were lost to follow-up, five did not comply, five requested discontinuation, four complained of adverse effects, three were erroneously enrolled, three maintained the treatment was not effective and 10 withdrew for other reasons. After each home administration, participants made entries in a diary recording the occurrence of sexual intercourse and any discomfort and adverse effects. In addition, participants and their partners each completed a QoL questionnaire at the end of the three month treatment period. Eleven questions were grouped into three domains addressing "relationship with partner", "personal wellness" and "quality of erection" (<LINK REF="REF-Bergner-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergner 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Hellstrom cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>) was a multi-centre study evaluating 68 participants who self-administered four doses of transurethral PGE1 (125, 250, 500 and 1000 mcg.) and one dose of placebo at home over a two to four-week period. Participants' age: 26.8 to 76.4 years. Mean ED duration: 41 months. The participants were selected according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: a stable, monogamous, marital relationship and inability to achieve a spontaneous erection sufficient for intercourse, without therapy, during the three months prior to the study. Exclusion criteria: urethral stricture, anuria, urethral catheter, prior penile surgery, sickle cell disease, unstable angina, a recent myocardial infarction, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure or recent use of another investigational treatment. Aetiology was vascular disease (47%), surgery/trauma (26.4%), diabetes (14.7%) or other - age, tobacco, alcohol, iatrogenic (11.7%). Outcomes included each couple's ability to have sexual intercourse with each dose, erectile response (EAS), and each couple's measurement of penile length and circumference (for penile volume calculations) and assessment of penile response on a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (VA. S.), where 0 denotes "no effect" and 100 a "rigid" erection.</P>
<P>The Colli multi-centre cross-over study (<LINK REF="STD-Colli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Colli 1994</LINK>) was carried out in Italy evaluating 45 participants in two phases: a double-blind randomised trial with intra cavernous PGE1 versus placebo and an open trial. Participants' age ranged from 18 to 65 years: nine were under 40 years of age, while four were over 60. The participants were selected according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: duration of ED at least six months prior to the trial (10 participants = 1 year, two participants = 10 years). Exclusion criteria: anatomical deformation, sexually-transmitted diseases, poorly controlled diabetes, heavy smoking (&gt; 40 cigarettes per day) and recent onset of a serious illness. Likely aetiology: neurological disorders (4.4%), vascular disease (26.6%), psychopathological disorders (53.3%), diabetes mellitus (24.4%), or in combination (11.1%). During the first phase, each patient randomly received a weekly injection of 5 and 10 mcg PGE1 and placebo. Men who failed to respond to treatment were included in the second open phase and received 20 mcg PGE1. Outcomes included penile response measured by a Rigiscan instrument (rigidity and circumference) and palpation (erection rated as absent, partial or complete), as well as an overall self-evaluation rated on a four-score scale, where 0 denotes no erection, 1 scarce, 2 good and 3 excellent. One patient withdrew after the first injection (10 mcg PGE1), despite a positive response.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Since allocation concealment was not described in any of these randomised studies, the authors were contacted as to the type of randomisation used; however no reply has been forwarded to date. Therefore all four studies were considered category B.<BR/>All the studies included were described as double-blind. No details of the blind method used were reported in the Hellstrom trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>). <BR/>The number of dropouts was:<BR/>123/996 (12.3%) in the Padma-Nathan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>) <BR/>42/159 (26%) in the Williams trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>)<BR/>1/45 (2.2%) in the Colli trial (<LINK REF="STD-Colli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Colli 1994</LINK>) and <BR/>not indicated in the Hellstrom trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>).<BR/>Neither of the cross-over studies mentioned wash-out between the two treatment periods.<BR/>The overall methodological quality of all the studies included was considered unsatisfactory.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-03 11:07:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>This review was based on four RCTs reported in four full-paper articles, two of which were cross-over studies (with a total of 113 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Colli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Colli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>) and two parallel group studies (with a total of 1860 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>). Since the authors failed to report individual data for each treatment and for each period, the results of the two cross-over studies could not be combined together nor with the results of the parallel group studies. Consequently, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis and thus the data are described separately. In the parallel group studies, individual data on the four dosages of PGE1 used were not provided and therefore could not be meta-analysed.</P>
<P>However, the two parallel group studies suggested that PGE1 compared to placebo has a beneficial effect on successful intercourse. Due to the lack of data on the other outcomes, "at least one successful intercourse" was used as the prognostic measure to perform meta-analysis. During three-month home treatment period, sexual intercourse was reported as having occurred at least once by many more men in the PGE1 group than in the placebo group (Peto OR 7.22, 95% CI 5.68 to 9.18). Unfortunately, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis on the "number of successful intercourse/number of PGE1 administration (the unit of analysis is not patient but administration of PGE1) even though, "frequency of intercourse" compared to the "total number of administration" proved to be higher in the treated group compared to the placebo group (390/763 vs 46/611 Willimas 1998,and 2485/4933 vs 454/4346, Padma-Nathan 1997).</P>
<P>While the Padma-Nathan study (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>) requested patients to fill in a diary rating a number of subjective aspects of the treatment as very comfortable, comfortable, neutral, uncomfortable, very uncomfortable during the clinical phase, then together with their partners during the home phase, it failed to include the data on these aspects for the randomised home treatment period.</P>
<P>The QoL questionnaire used in the Williams study (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) showed PGE1-treated participants reporting an improvement in all three domains considered (34% in "relationship with partner", 5% in "personal wellness" and 71% in "quality of erection"), while placebo-treated participants reported a decline in all three (11%, 8% and 1%, respectively) (P &lt; 0.005 for each comparison). Their partners, however, reported an improvement in the "relationship with partner" domain in both groups (35% in the PGE1 group and 12% in the placebo group).</P>
<P>The Hellstrom study (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>) reported that 63.6% of all participants had "at least one successful intercourse" with at least one dose of PGE1, as follows: 39.4% at 125 mcg PGE1, 33.3% at 250 mcg, 40% at 500 mcg, 50% at 1000 mcg and 12.5% on placebo (P &lt; 0.01 for each active dose compared with placebo). Penile response (EAS) was 4 to 5 in 19.7% of participants at 125 mcg PGE1, 30.3% at 250 mcg, 26.7% at 500 mcg, 31.7% at 1000 mcg and 4.8% on placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Significant differences between each PGE1 dose administered and placebo (P &lt; 0.001) were also observed for measurements of volume change, penile response by the 0 to 100 VAS, and duration of response. Conversely, each PGE1 dose was considered significantly less comfortable than placebo as rated by the 0 to 100 VAS (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>The Colli study (<LINK REF="STD-Colli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Colli 1994</LINK>) reported a complete lack of response in the placebo group. 38.6% of participants treated with 5 mcg PGE1 and 55.5% with 10 mcg reported a "complete erection". Unfortunately, the overall self-evaluation was reported only for the 10 mcg PGE1-treated group of which 55.5% of participants rated their response as "good" or "excellent".<BR/>Adverse effects were recorded more frequently in the PGE1 groups. Using the Peto Odds Ratio, penile pain had an OR 7.39, 95% CI 5.40 to 10.12, and minor urethral trauma had an OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.65. Other adverse effects, such as urinary tract infection, prolonged erection/priapism, dizziness and hypotension were seldom.</P>
<P>The occurrence of a number of adverse effects increased as doses increased. Padma-Nathan (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>) reported, albeit only for the in-clinic phase, a greater occurrence of hypotension as doses increased (0.5% at 125 mcg PGE1, 0.7% at 250 mcg, 0.7% at 500 mcg and 2.4% at 1000 mcg). Williams (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) reported that the transurethral administration of PGE1 was associated with a minimal or no discomfort in 83 to 88% of participants which, however, was dose-dependent. Hellstrom (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>) reported a greater frequency of penile pain at higher doses (9.1% at 125 mcg PGE1 up to 18.3% at 1000 mcg; 0% on placebo). Colli does not report dose-associated adverse effects.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 12:06:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>The three factors considered fundamental when evaluating evidence concerning any treatment are: the type of participants, the treatment and the outcome. With reference to the type of participants, our review was originally aimed at determining the effectiveness and risks of PGE1 in participants with ED suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS), however in the very few studies reporting participants with MS, the number of cases was so low that it did not merit consideration as the basis for our review. Since there was a lack of calculable data for a each single underlying illness reported in the studies, an analysis by pathology was not possible. The patients included in the studies are most likely typical of clinical practice given the duration of their dysfunction, their age range and underlying illnesses (neurological, diabetes, vascular, smoking, psychological, etc).</P>
<P>Treatment was administered by injection either into the corpora cavernosa (<LINK REF="STD-Colli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Colli 1994</LINK>) or transurethrally (<LINK REF="STD-Hellstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hellstrom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) in all studies. Each cross-over study considered a different form of administration of PGE1 and the two parallel group studies examined only the transurethral administration. While it is unknown whether these two forms of administration are alike, PGE1 does act on the same anatomical structure suggesting the final effect is identical, thus the main distinction between the two forms of administration could lie in the differing concentrations reaching the target site. These two forms of administration have been compared in two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Sarosdy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sarosdy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shabsigh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shabsigh 2000</LINK>). The former reports that injection into the corpora cavernosa had greater effectiveness for at least one successful intercourse than transurethral administration (87% of patients versus 53%). However, the withdrawal rate was far higher in this group (67% versus 17%), suggesting that transurethral administration is an easier and better accepted method of treatment. Likewise, in the Shabsigh trial injection into the corpora cavernosa was more effective for at least one erection sufficient for intercourse (92.6% versus 61.8%) and reported as better tolerated by patients than transurethral administration, however the number of patients lost to follow-up was high (43/111). Owing to the elevated number of withdrawals in the first trial and those lost to follow-up in the second, we can form no further opinion. In the studies under review, a meta-analysis by dose could not be performed given the lack of relevant individual data. Generally, adverse effect were proportional to the dosage.The most common adverse effect recorded was penile pain (Peto OR 7.39, 95% C I. 5.40 to 10.12), however none of the studies reported cases of penile fibrosis, which is considered in literature as the most serious complication in PGE1 administration. As regards the other proposed outcomes of interest, unfortunately "patient and partner satisfaction" could not be measured due to lack of data nor could "quality of life" be summed as only the Williams trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) considered it as a parameter. On the other hand, appropriate data was provided for an analysis of the adverse effects.</P>
<P>A serious drawback in the two parallel group studies (<LINK REF="STD-Padma_x002d_Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Padma-Nathan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>) was the omission of non responders, during the in-clinic phase, from the study and thus from randomisation. Considering only the responders as eligible for the randomisation and for the analysis can affect the external validity of these studies and therefore the application of the results to general population affected by erectile dysfunction.<BR/>We performed an a priori sensitivity analysis considering patients who were randomised and then either excluded or lost to follow-up as worst outcome events. Again, in the analysis of the "at least one successful intercourse", PGE1 proved to be effective, albeit slightly less significant (Peto OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.21).</P>
<P>A limitation of the cross-over trials was the lack of reference to a wash-out period. While, it is unlikely that there is a carryover effect considering the forms of PGE1 administration used in these trials, a wash-out period would have decreased any risk of this occurring.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-06-03 12:00:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>In all patients with ED, regardless of its aetiology, PGE1 improves the dysfunction. Effectiveness refers to "at least one successful intercourse" and " number of successful intercourse" compared to the "number of administrations" outcomes over a three-month follow-up period. The studies under review indicate that adverse effects are not serious and are proportional to dosage.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Studies on ED comparing different types of underlying causes, such as spinal cord injuries, surgical trauma, inflammatory and ischemic myelopathies, vascular diseases, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and other endocrine dysfunctions and psychiatric illnesses are required. Trials should also be planned for a longer period of time. Outcomes should focus more on patient/partner relationships and quality of life in general. Furthermore, reliable, good quality studies comparing the various forms of PGE1 administration are needed.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF/>
<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>Following the suggestions received from the statistical editor of the MSCRG, the version of this review has been modified compared to the version published in Issue 2, 2004 of the Cochrane Library.<BR/>The event "number of intercourses" is not independent from the "number of PGE1 administration" and the estimated odds ratio of the comparison "number of intercourses/number of PGE1 administration" included in the previous version of this review was not reliable. This comparison has been removed from the present version of the review.</P>
<P>The design of the two parallel studies involved a pre-randomisation phase in which the treatment was administered and only the responders were in the studies. The non-responders were excluded from randomisation and their inclusion in the worst case scenario - as performed in the previous version of this review - could have broken the balance guaranteed by randomisation. The worst case scenario has been removed from the present version of this review.<BR/>
