<P>More research is needed before the use of carnitine for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity can be recommended in clinical practice.<BR/>
<BR/>Apnea of prematurity is a common problem in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care setting (NICU). Recurrent apnoea episodes are correlated with adverse neurological development in this population. Carnitine deficiency has been shown to be associated with apnoea and respiratory failure in infants and in adults. The review authors investigated whether treatment of premature babies with carnitine will help in the reduction or resolution of apnoea episodes, and the need for ventilation. No treatment trials were identified. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-08-20 17:02:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apnea of prematurity is a common problem in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care setting, often delaying their discharge home or transfers to a step down unit. Episodes of apnoea are generally defined as periods during which there is cessation of neonatal breathing activity for greater than 20 seconds or those of less than 20 seconds with associated bradycardia, pallor and/or cyanosis <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1987</LINK>. There are reports that suggest that apneic episodes, particularly 20 seconds or more in duration, are correlated with adverse neurological development <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1999</LINK>.</P>

<P>
<BR/>Carnitine, a quaternary amine synthesized from the amino acid lysine, is essential for the transport of fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes for beta-oxidation metabolism and ketone generation. Deficiency of carnitine leads to a decrease in long chain fatty acids that are available for beta-oxidation, resulting in a decrease in energy production at the muscular level <LINK REF="REF-Borum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borum 1995</LINK> . Congenital deficiencies of enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferase or cytochrome-c-oxidase have been noted to result in lower tissue carnitine stores (<LINK REF="REF-Bertorini-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertorini 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muller_x002d_Hocker-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller-Hocker 1983</LINK>). Such cases present with generalized hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bertorini-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertorini 1980</LINK>) and in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Muller_x002d_Hocker-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller-Hocker 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-20 17:02:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment with carnitine has shown benefit in the respiratory status of ventilator dependent adults, as well as stabilization of respiratory parameters and increased physical performance in adult patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Prockop-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prockop 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dal-Negro-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dal Negro 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dal-Negro-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dal Negro 1988</LINK>). In a case series of infants with apnoea and periodic breathing, a decrease in such episodes was noted following 48 hours of treatment with oral carnitine (<LINK REF="REF-Iafolla-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iafolla 1995a</LINK>). No unique enzyme deficiency was identified among the cases. Similarly, a study of carnitine supplementation in healthy premature infants of &lt; 34 weeks gestation claimed a significant decrease in the frequency of apnoea episodes and early weaning from ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Iafolla-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Iafolla 1995b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>In an autopsy series of neonatal deaths occurring within 24 hours of birth, preterm infants were noted to have lower muscle carnitine reserves compared to term infants; these levels showing a strong positive correlation with advancing gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Shenai-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenai 1984</LINK>). This is postulated to be related to poor tissue uptake from the immaturity of the carnitine biosynthetic pathways rather than any congenital enzyme defects. In addition, reduced placental transfer and reduced intakes from breast milk or conventional parenteral nutrition solutions also contribute to low tissue carnitine levels in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Shenai-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenai 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1985</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-08-20 17:02:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present methylxanthines (aminophylline, theophylline and caffeine) are the mainstay of treatment for this condition, exerting their effect primarily by stimulation of the respiratory centre in the brain. However, there are some concerns with the safety of these compounds. The commonly seen side effects are feeding intolerance and tachycardia, however, these drugs have also been implicated in serious adverse effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and exacerbation of is chemic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Grosfeld-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosfeld 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurston-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurston 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1999</LINK> ). Doxapram is another respiratory stimulant that was historically used when methylxanthine treatment was not sufficient but wider awareness about its side effects such as seizures, liver dysfunction and gastrointestinal irritation (<LINK REF="REF-Milner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milner 1999</LINK>) has practically eliminated its use from neonatology. Given the relative carnitine deficiency state in preterm infants and the biological rationale for its supplementation, it would be worthwhile to investigate systematically the benefits of carnitine. To date, there has been no systematic review to evaluate the role of carnitine in the treatment of apnoea of prematurity.</P>

<P>For the Risk of Bias Table, we planned on evaluating the following issues: </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?  </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>

<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.

<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to note whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. If sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses.

<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data):  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We planned to assess the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We planned to assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: </P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.   </P>

The remaining studies were randomised or quasi-randomised trials of carnitine supplementation in preterm infants (<LINK REF="STD-Bonner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bonner 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coran-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Coran 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helms-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Helms 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melegh-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Melegh 1986</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Pande-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pande 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt_x002d_S-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt-S 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shortland-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shortland 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulkers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sulkers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seong-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Seong 2010</LINK>); however, were excluded as none reported on the outcome of apnoea (published data only) .</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-03 14:41:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no trials of carnitine for treatment of apnoea of prematurity. The three trials where the carnitine was initiated as prophylaxis for apnoea (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Whitfield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crill 2006</LINK>) did not show a statistically significant difference in the frequency of episodes of apnoea, the duration of ventilation or the duration of hospital stay. However, the power of these trials was limited as a small number of patients were enrolled, with very few subjects developing recurrent apnoeas. One of these trials reported decrease in time spent as periodic breathing (<LINK REF="STD-Crill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crill 2006</LINK>) but no such trend noted in the other two trials. Thus the efficacy of carnitine as prophylaxis or treatment for apnoea of prematurity has not been sufficiently evaluated to date.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-15 18:33:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unlikely that we would have missed an important study that could have been included in the review. Our search strategy was broad. Several electronic databases and the abstracts of the last 10 years of scientific meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research were searched, and exhaustive efforts were made to identify unpublished studies. Application of a formal test for publication bias, i.e. a funnel plot, was not possible as there were no eligible studies.</P>
<P>Given the well documented short-term benefits of methylxanthines when used in the primary treatment of apnoea of prematurity and better risk-benefit profile of caffeine as compared to the other agents in this class (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2006</LINK>), the use of methylxanthines has become the standard practice in most neonatal units. Therefore, it will be difficult to conduct a head to head comparative trial between carnitine and methylxanthines, or a placebo control trial with carnitine as primary treatment for recurrent apneas before the institution of methylxanthines. The concerns about the long term serious adverse effects from the use of methylxanthines have not been substantiated following the publication of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>There are also issues relating to the methods used for ascertainment and reporting of the outcome of apnoea in the existing studies. The above quoted trials of carnitine supplementation which reported on the outcome of apnoea, used different methods of continuous objective recording of apnoea, such that a previous systematic review of trials of carnitine as prophylaxis in preterm babies at risk of apnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2004</LINK>) did not consider it appropriate to combine the results for a summary estimate. <LINK REF="STD-Whitfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Whitfield 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Crill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crill 2006</LINK> did not make use of a nasal thermistor probe in their set up and, therefore, likely missed many of the obstructive and mixed apnoea episodes. This is evident from reviewing the results of the individual studies; five to ten times higher apnoea events were recorded in the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK> study as compared to the study by <LINK REF="STD-Whitfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Whitfield 2003</LINK>. In addition, apneas as recorded by the bedside nurse were also reported differently across these trials. None of the studies reported the clinically relevant outcomes of proportion of infants with continuing apneas or the need for ventilation at varying postnatal ages.</P>

<P>More research is needed before the use of carnitine for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity can be recommended in clinical practice. For now its use should be restricted to randomised control trial settings.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-20 17:05:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We think the following research questions may be worth exploring in future trials:<BR/>1. Carnitine as an add-on therapy, versus placebo, for continuing apneas following the use of methylxanthines in premature infants.<BR/>2. Carnitine plus methylxanthine versus methylxanthine alone as primary treatment for recurrent apnoea of prematurity.<BR/>
<BR/>Researchers undertaking the above trials should ensure the use of a nasal thermistor probe for continuous recording of apnoea episodes. In addition, they should include the ascertainment of clinically relevant outcomes: the achievement of an earliest five to seven day apnoea free interval, the proportion of patients with continuing apneic episodes or the need for ventilatory support (CPAP or IPPV) at varying postnatal ages, the duration of ventilation, and the frequency of significant apnoea episodes requiring interventions. The total duration of ventilation should also be documented with developmental and neurological follow-up forming an essential long term goal.</P>
