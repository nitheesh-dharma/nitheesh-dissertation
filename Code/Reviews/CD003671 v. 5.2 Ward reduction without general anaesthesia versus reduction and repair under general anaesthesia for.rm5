<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:28:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ward reduction for newborn infants with gastroschisis is not supported or refuted by evidence from randomised controlled trials. Newborn babies with gastroschisis are born with their gut hanging out of a hole in their belly. If the gut is not put back they could get sick from fluid and heat loss or part of the gut could die or they could get a life-threatening infection. Traditionally the gut is pushed back inside the belly under anaesthetic in the operating theatre but in some hospitals they push the gut back without anaesthetic in the neonatal ward (i.e., ward reduction). It is not known which method gives better outcomes. The reviewers did not identify any randomised studies comparing the two approaches. They concluded that there is no evidence either supporting or refuting ward reduction of gastroschisis.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from RCTs to support or refute the practice of ward reduction for the immediate management of gastroschisis. There is an urgent need for RCTs to compare ward reduction versus reduction under general anaesthesia in infants with gastroschisis. Initial trials would best be limited to those infants with uncomplicated gastroschisis (using pre-defined selection criteria excluding infants that are unstable, have gut perforation, necrosis or atresia, have other organs requiring reduction besides bowel, or are considered to need a silo prior to any reduction). Trials should use adequate pain relief and specify a pre-defined time period after which manual reduction is abandoned.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-16 09:16:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:33:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:32:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastroschisis is a congenital anterior abdominal wall defect with the uncovered abdominal contents protruding through the defect. The defect is immediately lateral to, and usually to the right of, a normal umbilicus. Usually small and large bowel protrude through the defect and occasionally other abdominal organs. Reduction of the abdominal contents is required within hours after birth as the infant is at risk not only of water and heat loss from the exposed bowel, but also, of compromised gut circulation with ischaemia and infarction.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:33:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A newborn infant with gastroschisis will traditionally have the abdominal contents reduced under general anaesthetic in the operating theatre. Surgical repair of gastroschisis usually requires transporting the infant from the neonatal unit to the operating theatre, endotracheal intubation and general anaesthesia, some exploration of the abdomen and its contents, and mechanical ventilation for a variable amount of time. If reduction of the abdominal contents is not possible at the first procedure an artificial pouch, or silo, can be constructed around the gut and attached to the edge of the defect so that it contains the eviscerated abdominal contents. With the silo in place the gut can be reduced over a longer period of time by decreasing the size of the silo.</P>
<P>Recent case series of infants with gastroschisis are summarised in the Table (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Three of the case series describe some of the outcomes for the traditional approach (reduction of the abdominal contents under general anaesthetic) - <LINK REF="REF-Snyder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Driver-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitchanan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitchanan 2000</LINK>. Mortality is around 10%, often related to septicaemia. Only one of the series reports a duration of ventilation, with a median of 4.5 days (<LINK REF="REF-Driver-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 2000</LINK>). Delay in establishing full enteral feeding is usual with median durations of around three to four weeks - total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is required for most of this time. The median duration of hospital stay is around 6 weeks. The need for a silo is common - in up to 30% of cases. Survivors may require more than one surgical procedure and compromised segments of bowel may need to be removed. Other possible complications of gastroschisis include haemodynamic compromise of the lower abdomen, kidneys and lower limbs, gastro-intestinal tract perforation, abdominal scars and/or a cosmetically abnormal umbilicus, late surgery for gut adhesions or scar cosmesis, compromised nutrition, and adverse neurological outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>To avoid the complications of general anaesthetic and mechanical ventilation it has been proposed that the reduction of abdominal contents can be achieved without endotracheal intubation or anaesthesia - usually in the neonatal unit. For the purposes of this review we have defined 'ward reduction' as "manual reduction of the abdominal organs without general anaesthetic and without surgical incision, at the initial attempt to reduce the abdominal contents".</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:33:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first series of patients to undergo ward reduction without anaesthesia was described by Bianchi and Dickson (<LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 1998</LINK>). They questioned the need for general anaesthesia and reported a pilot study in which the infants with gastroschisis were treated with reduction of their gut in the neonatal unit without general anaesthesia, sedation, or analgesia. There were no exclusion criteria, and there was a planned delay of four hours in the reduction as it was felt that the infants were most stable at this time. After the bowel had been returned to the abdominal cavity, the umbilical cord was sutured to the edges of the abdominal wall defect to act as a "plug". The outcomes are summarised in the Table (see additional table 01). After publication of this first case series there was concern voiced by health care professionals regarding Bianchi's technique because of lack of pain control (<LINK REF="REF-Huth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huth 1999</LINK>). Further caution was urged after a report by Dolgin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Dolgin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolgin 2000</LINK>) of four patients who had manual reduction of a gastroschisis. Three of the four cases had significant adverse outcomes with multiple surgical procedures and prolonged hospitalisation. The most recent, and largest, case series was reported by Kimble et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kimble-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimble 2001</LINK>) - see the Table (see additional table 01). Ward reduction was contemplated in infants who met well-defined selection criteria, which excluded infants that were unstable, or had gut perforation, necrosis or atresia. There was no planned delay and no sutures were used. Analgesia with rectal paracetamol was used. During the study period 35 infants with gastroschisis were encountered: manual reduction was attempted in 29 and was successful in 25. Because of the selection criteria the patients undergoing an initial attempt at ward reduction did well with no mortality, shorter time requiring TPN and decreased duration of hospital stay (when compared with the other case series above - <LINK REF="REF-Snyder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Driver-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitchanan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitchanan 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:31:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comparisons between case series are not likely to be valid because of case selection bias. Case series describing outcomes following the traditional approach usually report outcomes on all cases of gastroschisis whereas those reporting ward reduction can be selective and outcomes may differ. Outcomes may also differ if the newborn infant is term or preterm, whether analgesia is used or not, and whether the manual reduction procedure is halted after a pre-defined time period or not.</P>
<P>This review updates the existing review of "Ward reduction without general anaesthesia versus reduction and repair under general anaesthesia for gastroschisis in newborn infants" which was last published in the Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-03-14 15:53:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to assess studies using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. The review authors planned to separately assess each study and add this information to the Characteristics of Included Studies Table.</P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, we planned to evaluate the following issues and enter the information into the Risk of Bias Table:</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We planned to assess the blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We planned to categorize the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  Where needed, we planned to add &#8220;partial&#8221; to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to note whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We planned to categorize the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We planned to assess the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process).

<DISCUSSION>
<P>The technique of ward reduction, without general anaesthesia, for the reduction of the abdominal contents in infants with gastroschisis was first described in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 1998</LINK>). Since 1998 there have been three other case series (<LINK REF="REF-Dolgin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolgin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimble-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimble 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 2002</LINK>) reporting the outcomes for this technique. The main feature that distinguishes the technique of ward reduction from traditional methods is the absence of a general anaesthetic with the attempt at reduction usually taking place in the neonatal unit without the need for any surgical incision or suturing. </P>
<P>This systematic review has failed to determine which approach to the immediate surgical treatment of gastroschisis has the better outcomes, given the lack of any RCTs comparing the two approaches. It may well be beneficial to avoid general anaesthetic and the need for mechanical ventilation; however, it is not known whether this benefit would be accompanied by any disadvantages. Potentially, outcomes such as mortality, incidence of septicaemia, and duration of total parenteral nutrition and intensive care and hospital stay, and gut loss, may be increased or decreased with ward reduction. Comparisons between case series do not allow us to determine which approach would be better with regard to these aspects of gastroschisis management. Case series describing outcomes following the traditional approach usually report outcomes on all cases of gastroschisis whereas those reporting ward reduction can be selective and, if so, outcomes will usually be better. Kimble et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kimble-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimble 2001</LINK>) attempted ward reduction only in infants who met well-defined selection criteria, which excluded infants that were unstable, or had gut perforation, necrosis or atresia. Future RCTs would best be limited to similar infants with uncomplicated gastroschisis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised, controlled trials to support or refute the practice of ward reduction (reduction without anaesthesia and without surgical incision, at the initial attempt to reduce the abdominal contents) for the immediate management of gastroschisis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is an urgent need for randomised, controlled trials to compare ward reduction versus reduction under general anaesthesia in infants with gastroschisis. Initial trials would best be limited to those infants with uncomplicated gastroschisis (using pre-defined selection criteria excluding infants that are unstable, have gut perforation, necrosis or atresia, have other organs requiring reduction besides bowel, or are considered to need a silo prior to any reduction). Trials should use adequate pain relief and specify a pre-defined time period after which manual reduction is abandoned.</P>
