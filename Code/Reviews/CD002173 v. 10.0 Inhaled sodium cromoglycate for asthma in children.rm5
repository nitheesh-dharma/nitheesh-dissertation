I do not agree that you can strongly exclude an effect in the under 4s. The confidence intervals would have to be very narrow to completely exclude a clinically important benefit. I have changed this to &amp;quot;For this subgroup, there is not good evidence that DSCG is more effective than placebo&amp;quot; unless you can present such confidence intervals in this age group. Cogswell has shown significant benefit in the primary outcome for this age group (even though the patients needed previous admission to hospital). The prominent feature of the review is heterogeneity and I agree with you that this generates uncertainty about who might benefit and under what circumstances!&lt;br&gt;The results from your raw data and the GIV analysis in RevMan are very similar but I note that the confidence interval varies slightly for Edmunds making this result just significant! To me this argues that it might be best to leave out detailed examination of which studies achieve a P value of 0.05! I am not sure how you derived rho from this paper, but the paper reports the difference as not being significant.&lt;br&gt;I have inserted the links for the Risk of Bias table and removed the redundant column in the final additional table.&lt;br&gt;Please can you check if you are happy with the amended version, so that we can proceed to peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.10&lt;br&gt;Hans Uijen and Hans van der Wouden&lt;br&gt;Edits August - December 2007&lt;br&gt;See What's new.&lt;br&gt;Several minor edits.&lt;br&gt;Confidence interval (random effects) for Day cough was wrong. Upper limit 0,04 should be -0.04, hence significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3.1&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit June 2007&lt;br&gt;Hans,&lt;br&gt;I have added Forest plots for the outcomes in the table using Generic Inverse Variance. In view of heterogeneity I have set the display to random effects. There is one result that does not match the Table - please recheck this (Day Cough outcome 2) and amend.&lt;br&gt;A more major issue is the interpretation of these results. The tolerance interval relates to a question not usually addressed in our reviews in relation to the likely outcome of future trials. The problem is that these intervals are wider than the pooled confidence intervals shown. The former include the line of no difference and the latter mostly do not. The question of whether the treatment works in patients is currently submerged. The questions need to be clearly separated in the results and discussion. Also the related issues of the statistical significance and size of the effects are currently blurred.&lt;br&gt;I think we have to move on from the conclusion that we do not know if cromoglycate works at all (which is based on tolerance intervals) to the likelihood that is does work in some trials but not others. In this respect I think that the critics of the review have a point. If it is not possible to assess which factors alter the likelihood that the treatment works this can be stated and the reader can look at the data for themselves.&lt;br&gt;Would you like to relook at the update please?&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;See statements in CAPITALS throughout text.&lt;br&gt;These issues need to be resolved before publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine (changed to efficacy in review background and objectives to match the abstract)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: good concise summary of studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: not used (single study by Cogswell to be removed). Data well presented in the additional tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: ****Hans this is too long and needs a single sentence summary at the top. Maximum 25 words for top line and 100 words for the rest! I have shortened it so can you check you are happy with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: DSCG removed and replaced with sodium cromoglycate throughout (abstract should not include abbreviations). &amp;quot;The most recent search was performed in November 2002.&amp;quot; I have copied this from the main text to the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &lt;br&gt;***Outcome of studies: &amp;quot;where a different scale was used it was transformed for our purposes.&amp;quot; What did you do? Transform the mean and SD to be equivalent to the 3 point scale. Could you clarify this please? &lt;br&gt;I am not competent to discuss the meta-regression methods but am prepared to trust the advice from your statistician. *****The funnel plot can now be added as an additional figure in RevMan 4.2 so please can you try and do this?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Although all included studies were reported to be blinded, most papers provided insufficient information to assess the concealment of allocation.&amp;quot; I have removed 'as necessary for placebo controlled studies'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: I have renumbered the tables as requested and changed the links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For day wheeze the picture is very similar, both for the estimate of the difference as for the confidence interval per study (Table 05). The pooled results (random effects) again did not give a significant difference.&amp;quot; Table 5 does indicate a significant difference as zero is not included in the REM confidence interval.&lt;br&gt;****Hans - could you put in the WMD and confidence intervals for the main results that you are describing from the tables (now 3,4, 5 and 18, 19) please, as you have done for the symptom scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(FUNNEL PLOT NOT SHOWN, FORMAT OF DATA MATRIX INCOMPATIBLE WITH REVMAN, CAN BE OBTAINED FROM FIRST AUTHOR OR WAIT FOR NEXT VERSION OF REVMAN (?)) Can you try to put this in as an additional figure now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;Only two secondary outcomes provided some evidence that DSCG may be more effective than placebo but the magnitude of benefit was minimal; a group difference of 0.2 on a scale of 0 to 3 in overall symptom score and of 0.2 dose/day in the use of rescue bronchodilators.&amp;quot; ****I think you need to take day wheeze out of the no difference section and put it in here???? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: *****Conclusions &amp;quot;For mild persistent asthma evidence is only available for children below the age of 4. For this subgroup, there is strong evidence that DSCG is not more effective than placebo.&amp;quot; Is the confidence interval tight enough to exclude significant benefit in this group?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans this is a carefully constructed review of high quality. Could you attend to the final points above and then I will send it out for peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;22_4_3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Inhaled sodium cromoglycate in children with asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris, thanks for your editorial work, keen remarks and kind words&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;below my response to your questions, and attached the funnel plot.&lt;br&gt;As I do not have Revman 4.2 yet, I would like to ask you (or someone else) to finish the last few bits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I can go along with all the changes you made (thanks again), but am a bit unhappy with the Garfield Weston Foundation to be mentioned as source of support. I appreciate their funding of your work, but 99,99% of the work done for the review was done by others. Isn't there another solution for giving them some credit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: ****Hans this is too long and needs a single sentence summary &lt;br&gt;at the top. Maximum 25 words for top line and 100 words for the rest! I &lt;br&gt;have shortened it so can you check you are happy with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes I am happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;***Outcome of studies: &amp;quot;where a different scale was used it was &lt;br&gt;transformed for our purposes.&amp;quot; What did you do? Transform the mean and &lt;br&gt;SD to be equivalent to the 3 point scale. Could you clarify this please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is exactly what we did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*****The funnel plot can now be added as an additional figure in RevMan 4.2 so please &lt;br&gt;can you try and do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have attached the funnel plot as Bitmap file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: I have renumbered the tables as requested and changed the links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think a mistake was made with the last additional table (summary of pooled results). This was and should remain table 20. It is now also present as table 21. The link in the text (Results, first sentence) is now to table 21, should be 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text: in the Results, under heading Symptoms, line 5, &amp;quot;tables 4 to 2&amp;quot; should be &amp;quot;tables for to 19&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For day wheeze the picture is very similar, both for the estimate of &lt;br&gt;the difference as for the confidence interval per study (Table 05). The &lt;br&gt;pooled results (random effects) again did not give a significant &lt;br&gt;difference.&amp;quot; Table 5 does indicate a significant difference as zero is &lt;br&gt;not included in the REM confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are right. This error was caused by a typing error in table 20. In that table, for day wheeze, the upper limit for the confidence interval should be -.03, not .03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please change these two sentences into 'For day wheeze the pooled results show a small but significant difference favouring DSCG: a difference of 0.18 (WMD) on a scale from 0 to 3 (95%CI -.19 to -.03).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;****Hans - could you put in the WMD and confidence intervals for the &lt;br&gt;main results that you are describing from the tables (now 3,4, 5 and 18, &lt;br&gt;19) please, as you have done for the symptom scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please add in Results, under Symptoms: &lt;br&gt;- First paragraph, on proportion of symptomfree days, at end of paragraph: &amp;quot;(WMD 3.57%; 95%CI -2.18 to 15.50 (random effects model)).&lt;br&gt;- Third paragraph on day cough, at end of paragraph, &amp;quot;(WMD -.18, 95%CI -.32 to .04)&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;- Fourth paragraph on daw wheeze: see above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Results, under Use of other medication, change last sentence under this hadding into &amp;quot;The pooled results did not show a signicant difference (OR 0.76, 95%CI 0.34 to 1.72).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Results, under Hospital admittance, at end of last sentence, add (OR 0.93, 95% CI .40 to 2.56).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;Only two secondary outcomes provided some evidence that &lt;br&gt;DSCG may be more effective than placebo but the magnitude of benefit was &lt;br&gt;minimal; a group difference of 0.2 on a scale of 0 to 3 in overall &lt;br&gt;symptom score and of 0.2 dose/day in the use of rescue bronchodilators.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;****I think you need to take day wheeze out of the no difference section &lt;br&gt;and put it in here????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please change into:&lt;br&gt;Only three secondary outcomes provided some evidence that &lt;br&gt;DSCG may be more effective than placebo but the magnitude of benefit was &lt;br&gt;minimal; a group difference of 0.2 on a scale of 0 to 3 for day wheeze and for overall &lt;br&gt;symptom score and of 0.2 dose/day in the use of rescue bronchodilators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: *****Conclusions &amp;quot;For mild persistent asthma &lt;br&gt;evidence is only available for children below the age of 4.

We did not include a table of subgroup analyses. Actually, this would mean a considerable number (28) of additional tables (four outcome measures, seven study characteristics). We believe the way the results of these analyses have been described in 30 lines of text is adequate. I AGREE.&lt;br&gt;ii. corrections were correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;external reviewer:&lt;br&gt;-abstract: suggestions for changing reviewer's conclusions adopted.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-05 12:04:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In this review we aimed to determine whether there is evidence for the effectiveness of inhaled sodium cromoglycate as maintenance treatment in children with chronic asthma. Most of the studies were carried out in small groups of patients. Furthermore, we suspect that not all studies undertaken have been published. The results show that there is insufficient evidence to be sure about the beneficial effect of sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo. However, for several outcome measures the results favoured sodium cromoglycate.</P>

Few studies provided sufficient information to judge the concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the percentage of symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a statistically significant difference between sodium cromoglycate and placebo. For the other pooled outcomes, most of the symptom-related outcomes and bronchodilator use showed statistically significant results, but treatment effects were small. Considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures, a clinically relevant effect of sodium cromoglycate cannot be excluded.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Since the late 1960s, disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) has been used as maintenance treatment for children with moderate asthma, although the precise mechanism of action is still not fully understood. No serious side effects have been reported in trials, but cases of dysuria, urticaria, bronchospasm, angio-oedema and anaphylaxis have been ascribed to the use of DSCG, once with death as a result (<LINK REF="REF-Lester-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lester 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leynadier-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leynadier 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the early 1990s, many guidelines recommended use of DSCG. Gradually, corticosteroids have come to the fore as first choice maintenance therapy (<LINK REF="REF-BAG-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAG 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1996</LINK>), or were recommended alongside DSCG for mild persistent asthma (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1997</LINK>). Other guidelines continued to recommend DSCG as first choice in young children (<LINK REF="REF-Sly-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sly 1997</LINK>). The most recent revisions of the GINA and NIH guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2002</LINK>) consider the role of DSCG in children to be limited. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids are the first choice; DSCG is only recommended as one of the alternative treatment options for children with mild persistent asthma. Canadian guidelines no longer recommend DSCG as maintenance therapy for children, nor do British guidelines for children aged 5 to 12 years (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>, page i20).</P>
<P>The long-term side effects of asthma treatment with inhaled steroids in early childhood are not clear. Nevertheless, there is concern that treating very mild cases of asthma with inhaled steroids may have an adverse effect on the balance between risk and benefit. A Cochrane review has shown an effect of inhaled beclomethasone on linear growth in children (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 1999</LINK>). Therefore, physicians involved in the treatment of asthma in children may still prefer sodium cromoglycate as first choice maintenance treatment.</P>
<P>The use of DSCG has decreased since 1990, while the use of inhaled corticosteroids is increasing. The discrepancy between guidelines and the debate on the role of DSCG, which led to its recent withdrawal as first line maintenance treatment in young children in some countries, was the rationale to review the efficacy of inhaled DSCG as maintenance treatment for chronic childhood asthma.</P>

<P>Two authors extracted data. When using symptom scores, most studies used a scale of 0 to 3 points; where a different scale was used we transformed the mean and standard deviation for our purposes.

A third author determined the final decision if there was lack of consensus. Trials in which one of the authors was involved were also scored by an impartial author. We did not contact authors of the trials for confirmation of methodology and data extraction, because most of the studies were performed many years ago and we considered it unlikely that this would provide further useful information. When updating the review in 2007, a 'Risk of Bias' table was added (Figure 1).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:38:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>If no standard error of the treatment effect of a particular outcome measure was available, and could not be calculated, we imputed it from a study with a similar design (cross-over or parallel) (cf <LINK REF="REF-Follman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follman 1999</LINK>). If more than one study was available for imputation, we selected the largest study, unless this choice would lead to inconsistencies with the results in the original study (e.g. when the authors reported no significant difference, but the imputed data would change this). In that case the second largest study was taken.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:39:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We computed pooled estimates of the treatment effect and the pooled 95% confidence intervals (CI), combining parallel and cross-over studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). For cross-over studies we used the results of paired analyses, extracting treatment effect, standard error and within patient correlation between DSCG and placebo period (rho) from papers. When rho was not given, we imputed this in the same way as stated above for missing standard errors. We tested for homogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Dersimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dersimonian 1986</LINK>). When heterogeneity was found (P &lt; 0.05), we did not use the fixed-effect model to compute a pooled estimate and confidence interval, but only used the random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Dersimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dersimonian 1986</LINK>). To investigate causes for heterogeneity, we evaluated the influence of study characteristics (year of publication, mean age of children, method of delivery, asthma severity of the study population, methodological quality, doses per day and duration). Assessment of asthma severity was based on the description of the study population in the papers (see 'Characteristics of included studies' table). As there was no single outcome measure available for all studies, we selected those outcomes for which at least 10 studies were available. To include as many studies as possible in the funnel plot (see below) and the meta-regression analysis, we combined various outcome measures that used a similar scale, taking the first available from overall symptom score, day wheeze, day cough, day activity and daytime asthma score.</P>
<P>For all study characteristics except asthma severity, we used univariate and multivariate meta-regression analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>), weighing observations by the reciprocal of the square of the standard error of the mean difference between placebo and DSCG. Thus, all pooled outcomes are presented as weighted mean differences (WMD). Study characteristics were either entered as categorical (design, type of delivery) or as continuous (publication year, quality score, etc.). For asthma severity, we used the asthma score in the placebo group (or period) as study characteristic. Because this measurement is subject to measurement error as much as the outcome variables are, ordinary regression analysis is inappropriate, as this technique only assumes measurement error in the outcome variable. Therefore, we used an analysis technique called functional relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Nagelkerke-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagelkerke 1992</LINK>) to evaluate the influence of asthma severity of the study population on the outcome for cough, wheeze and overall symptom score.</P>
<P>We performed all analyses using SPSS version 10 for the initial review. </P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:39:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We performed subgroup analyses when outcome data were available from at least 10 studies, using the following characteristics for subgroup identification: asthma severity (moderate versus severe), health care settings (hospitalised/institutionalised versus other settings), type of delivery (nebulised versus other), age (using a mean age of five years as the cut-off point), duration of follow up (using three months follow up as the cut-off point) and methodological quality (for Jadad's scoring system three points or higher versus lower; for Chalmers' summated items the 13 best studies versus the remaining studies).</P>
<P>To explore heterogeneity further and visualise possible publication bias, we constructed a funnel plot of the effect estimate (delta) against the precision (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1995</LINK>), using the same combination of outcome measures as for meta-regression analysis. The precision of a trial was defined as one divided by the standard error. The symmetry of the funnel plot was tested using a significance level of 0.10 (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Searching the literature databases resulted in retrieval of over 3500 titles (MEDLINE: 1500; EMBASE: 1400; Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register: 850 titles). We read about 200 papers in full; 65 of these were evaluated by two authors according to a structured inclusion criteria form. The final set consisted of 24 papers, reporting on 23 studies. For one study, two papers were published reporting on different outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Yuksel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yuksel 1992</LINK>). Update searches were conducted in November 2006 and October 2007. These identified 181 titles, which were screened, and 10 were obtained as full papers for further assessment. None of these fulfilled our inclusion criteria, but several were added to the list of excluded studies. An updated search in October 2008 did not identify any new studies for consideration in the review. The latest search was in July 2010 and it did not return any eligible studies although two studies were added to <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:39:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Most of the included studies were European (13 studies, nine of which were from the UK) or North American. Two were from Israel, three from Japan and one from Thailand. All but three papers were written in English. One study was in Norwegian (<LINK REF="STD-Dalene-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dalene 1977</LINK>), the other two in Japanese (<LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikawa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mikawa 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies were published between 1970 and 1997. Twelve studies were published in the 1970s, eight studies in the 1980s, and four in the 1990s. Detailed information on each study is given in the table of '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>
<P>The age range of the children in the included studies varied considerably. Eleven studies included children not older than four years of age. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Easton-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Easton 1973</LINK>) the age of the children was not specified. Before 1977, none of the studies included children below the age of four.</P>
<P>Most of the studies had a cross-over design. Four were parallel group studies. The cross-over studies typically were divided into two periods of three or four weeks treatment, with sometimes a washout period in between. In some of the cross-over studies, the first two weeks of each period were ignored in the analysis.</P>
<P>In nine studies the study drugs (DSCG or placebo) were nebulised. Nine studies used dry powder in capsules, most often with the Spinhaler as device, but sometimes without a device being mentioned. In five studies the drugs were administered as aerosols with a spacer and sometimes a facemask.</P>
<P>In several papers it was not clear whether and what concurrent medication was permitted during the trial. We included these studies. Compliance with the therapy regimen was only discussed in a minority of papers.</P>
<P>Most of the studies were carried out in a hospital setting, usually with outpatients. For several studies, no information about the setting could be found. Based on the authors' affiliations, we assumed that these were hospital outpatients. In these cases we have added a question mark after 'hospital outpatients' in the table of study characteristics. Only one study recruited patients in general practice (<LINK REF="STD-Tasche-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tasche 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding asthma severity, most of the studies included children that would be classified as having moderate or severe asthma by current standards (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2005</LINK>). Many children had one or more hospital admissions for asthma in the past. The three studies with probably the largest proportion of mild asthmatic children were <LINK REF="STD-Edmunds-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Edmunds 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Furfaro-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Furfaro 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tasche-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tasche 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>The size of the trials varied between 10 and 232 participants. Only two trials included more than 100 children (<LINK REF="STD-Mikawa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mikawa 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tasche-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tasche 1997</LINK>). As can be expected, the parallel-group trials had larger patient groups than the cross-over trials (parallel group trials had on average 131 participants versus 26 for cross-over studies). Altogether, the 23 studies included 1026 participants.</P>
<P>The length of the period during which the children used either active medication or placebo in the trials varied from three weeks to 26 weeks. For 15 studies (of which 14 had a cross-over design), this was three or four weeks, while only two studies had a duration of over 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Cogswell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cogswell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tasche-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tasche 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several study characteristics were strongly correlated. Dose (corrected for type of delivery), method of delivery, year of publication, age of children and length of treatment period showed Pearson correlations up to 0.75.</P>
<P>The variety of outcome measures on which data were reported was large. Likewise, for most outcome measures only few studies reported comparable data. The outcome measures that were reported most often were asthma scores (10 studies), daytime wheeze scores (10 studies), daytime cough scores (nine studies) and bronchodilator use (10 studies). Several studies reporting on hospital admittance and steroid use provided insufficient information to be included in the pooled results.</P>

<P>The methodological quality, as assessed by two scoring methods, varied considerably (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

The proportion of items fulfilled on Chalmers's list varied between 24 and 79% (mean 44% (SD 11.9)). Of the papers reporting cross-over studies, only few stated explicitly that the sequence of both treatments had been randomised. In the analysis, we assumed they were.</P>
<P>When updating the review in 2007, 'Risk of Bias' tables were produced, and a summary table was added to this review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).

<P>For several items (sequence generation, allocation concealment, selective reporting and other sources of bias), only few studies provided a clear answer. The proportion of question marks (for which the study reports do not provide enough information) is high. Blinding was considered to be adequate for all studies, which is no surprise, as this was an inclusion criterion. Several studies inadequately reported on incomplete outcome data or reported selectively. None of the studies attained the maximum score for 'withdrawals', and 20 of the 23 studies scored less than 50% on this item (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Study outcomes have been gathered into <LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_TABLES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional tables</LINK> 3 to 19 and summarised in Table 20. The tables give pooled point estimates for the difference between DSCG and placebo (i.e. DSCG minus placebo), and confidence intervals, assuming homogeneity (fixed-effect) and heterogeneity (random-effects). Below we report the results for the outcome measures for which a considerable number of studies were available. These study outcomes are now also shown as forest plots for the primary outcome measure and all secondary outcomes with more than five contributing studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Only four studies provided results for the percentage of symptom-free days: our primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In all but one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cogswell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cogswell 1985</LINK>), the confidence interval included the point of no difference. Pooling the results revealed no significant difference between DSCG and placebo (WMD 6.76% favouring DSCG, 95% CI -2.18 to 15.70), random-effects model.</P>
<P>A variety of other symptom and hindrance scores was found. In tables 4 to 19 we present the results for outcome measures for which at least two studies provided data. Here we describe the results for the symptom scores with the largest number of studies: day cough score (nine studies), day wheeze score (10 studies), and overall symptom/severity score (10 studies).</P>
<P>For daytime cough, the difference between placebo and DSCG favoured DSCG in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bertelsen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bertelsen 1986</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The confidence intervals included the point of no difference for seven out of the nine studies. Pooling the results (random-effects model because of heterogeneity) did result in a statistically significant difference between placebo and DSCG favouring DSCG (WMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.04).</P>
<P>For daytime wheeze the pooled results show a small but significant difference favouring DSCG: a difference of -0.11 (WMD) on a scale of 0 to 3 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.03; random-effects model) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mean overall symptom scores favoured DSCG in direction in six out of ten studies (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>). The 95% confidence intervals of four of the studies included the point of no difference. Pooling the results (test of homogeneity rejected, hence random-effects model) showed an overall mean difference of -0.22 symptom score points (WMD), favouring the DSCG group (95%CI -0.34 to -0.09), hence statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Use of other medication</HEADING>
<P>The use of bronchodilators was reported in ten studies (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-17" TYPE="TABLE">Table 17</LINK>). Seven of these reported a difference in favour of DSCG. Five of the studies had confidence intervals excluding the point of no difference. Pooling the data (null hypothesis of homogeneity rejected) resulted in an overall estimated difference of -0.24 daily doses (WMD) favouring the DSCG group (95% CI -0.07 to -0.42, random-effects model), which is statistically significant.</P>
<P>Steroid use in case of exacerbations was also addressed as an outcome measure: systemic or inhaled, or sometimes unspecified. Seven studies provided these data (<LINK REF="TBL-18" TYPE="TABLE">Table 18</LINK>). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Shioda-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Shioda 1970</LINK>) found a significant difference. The pooled results did not show a significant difference (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.72).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hospital admission</HEADING>
<P>Hospital admission was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="TBL-19" TYPE="TABLE">Table 19</LINK>). None of these found a significant difference between DSCG and placebo. Pooling the results of the parallel studies did not result in a significant difference (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.56).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lung function parameters</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies assessed lung function parameters. Eight of these reported no statistically significant difference between DSCG and placebo groups/periods, sometimes without providing exact figures. The variety of parameters, methods used, time of day tests were performed and the way they were presented made it impossible to pool data. Five of the 13 studies reported differences to be statistically significant for one or more lung function parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Geller-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Geller 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hiller-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Hiller 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limburg-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Limburg 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthew-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Matthew 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuksel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yuksel 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies did not report on side effects (<LINK REF="TBL-21" TYPE="TABLE">Table 21</LINK>). The reported side effects of DSCG and placebo in the other 11 studies were mild and of short duration (minutes to a few days). Overall, differences between DCSG and placebo were small.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses were performed for four outcome measures: day time wheeze (10 studies), overall asthma symptom/severity score (10 studies), bronchodilator use (10 studies) and a combination of outcome measures using the same scale (19 studies, see '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>'). For day time wheeze and for bronchodilator use, the differences between subgroups were either not significant or one of the groups contained only one or two studies. For the asthma symptom/severity score, the age of the children and duration of follow up showed statistically significant differences. Studies that included children with a mean age lower than five showed less effect than studies that (also) included older children (estimate of difference between DSCG and placebo -0.06 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.02) versus -0.30 (95% CI -0.49 to -0.11), favouring DSCG, P = 0.03). The three studies that had at least three months follow up showed less effect than the eight shorter studies (0.04 versus 0.27, favouring DSCG, P = 0.01).</P>
<P>The combined outcome measure showed subgroup differences for way of administration of the drug, hospitalisation, age and duration of follow up. Studies that applied nebulised DSCG showed less effect than studies that used other methods of administration (0.08 versus 0.32 on a 0 to 3 point symptom scale, P = 0.01). Studies in hospitalised patients showed less effect than studies in other patients (0.08 versus 0.34, P = 0.01). Subgroup analyses for age and for duration of follow up both showed differences of the same magnitude and in the same direction for the combined outcome measure as reported above for asthma symptom/severity score.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses for the above mentioned four outcome measures were also performed separately for studies with higher methodological quality (see 'Data collection and analysis' for cut-offs). Comparing the results of this subgroup of studies to the overall results revealed only minor differences, in the same direction as in our primary analysis, sometimes more in favour of the subgroup of better quality studies.</P>
<P>The same analyses were done excluding cross-over studies that did not take account of period effects (or did not report they did). For the asthma symptom score (five studies) the pooled difference was -0.06, with 95% CI (-0.16 to 0.03) (random-effects model). For bronchodilator use (four studies) the pooled difference was -0.05 doses (-0.12 to 0.02) (fixed-effect), the random-effects model gave -0.08 (-0.19 to 0.04), all not statistically significant. Both these outcomes are smaller than found for the whole group of studies (see Tables). For the combined outcome measures (see 'Data collection and analysis') nine studies provided data. The mean difference was -0.20, with random-effects, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.09.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Funnel plot</HEADING>
<P>For the funnel plot, showing the mean difference in effect between DSCG and placebo treatment against precision of the study, we could include 19 studies. The symmetry test gave a value of -1.95 for the constant (SE 1.12, P = 0.09), which means that the hypothesis of symmetry was rejected. Especially imprecise (small or heterogeneous) studies with results favouring placebo were under-represented (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-regression analysis and functional relationships</HEADING>
<P>Seven study characteristics showed relationships with the (combined) outcome variable (P &lt; 0.25). As only 19 studies provided data for this combined outcome measure, the power of a meta-regression analysis would be very low. Furthermore, several study characteristics were strongly related to each other (e.g. age, publication year, and method of administration of DSCG). Hence, we decided to refrain from the planned analysis.</P>
<P>There was no influence of placebo symptom level on study outcomes (day cough, day wheeze, overall severity score and bronchodilator use), assessed by means of functional relationships.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-28 18:14:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:39:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This systematic review, involving 1026 children in 23 trials performed between 1970 and 1997, provides conflicting evidence regarding the superiority of DSCG over placebo in children with asthma. There is no evidence to support the superiority of DSCG over placebo in the percentage of symptom-free days, the main outcome of this review, although this is limited by the small number of trials reporting on this outcome.</P>
<P>For several secondary outcomes, especially symptom scores and bronchodilator use, we found significant group differences between DSCG and placebo, favouring DSCG. The overall treatment effect for these outcomes appears to be quite small, with a mean difference of 0.2 to 0.3 symptom score on a scale from 0 to 3 and less than ¼ puff per day for bronchodilator use. However, considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures, a clinically relevant effect of sodium cromoglycate cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>For mild persistent asthma, evidence is only available for children below the age of four. For this subgroup, we can rule out important benefit in terms of symptom scales but not in terms of symptom-free days. We cannot rule out the possibility that DSCG is of benefit in children above the age of four.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:39:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Although DSCG has been advocated as maintenance treatment for mild to moderate asthma, and nowadays only for mild persistent asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2005</LINK>), nearly all trials were hospital based, and included children with moderate to severe asthma. Three studies appear to have included a considerable proportion of children with mild asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Edmunds-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Edmunds 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Furfaro-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Furfaro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tasche-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tasche 1997</LINK>). The study by Edmunds showed positive outcomes on four outcome measures but was methodologically weak. The two other studies had negative conclusions, i.e. DSCG was not more effective than placebo. Both studies were carried out in young children (below the age of four). Studies in children above the age of five found more favourable effects than studies in children below that age.</P>
<P>In nine studies, the drug was administered with a nebuliser. Spinhalers were used in eight studies. Metered dose inhalers with spacer devices, nowadays the preferred method of administration for young children, were used in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tasche-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tasche 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuksel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yuksel 1992</LINK>). The method of administration, a critical factor in delivery of drugs to the lungs, was a predictor of outcome (combined outcome measure): studies that used nebulisation showed less effect than studies that used other methods.</P>
<P>The year of publication of the study and the age of the children turned out to be strongly related. In multivariate analysis, results proved to be instable, sometimes favouring age, sometimes publication year. It is impossible to disentangle these two factors: in the early days of DSCG, studies were carried out in older children and only after 1977 did studies start to include children below the age of four.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-07-28 18:14:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Heterogeneity of study results is apparent for several outcome measures. The methodological quality of the studies, especially regarding sequence generation and concealment of allocation, was often impossible to assess (see 'Risk of Bias' table <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), and varied considerably for other aspects.</P>
<P>The absence of small trials favouring placebo, as shown in the funnel plot, indicates possible publication bias. This bias is likely to result in an overestimation of the efficacy of DSCG, especially because when applying a random-effects model the small positive studies we included received a relatively large weight.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:40:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>It has been questioned whether the (difference in) percentage of symptom-free days should be the primary outcome measure, given the fact that only a minority of studies included this (see <LINK TAG="FEEDBACK" TYPE="SECTION">Feedback</LINK> (Edwards et al)). However, we believe that the choice of primary outcome measure should not be driven by availability, but by clinical relevance. We feel supported by national and international guidelines, where the aim of the treatment of asthma focuses on leading a normal life with few or no complaints.</P>
<P>Lung function parameters could not be aggregated due to incomplete reporting of data.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-27 12:22:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of treatment with DSCG have been reviewed previously. As early as 1974 a narrative review was published in JAMA (<LINK REF="REF-Dykes-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykes 1974</LINK>), based on data provided by the manufacturers, but giving no references to published data. <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK> examined the evidence for the anti-inflammatory action of DSCG in adults and children in a large number of controlled and uncontrolled studies but it is unclear how these were selected. <LINK REF="REF-Hoag-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoag 1991</LINK> summarised studies on the effect of DSCG on bronchial hyperreactivity in adults and children. <LINK REF="REF-Schweitzer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweitzer 1994</LINK> discussed the role of DSCG in children below two years of age and concluded that evidence was lacking; this conclusion was shared by <LINK REF="REF-Carlsen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlsen 1996</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Holgate-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holgate 1996</LINK> reviewed recent trials with metered dose inhalers in children and adults and discussed challenge studies, therapeutic studies, and the long-term effects of DSCG. Other reviews were <LINK REF="REF-Berman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carlsen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Church-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuzemko-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuzemko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Storms-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storms 2005</LINK>. None of the reviews mentioned above were systematic, assessed the methodological quality of studies or tried to quantify treatment effects. With the exception of <LINK REF="REF-Schweitzer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweitzer 1994</LINK>, all of these reviews came to conclusions in favour of DSCG.</P>
<P>Our group published a systematic review of inhaled DSCG as maintenance therapy in children in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Tasche-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tasche 2000</LINK>). The current review differs from the previous one in several respects. Seven studies that were included in the previous review were excluded in this one, either because of different exclusion criteria, especially regarding continuous use of steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Crisp-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Crisp 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miraglia-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Miraglia 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sly-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Sly 1970</LINK>), or because we initially overlooked the fact that the placebo drug contained isoprenaline and hence was not a true placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1968</LINK>). The current review included six studies that were not included in the previous one, because of more thorough searching and the withdrawal of language restrictions (<LINK REF="STD-Easton-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Easton 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalene-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dalene 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikawa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mikawa 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuchinda-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tuchinda 1974</LINK>). Another important difference is that the previous review only considered symptom scores for cough and wheeze as outcome measures. The overall results of the previous and the first version of the current review are similar. For the 2007 update, changing our focus for the pooled results from the tolerance interval to the random-effects model interval has slightly affected the interpretation of our results in favour of DSCG. For this update, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Kraemer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kraemer 1993</LINK>, for reasons mentioned above.</P>
<P>The funnel plot was similar to the one published in our earlier review (for 'wheeze'), although a different outcome was used in order to include as many studies as possible (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). As we have put forward before, when discussing our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Tasche-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tasche 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tasche-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tasche 2001</LINK>), publication bias may be an explanation for the asymmetry. More specifically we think it is possible that small studies that did not find a beneficial effect for DSCG may not have been submitted to journals, or may not have been published.</P>
<P>In order to appreciate the results of this review in the context of other relevant treatments for childhood asthma, we refer to several recently published Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guevara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guevara 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manning-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seddon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seddon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sridhar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sridhar 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The possibility of publication bias could be further explored by trying to obtain information about studies that have been performed but were never published. However, since most studies we traced were published more than 20 years ago, and expecting unpublished studies to be at least as old, this does not appear to be a very promising endeavour.</P>
<P>This review only addressed DSCG as maintenance therapy in childhood asthma. Other studies have investigated the role of DSCG in attenuating exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but we are unaware of a systematic review comparing DSCG to placebo for this condition. Indirect evidence from two systematic reviews in this area suggests that DSCG may be beneficial in both adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spooner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spooner 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:40:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>A considerable number of trials has been performed. Together, they show heterogeneous effects for DSCG compared to placebo as maintenance therapy for childhood asthma. Given the strong indication of publication bias, the small overall treatment effect, and the pooled confidence intervals including zero for our primary outcome measure and several others, we conclude that it is not justified to recommend DSCG as first line maintenance therapy in childhood asthma. This recommendation is further supported by the availability of alternatives with proven effectiveness, i.e. inhaled corticosteroids. For mild persistent asthma evidence is only available for children below the age of four. For this subgroup, there is no good evidence that DSCG is much more effective than placebo. We cannot rule out the possibility that DSCG is of benefit in older children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-14 14:40:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Given the place of DSCG in current guidelines, the lack of studies in children from age four onwards with mild persistent asthma is surprising. A large parallel study in this group, of high methodological quality and extended follow up (at least six months), could fill this gap. Preferably, such a study should not only compare DSCG to placebo, but also contain a study arm with low dose inhaled steroids. As the primary outcome measure we would recommend symptoms, either as a symptom score or as a percentage of symptom-free days. Given ongoing concern about the side effects of inhaled steroids, such a study should also address secondary outcomes like growth, adrenal function and bone density. Leukotriene-modifying drugs would be another class of drugs that could be compared to DSCG.</P>

<P>1. The primary outcome measure, symptom free days is directionally in favour of SCG in 3 of 4 studies. The results are dominated by one study in which we doubt whether the dosage was adequate.<BR/>2. Of the 16 secondary outcome measures, 8 were statistically significant in favour of SCG. None were in favour of placebo.<BR/>3. Of the 17 outcome measures, 11 are to be found in less than 5 studies. Of the 6 outcome measures that included 5 or more studies, 4 are statistically significantly in favour of SCG. None are in favour of placebo.<BR/>4. The presentation of the results is misleading.<BR/>5. Three methods of drug delivery are included with a dose range of 1 mg 3 times daily to 40 mg 3 times daily. No account is taken of the consequences of efficacy on this dose range. There is ample evidence that 2 of the delivery systems, pMDI and nebulization may not provide an adequate dose particularly in children below the age of 5 years.<BR/>6. The diagnosis of asthma is difficult to make with confidence in children below the age of 5 years. At least half the included studies are in children in this age group. Drug delivery also presents problems in this age group.<BR/>7. A number of relevant studies have been excluded. We have identified 16 studies that should have been included. Five were excluded as they apparently included subjects over the age of 17 years. Our examination of the papers shows this either not to be the case or results for subjects below 18 years were presented separately. These studies should have been included. The exclusion of studies due to some children being on regular steroid therapy is not justified in those studies in which the steroid dose was kept fixed. If this exclusion was consistent, 2 further studies should have been excluded. It is doubtful if the exclusion of studies in which a fixed dose of bronchodilator was added to both SCG and placebo treatment arms is justified if this review is considered to be representative of SCG in childhood asthma.</P>

<P>We have replied to most of these criticisms before in response to letters by Edwards et al (2002), commenting on a previous version of our review, published in Thorax. Our conclusions are based on both the fact that the confidence interval that we a priori chose to be our guidance (the tolerance interval) does include 'no effect' for most of the outcome measures as well as the strong suspicion of publication bias, as reflected in the funnel plot. </P>
<P>The fact that the diagnosis of asthma is difficult in young children and drug delivery may pose problems, does not mean that doctors should not treat these children, nor does it mean that investigators should not assess the effectiveness of therapeutic options in this group of children. The protocol of our review was clear in excluding studies that included patients over the age of 17 years. In this update, we excluded the study by Kraemer et al for the reasons suggested by the authors of the criticism.</P>

<P>The current version of the review addresses many concerns which we submitted as a comment previously.  We thank the authors for addressing our comments and producing a clearer presentation of the results of their work.</P>
<P>Our criticisms of this review, the previous review and earlier papers on which they were based relate to the statistical methods used, the presentation of the data the interpretation of the data and the conclusions drawn. A full account of our criticisms can be found in paper by three of us [1]. This was accompanied by two commentaries  by statisticians in the same journal [2,3].</P>
<P>The first Cochrane review concluded that 'The evidence of the efficacy of sodium cromoglicate (DSCG) over placebo is not proven'. In the latest review, the conclusion is 'There is insufficient evidence to be sure about the efficacy of (DSCG) over placebo'. This is a justified shift in stance, but still understates the case for DSCG. Although there was no statistically significant difference between DSCG and placebo on the primary outcome (symptom-free days), seven secondary outcome variables for which data were available in four or more studies were, according to the authors, all in favour of DSCG, and six were statistically significant. Rather than providing 'conflicting evidence regarding the superiority of DSCG over placebo' we believe the review provides overwhelming evidence for the efficacy of DSCG compared to placebo. We do not believe that the authors have fully justified their choice of the primary outcome, given the low power of the of this outcome in that only four studies were included, and one study dominated these results. In one of the commentaries to our paper the author states 'it seems inappropriate to put major emphasis on the meta-analysis of a primary outcome that is reported in very few of the trials' [3] They have also not provided an evidence-based response to the criticism that the dose used in this study was probably inadequate.</P>
<P>The authors claim that there may be publication bias, yet this is only weakly supported by their funnel plots which are potentially subject to criticism as they include different outcome variables.</P>
<P>The size of the overall treatment effect is claimed to be small but should be viewed in the light of the mild symptoms experienced by the children. On-treatment mean symptom scores, where given, were less than one (on a 0-3 scale) in both DSCG and placebo treatment groups. Given the relatively low margin for improvement, the treatment effects seen are indeed relevant.</P>
<P>Based on the above, it is surprising that the authors conclude that 'it is not justified to recommend DSCG as first line therapy in childhood asthma' (the objective was in any case to assess maintenance therapy). The drug has established evidence of safety and efficacy in a wide number of indications, and has a role in both first line and maintenance therapy.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that 'a clinically relevant effect of DSCG cannot be excluded'. We suggest that this review provides strong support for the beneficial effect of DSCG over placebo in childhood asthma, particularly those over four years of age.</P>

<P>We thank Dr Edwards and colleagues for their continued interest in our review. The points raised in their comment are not new, and we have carefully considered these when updating our review. As we have already clarified in previous replies, changing the primary endpoint of our review due to its infrequent availability relative to other measurements in the studies would violate elementary methodological principles.</P>
