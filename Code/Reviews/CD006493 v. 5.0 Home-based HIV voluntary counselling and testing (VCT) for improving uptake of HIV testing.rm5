<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-16 07:42:52 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The HIV/AIDS epidemic remains a significant global health problem, especially in developing countries. The rate of uptake of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is low, and only about one in 10 eligible people have access to VCT in developing countries. Challenges of HIV testing include the difficulty of getting to testing sites and the cost of being tested. Researchers assumed that providing HIV testing or results or both in homes compared to in a healthcare facility would lead to higher uptake of HIV testing. This review attempted to evaluate this assumption. We found only one published study from developing countries and none from developed countries. The only study included in the review showed an increase in VCT uptake after home-based VCT intervention. Because of the limited evidence to date, however, further research is needed to evaluate if home-based VCT is better than facility-based VCT or other testing methods.</P>

<P>The low uptake of HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) has hindered global attempts to prevent new HIV infections and has limited scale-up of HIV care and treatment.

<P>Only one study from developing countries met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. The study, a cluster randomised trial (10 clusters, n=849) compared VCT uptake between an optional location (including home-based) and a local clinic location in a population-based HIV survey. The study showed a higher uptake of VCT among participants in the optional-location group. Uptake was significantly greater in the optional-location group in those who were pre-test counselled only (RR=4.6; 95% CI 3.58 to 5.91); pretest counselled and tested (RR=4.6; 95% CI 3.51 to 5.92); and post-test counselled and received the test result (RR=4.8; 95% CI 3.62 to 6.21).

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-16 14:09:39 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-16 14:08:59 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a collection of signs and symptoms associated with life-threatening immune deficiency, is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a human retrovirus (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 2003</LINK>). Worldwide, about 33 million people are infected with HIV, with over 97% in low- and middle-income countries and 67% in sub-Saharan Africa alone (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2008</LINK>). The virus is a major public health problem in developing countries. Early diagnosis and timely access to care can improve the course of the disease and potentially reduce the rate of transmission. The virus is diagnosed among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Amongst asymptomatic people, HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is the first step to effective HIV/AIDS care and is a central point in HIV prevention in developing and developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-De-Zoysa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Zoysa 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Summers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Summers 2000</LINK>). This intervention is vital in developing countries, particularly in remote areas where delivery of health services is fragmented and laboratory facilities are limited.</P>
<P>Voluntary counselling and testing consists of a pre-test counselling session with a trained counsellor, an HIV antibody test, and a post-test session in which an individual is given results and counselled on reducing HIV-risk behaviours to ensure they remain uninfected (if tested negative) or avoid infecting others (if tested positive). People who test positive also are provided with emotional support, referred to treatment programs, and encouraged to disclose their status to their sexual partners. The target groups for VCT are usually those at high risk of HIV infection; but in countries with generalized epidemics, VCT is aimed at the entire population.</P>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Different models of HIV testing include:</P>
<P>
<B>Mandatory HIV testing: </B>This type of HIV testing is performed without obtaining consent from individuals. The testing was proposed to address HIV among specific populations; for example among pregnant women to prevent HIV transmission to their unborn children. This method of testing has been used in medical circumstances when a patient is unconscious, his or her parent or guardian is absent, or knowledge of the patient's HIV status is essential for optimal treatment. Likewise, testing without consent has been used for sexual offenders, prisoners, and military recruits. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that such testing be conducted only when it is accompanied by counselling for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative people and when HIV-infected persons can be referred to medical and psychosocial services (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>). Where used, the benefits of mandatory testing do not outweigh potential harms when compared to VCT (<LINK REF="REF-Nakchbandi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakchbandi 1998</LINK>). Mandatory testing is not ideal as a public health intervention due to human rights issues. It may cause people to avoid seeking healthcare or being tested and is unlikely to lead to behaviour change. As a result, UNAIDS does not support mandatory testing of individuals (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT): </B>VCT is the recommended method of HIV testing and relies on individuals presenting themselves for testing and giving voluntary informed consent. Several models of VCT are available:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Free-standing services:</B> This model offers VCT at locations away from health services and provides frequent referral of patients to care and support services. It is associated with dedicated staff, flexible working hours, and strong community links. Staff burn-out, however, may limit the availability of services, and HIV/AIDS stigma can restrict client attendance.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Integrated VCT:</B> The service is usually incorporated into existing health settings such as sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, tuberculosis (TB) clinics, family planning services, and mother and child health services. It offers ease of cross-referral and is less costly to operate than free-standing services. This model, however, may not reach certain groups, such as young people and men who normally are unwilling to go to health facilities. Equally, staff may not be committed to the program in the presence of competing interests.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Mobile or community outreaches:</B> This model involves using a van or other mobile means to reach "hard-to-reach" populations. It can improve access, be anonymous, and link to other services, but it can be expensive. It requires considerable resources (equipment, staffing), makes it difficult to ensure follow-up after post-test counselling, and requires extensive community mobilization to guarantee service uptake.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Home-based VCT: </B>This<B> </B>is a door-to-door VCT service that occurs in people's homes (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-TASO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASO 2005</LINK>); <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-TASO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASO 2005</LINK>)). Lay counsellors or community health workers conduct house visits to offer pre-test counselling to the entire household, obtain consent from eligible members, test, and provide results and post-test counselling. This service can be cost-effective, address the needs of the entire family at once, make the discussion on prevention and behavioral change more effective, diminish perceived stigma, and facilitate counselling and disclosure among discordant couples. Alternately, this service is time consuming, family disclosure (parents to children) may be challenging because parents must deal with knowledge of their status first, and testing everyone at the same time may result in premature disclosure and adverse social outcomes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>Routine (or opt-out) testing and counselling (RTC): </B>Testing usually is provided with other tests during a patient's clinical visit, as part of routine medical care. Pre-test counselling is offered in groups, with more emphasis on post-test counselling. Patients refusing the test are considered to have opted out. This model has been implemented in several countries in prevention of mother-to-child transmission, TB, and STI clinics and in medical wards (<LINK REF="REF-Alcorn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alcorn 2006</LINK>). Recently, RTC has been recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as one of the methods to increase rates of early diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>). Although reduced start-up cost is associated with RTC, it has been criticized for removing the "voluntariness" from HIV testing. Following the WHO recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>) for RTC in generalized epidemics where treatment is available, Uganda, for example, continues to implement RTC, starting first with a few research sites (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>) then including more healthcare facilities. From a public health perspective, the primary aim of RTC is to increase the number of people who know their HIV status and to get those who test positive into clinical care sooner (<LINK REF="REF-MOH_x002d_Uganda-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MOH-Uganda 2005</LINK>). In the context of increased access to treatment and care for HIV-infected individuals, the main goal of RTC is to ensure access to clinical care earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Liechty-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liechty 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MOH_x002d_Uganda-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MOH-Uganda 2005</LINK>), and the secondary goal is to prevent HIV transmission and acquisition (<LINK REF="REF-MOH_x002d_Uganda-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MOH-Uganda 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Diagnostic counselling and testing: </B>This method is initiated by a health worker as part of the diagnostic work-up for patients presenting with symptoms or signs attributable to HIV-related diseases. The service aims to assist rapid diagnosis and management. One example is HIV testing for all TB patients as part of their routine management.</P>
<P>
<B>VCT coverage and implementation of various models in resource-limited settings: </B>Voluntary counselling and testing is an effective prevention intervention in resource-constrained countries (<LINK REF="REF-VCT-Efficacy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">VCT Efficacy 2000</LINK>); however, the rate of coverage remains low for many reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Prabhat--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prabhat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coovadia-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coovadia 2000</LINK>). Worldwide, only one in 10 HIV-positive individuals know their status, and the majority in developing countries do not have access to HIV VCT (<LINK REF="REF-Global-Report-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Global Report 2007</LINK>). In one study in Uganda, although 70% of people wanted to be tested, only 15% had been tested (<LINK REF="REF-Kamya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamya 2007</LINK>). Among the reasons for not testing were HIV-related stigma, distance to testing sites (and associated transport costs), and returning to receive results for post-test counselling when rapid testing was not performed (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 2006</LINK>). A national study in Uganda also showed that among 70% of adults who wanted to receive testing only 6% had been tested (<LINK REF="REF-UBOS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UBOS 2001</LINK>). Similarly, nearly 50% of hospitalised patients in Uganda have HIV infection, but HIV testing is rarely available and never routinely offered to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wanyenze-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanyenze 2004</LINK>). Prior to wide availability of rapid testing, those tested in hospitals and other facilities were less likely to return for their results (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fylkesnes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fylkesnes 1999</LINK>). In Zimbabwe, inconvenience of testing location and testing hours were reported as the main reasons for not being tested previously by respondents accessing VCT at a mobile testing site (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Making rapid HIV testing more broadly available and accessible could have a considerable effect on the prevention of HIV infection and uptake of results in developing countries. In southwestern Uganda, an intervention to deliver HIV test results to people in their homes increased the uptake of results from 10% to 37% (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2005</LINK>). Likewise, after the implementation of home-based VCT in Uganda, 5000 people in 2000 homes received VCT over a one-year period. In more than 65% of the homes, at least one family member agreed to participate in testing (<LINK REF="REF-Murana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murana 2005</LINK>). A cohort study in Rakai district in southwestern Uganda also showed an increase in VCT uptake from 35% to 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Matovu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matovu 2002</LINK>). Equally, in Mukono (a rural Ugandan district), one-time delivery of HIV results after community-wide mobilization achieved an uptake of 93% (<LINK REF="REF-Were-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Were 2003</LINK>). In a bid to scale up VCT, Lesotho also has embarked on a nationwide, home-based VCT program (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). By the end of 2007, it was expected that all households would be offered HIV tests through door-to-door VCT services. The impact of this program in getting people into care and changing their sexual behaviour was anticipated to be significant (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Most of the home-based VCT programs targeted family members of HIV-infected persons to initiate care services for HIV-positive individuals and preventive interventions for those with undiagnosed HIV infection. A program in eastern Uganda identified previously undiagnosed HIV infection in 25% of adult family members and recruited 10% of children of index clients into an antiretroviral program (<LINK REF="REF-Mermin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mermin 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Were-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Were 2003</LINK>). In the same location, of the 176 HIV-positive family members tested, 74% had HIV infection and had not been tested previously (<LINK REF="REF-Were-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Were 2006</LINK>). Home-based VCT has many other advantages. In addition to increasing VCT coverage, it may improve HIV prevention efforts, enhance HIV awareness, and provide an entry point to home-based care (<LINK REF="REF-Were-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Were 2006</LINK>).Testing household members increases family diagnosis of HIV infection, and targeting older siblings of index HIV-exposed children can reduce paediatric mortality. In Guyana, testing older siblings of HIV-exposed infants has been implemented and has shown encouraging results (<LINK REF="REF-Guyana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyana 2005</LINK>). Moreover, home-based VCT encourages disclosure of HIV status, reduces depression and anxiety, enhances family adherence and support, and increases risk reduction within HIV-discordant couples. The Ugandan VCT model focusing on home-based counselling at the time people received HIV test results was highly acceptable to the community and also increased the uptake of HIV results compared to facility-based VCT (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Confidentiality of HIV test results at home often is cited as a reason for skepticism about wider implementation of home-based VCT. In one of the Ugandan experiences, confidentiality was not breached when more than 300 individuals were tested. Fears of unfavourable social occurrences after home-based VCT were also proven unfounded when positive social relationships and community support substantially increased three months after enrolment (<LINK REF="REF-Were-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Were 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Gaps and challenges</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>The rate of VCT coverage in many developing countries is low. It is a considerable challenge to get families and couples to attend healthcare facilities for HIV testing. Given the low uptake of facility-based testing and the urgent need to respond to the HIV epidemic, home-based VCT may be an alternative model to increase VCT uptake and coverage in developing countries. Primary studies have evaluated the uptake of VCT in various settings and more recently in the home environment. However, no systematic review has been conducted to establish the most effective method to increase the uptake of HIV testing. Our review assessed the effectiveness of home-based VCT to improve uptake of HIV testing.</P>

<B>Selection of studies</B>
</P>
<P>All studies identified from various sources were read and screened independently by two authors (MB and OA) for eligibility. Differences between the authors were resolved by the third author (SMK) in consultation with the editors of the HIV/AIDS Review Group. Studies were included if they met the inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion of studies were documented. See "Characteristics of excluded studies" and study the flow diagram (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
</P>
<P>The authors (MB, OA) independently extracted data using the pre-designed data extraction forms. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or in consultation with the third author (SMK). Where data were unclear or missing, authors were contacted for additional information. The identified ongoing studies were listed in the table of ongoing studies.<B> </B>(See &#8220;Characteristics of ongoing studies"). The following data were extracted when available (See "Characteristics of included studies"): administrative details (identification, authors, publication status, year the study was conducted); methods (study design, recruitment method, number of participants enroled and recruited and analysed, setting, type of HIV tests and testing site, consent and ethical approval); participants (age, location, socio-economic status, history of previous HIV testing; inclusion and exclusion criteria); intervention (type, duration); outcomes (subjects who accepted counselling and testing); study results (number of participants experiencing the event and the total number in each group for dichotomous outcomes); and notes.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</B>
</P>
<P>The authors (MB and OA) independently evaluated the elements of included trials for risk of bias using a standard form. They included the<B> </B>randomisation method to generate allocation sequence; the adequacy of allocation concealment; blinding (i.e. providers, participants, outcome assessors); incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias.The methodological quality of the selected studies also was assessed independently and classified as "yes," "unclear," or "no" based on the methods described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the editorial policy of the HIV/AIDS Review Group on inclusion and appraisal of experimental and non-experimental (observational) studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2006</LINK>), and with guidance from the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies Methods Group.</P>

<B>Data analysis</B>
</P>
<P>Only one cluster randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 2004</LINK>) was included in the current review. Data were not entered into Review Manager (RevMan) software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) because the authors did not describe if or how they had adjusted for the clustering effect in their study. Likewise, we were unable to determine the cluster size or the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), and we did not have the necessary information to estimate the ICC for the study. Hence, we reported the findings in the text without calculating a relative risk (with 95% confidence interval). The study did not report our secondary outcome of interest.</P>

The study participants are described in the table of included studies. Ten clusters (enumeration areas) representing 44% of all households from a previous survey (<LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 1999</LINK>) were randomly selected and randomised to receive VCT at the "local clinic" (n=1102) or at an "optional location" (n=1343). Later, 442 and 407 subjects from the clusters who were randomised to receive VCT at the local clinic and an optional location, respectively, expressed their willingness to be tested. Subjects from the optional-location group were visited at home by a counsellor and were offered to choose the setting for counselling (home, clinic, or other location). The majority (84%) selected home-based counselling. A day later, they were revisited at home by a counsellor, gave consent, received pre-test counselling, and gave a sample of blood for HIV testing. The next day, a counsellor returned for home post-test counselling. Subjects in the local-clinic location group received both VCT and test results on the same day at a nearby clinic. Blood samples from both groups were tested at the local clinic. Primary outcomes were subjects' readiness to be tested, accepting pre-test counselling, accepting both pre-test counselling and testing, and accepting both post-test counselling and receiving results.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-16 14:09:39 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>The human immunodeficiency virus is a major public health problem in developing countries. Early diagnosis based on HIV testing is a central component of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. Regrettably, VCT uptake in developing countries is poor. Testing can be provided at health facilities, free-standing sites, homes, market places, schools, and other sites. Many developing countries are now placing increased emphasis on home-based HIV VCT as a public health intervention. Massive scale-up of home-based VCT is taking place in Lesotho, Swaziland (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>), and Botswana (<LINK REF="REF-Botswana-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botswana 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiser 2006</LINK>). Uganda and Lesotho have already implemented home-based VCT. In developed countries, such as the United States, widespread promotion of HIV VCT has improved uptake, with nearly 50% of people aged 15-44 years old reporting having had an HIV test. As a result of the implementation of home collection and self-testing (<LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2006</LINK>), the need for home-based VCT implementation may be less (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2005</LINK>) in developed countries. This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of home-based VCT.</P>
<P>There were no published studies of home-based VCT from developed countries and only one published cluster randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 2004</LINK>) from a developing country. This study (<LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 2004</LINK>) was based on acceptability of HIV counselling and testing in urban Zambia. The study showed an increase in uptake of VCT among participants who were offered VCT at an optional testing location (including home-based VCT) away from a healthcare facility when compared to participants who were offered VCT at a healthcare facility. However, the study has limitations. Over 65% (1596) of the total subjects did not agree to testing after randomisation (70% from the optional location group, 60% from the facility group). Data were analysed based on those who expressed willingness to be tested and not with intention to treat. Equally, it was unclear how the authors adjusted for the clustering effect in their analysis. Despite it being requested, the authors did not offer any information about the cluster sizes, and we were unable to establish the ICC in order to adjust for the clustering in the study. As a result, data were not entered into RevMan to calculate the relative risk (and 95% CI) for their primary outcomes. Instead, we reported their findings in text in this review.</P>
<P>There are several limitations with the current review. Only one study was identified and included in the review. The data could not be entered into RevMan due to the abovementioned reasons. We had initially planned to evaluate subject satisfaction levels with quality of VCT received (secondary outcome). However, these data were not reported in the study as an outcome.</P>
<P>Various issues require further research in the context of home-based VCT in developing countries.<B> </B>Home-based testing has many advantages. It circumvents the stigma associated with going for testing, especially to a free-standing VCT site, and it is more likely to lead to detection of undiagnosed HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Were-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Were 2006</LINK>) and to identify discordant couples. Given these advantages, home-based VCT may be an effective way of delivering HIV prevention services in populations not reached by earlier prevention efforts. Testing and receipt of results at home also is associated with more confidentiality than testing and receipt of results in facilities (<LINK REF="STD-Yoder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yoder 2006</LINK>). Although one non-randomised comparative (pre/post evaluation) study (<LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2005</LINK>) not included in the review supported higher uptake of results at home, at present there is no conclusive evidence to indicate that home-based VCT is superior to other HIV VCT models. It also is unclear how the testing behaviours of persons in rural settings differ from or are similar to those in urban areas within home-based VCT. The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 2004</LINK>) was primarily conducted in an urban setting where the socio-demographic characteristics and testing behaviours of participants may be different from those of people residing in rural areas.</P>
<P>Based on the available evidence, the impact of home-based VCT on the uptake of HIV testing is unclear in developing countries. More research is needed to determine the potential impact of home-based VCT on increasing the uptake of HIV testing.</P>
<P>Currently, there are two ongoing randomised studies on the review topic<B> </B>in Uganda (<LINK REF="STD-Charlebois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Charlebois 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jaffar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jaffar 2005</LINK>). Attempts to obtain data from the investigators were unsuccessful. The results from these studies will be included when they become available.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-16 08:32:38 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to limited research conducted to date, there is no strong evidence to indicate the effectiveness of home-based testing for increasing VCT uptake in developing countries. Current sources of data on home-based testing are limited to one study in Zambia, and the study was not methodologically rigorous. Hence, based on the available evidence, we cannot recommend large-scale implementation of home-based VCT in developing countries in preference to other forms of HIV counselling and testing.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-15 18:30:56 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some African countries have already implemented home-based VCT and others are considering it as one of the central elements of their HIV prevention program. However, no systematic evaluation has yet been conducted to assess the effects of home-based testing in comparison to other VCT approaches. There is a need for further research to provide reliable evidence on the beneficial impact of home-based testing on VCT uptake and other HIV prevention-related outcomes in developing countries. Likewise, given the significant cost involved in implementing the program, future studies should examine the cost-effectiveness of the method compared to alternative testing models (routine/opt-out, home self-testing, mobile vans, standard facility). The results from two ongoing studies in Uganda may clarify the beneficial effect of home-based testing.</P>

<P>Cluster randomised study conducted in Chelston, a residential area of Lusaka, Zambia. Using the Zambian census of population mapping system, 24 standard enumeration areas (SEA) in Chelston (2786 households) was established. Ten clusters or SEAs (44% of all households) were selected by probability proportional to the measure of size using the number of households in each area (<LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fylkesnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fylkesnes 2004</LINK>). In the sampled SEAs, all households and members aged &#8805;15 years were listed and contacted. Two thousand four hundred forty-five subjects from 10 clusters (SEAs), aged &#8805;15 years, were randomised. Later, 849 subjects expressed willingness to participate in the study (i.e. to be tested for HIV). The study obtained ethical approval from the National AIDS Research Committee of Zambia. Participants gave informed consent.</P>
