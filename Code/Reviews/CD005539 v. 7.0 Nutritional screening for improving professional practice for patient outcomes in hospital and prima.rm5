<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are often inadequate processes in place to identify patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition in hospitals and in the community. Therefore nutritional screening as a tool for identifying these patients may have an important role in reducing the risks of malnutrition. There are several reports on implementing nutritional screening programmes, but there are associated costs to health systems and patients. It is therefore important to assess the effectiveness of nutritional screening programmes. We searched for studies evaluating the effects of nutritional screening as a main intervention in hospital and primary care settings on patient outcomes such as mortality, illness, health related quality of life, and change in BMI or weight. We also searched for studies evaluating process outcomes like identification of patients requiring nutritional care, data recording (e.g. weight and BMI), or referral of patients to dietitians or similar. Three studies met our inclusion criteria, but they were very dissimilar in their design, setting, intervention and outcomes. One study found that primary care physicians were receptive to the intervention but it did not result in any improvement in detection rate and nutritional intervention rate. Two studies were conducted in hospitals: one reported that patients&#8217; weight documentation increased as a result of the intervention, and the other reported significant weight gains and reduction in hospital acquired infection rate in the intervention hospital. Both of these studies suffered from limitations in their design, and it was not possible to rule out the impact of confounding factors on their findings. As a result, we conclude that evidence on the effectiveness of nutritional screening is insufficient. Therefore, further high quality studies should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of nutritional screening programmes in hospitals and communities.

<P>Randomised controlled studies, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies assessing the effectiveness of nutritional screening were eligible for inclusion in the review. We considered process outcomes (for example patient identification, referral to dietitian) and patient outcomes (for example mortality, change in body mass index (BMI)). Participants were adult patients aged 16 years or over. We included studies conducted in different settings, including hospitals, out-patient clinics, primary care or long term care settings.</P>

<P>After conducting initial searches and screening the titles and abstracts of the identified literature, 77 full text papers were retrieved and read. Ultimately three studies were included. Two controlled before-after studies were conducted in hospital settings (one in the UK and one in the Netherlands) and one cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in a primary care setting (in the USA).</P>
<P>The study conducted in primary care reported that physicians were receptive to the screening intervention, but the intervention did not result in any improvements in the malnutrition detection rate or nutritional intervention rate. The two studies conducted in hospitals had important methodological limitations. One study reported that as a result of the intervention, the recording of patients' weight increased in the intervention wards. No significant changes were observed in the referral rates to dietitians or care at meal time. The third study reported weight gains and a reduction in hospital acquired infection rate in the intervention hospital. They found no significant differences in length of stay, pressure sores, malnutrition and treatment costs per patient between the two hospitals.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:35:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 1997, the Association of Community Health Councils published the report, "Hungry in hospital" (<LINK REF="REF-Achcew-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achcew 1997</LINK>), in which the authors argued that many patients were not receiving the nutritional support they needed. Before that, the King's Fund estimated that adequate nutritional interventions could save a lot of money for the UK National Health Service (NHS) by reducing the length of hospital stay and improving recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1992</LINK>). Similarly, concerns were raised in several countries about the nutritional status of hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Roubenoff-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roubenoff 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corish-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corish 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2002</LINK>). Since then, numerous efforts such as the further development of screening tools and guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Elia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>) have been developed to target under-nutrition of patients and the quality of nutritional support in hospitals and in the community. Despite these efforts, detailed survey studies conducted in the UK demonstrated that malnutrition affected more than one third of adults admitted to hospitals and, more importantly, the prevalence of malnutrition on admission to hospitals increased during the years 2007 to 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-BAPEN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPEN 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BAPEN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPEN 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BAPEN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPEN 2011</LINK>). Globally, the high prevalence of malnutrition on admission to hospital was also widely reported. In Ireland the prevalence was very similar to the UK (<LINK REF="REF-BAPEN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPEN 2011</LINK>) and a survey in Hungary identified that 41% of in-patients were at nutritional risk (<LINK REF="REF-Lelovics-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lelovics 2008</LINK>). A study from Australia reported lower numbers of patients at nutritional risk, 16.5% of adult surgical and medical in-patients (<LINK REF="REF-Frew-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frew 2010</LINK>). Patients' nutritional status in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries was not favourable. A study on nutritional assessment in one hospital in Iran (a middle-income country) showed that approximately 22% of patients were at moderate risk and 31% were at high risk of malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Mirmiran-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirmiran 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Malnutrition is also a common feature in the community and in care homes. A UK nutritional screening survey in care homes in 2010 showed that the malnutrition rates were similar to hospitals. The prevalence of malnutrition was estimated at 37% in England, 31% in Northern Ireland and 45% in Scotland (<LINK REF="REF-BAPEN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPEN 2011</LINK>). Another nutritional screening study of older adults living in 25 care homes in the UK found that approximately 42% of residents were at medium or high risk of malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2011</LINK>). A survey of community dwelling Chinese adults aged 55 years and above living in Singapore showed that about 23% and 5% were at moderate and high risk of malnutrition, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Yap-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yap 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many screening tools have been developed in order to help identify undernourished patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekesa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekesa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2011</LINK>). Routine assessment of weight and height in hospitals, as well as in high risk groups in the community, has been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sizer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sizer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2003</LINK>). Despite these efforts and the publicity, studies suggested that the weight and height of patients were not systematically recorded in hospitals, making it difficult to estimate body mass index (BMI), change in weight and risk of under-nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>). It was also known that the development of many of the suggested nutritional screening tools did not follow defined methodological criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Arrowsmith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrowsmith 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). However, easy to use under-nutrition screening tools are available for use in different settings (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poulia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poulia 2012</LINK>). The use of these screening tools have been recommended for improving the quality of nutritional care in hospitals in the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Kondrup-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondrup 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the prevalence of under-nutrition and a lack of proper nutritional management of patients in hospitals and the community, nutritional screening may play a role in resolving the problem (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2002</LINK>). Nutritional screening could result in early identification of patients who may otherwise have been overlooked (<LINK REF="REF-Elia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2003</LINK>). It may also help establish reliable pathways of care for undernourished patients, which could include provision of support, provision of advice from clinicians, access to dieticians and provision of adequate follow-up. On the other hand, screening programmes can invoke costs to health systems (for example personnel time and treatment costs) and patients (for example because of false negative and false positive results, and from side effects of potential treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-Gigerenzer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gigerenzer 2002</LINK>). It is therefore important to assess the effectiveness of nutritional screening programmes.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:35:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) defined nutritional screening as &#8220;a process to identify an individual who is malnourished or who is at risk of malnutrition to determine if a detailed nutrition assessment is indicated&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2011</LINK>). The purpose of nutrition screening was described by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism as a method "to predict the probability of a better or worse outcome due to nutritional factors, and to determine whether nutritional treatment is likely to influence this" (<LINK REF="REF-Kondrup-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondrup 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nutritional screening is a rapid and simple way of identifying patients at nutritional risk. Screening can be performed by busy nurses and other medical staff or other relevant professionals at the community or hospital, and normally involves quantitative and qualitative assessment of current weight and height, food and fluid intake, and duration of health status.</P>
<P>There are clear distinctions between nutritional screening and nutritional assessment. In nutritional assessment, the intervention is aimed at establishing whether a patient or individual is malnourished, or at risk of becoming malnourished (that is making a diagnosis), and deciding upon the best courses of action to alleviate nutritional risks (that is providing care). Nutritional assessment may follow nutritional screening. Nutrition assessment involves a more detailed assessment including an examination of functional, nutritional and metabolic variables, and is usually performed by a dietitian, an expert clinician, or a nutritional nurse and can result in a care plan for malnourished patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kondrup-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondrup 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this review, nutritional screening is the application of a screening tool to a group of patients or apparently healthy individuals for whom the level of malnutrition risk is unknown, and is carried out in order to establish the level of risk.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2013-05-28 13:29:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Randomised controlled studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs), clustered randomised controlled trials, (randomised) controlled cross-over designs, block randomised designs (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>)), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time series studies and controlled before-after studies were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>Blinding was not considered essential since it is virtually impossible to undertake in screening studies. Studies with historical controls only (without concurrent controls) were excluded. Although controlled before-after studies without random allocation were considered eligible for inclusion in the review, their limitations were specifically noted as the nutritional screening interventions might be linked to other quality improvement initiatives or contextual issues that interact with effectiveness of the interventions.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:22:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies conducted in different settings including acute hospitals, long term care institutions, community and primary care. Participants were adult patients aged 16 years or over, in hospital, an out-patient clinic, primary care or long term care, and also individuals that were otherwise considered healthy but might be at risk of under-nutrition. The definition of the latter group may differ but includes, for example, elderly people etc.</P>
<P>There was no restriction in terms of gender or the underlying health status of the participants (given this is the evaluation of the screening programmes). However, these variations were taken into account in the interpretation of the findings.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:23:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention ('screening programme') is loosely defined as the application of a screening tool on a group of patients, or otherwise healthy people, for whom the level of under-nutrition risk is unknown to establish whether they are at under-nutrition risk. Nutritional screening is different from nutritional assessment. The latter is usually more comprehensive and includes a more detailed assessment of patients who are likely to be malnourished. Nutritional assessments usually result in the establishment of levels of malnourishment and nutritional risk, and identification of clinical interventions to tackle those risks. In contrast, nutritional screening for under-nutrition targets patients for whom the risk of under-nutrition is unknown and usually involves the application of simpler tools. In practice, however, the line between the two is blurred and consequently special scrutiny of potentially included studies was required.</P>
<P>The intervention could be offered as a stand-alone intervention or as part of a wider strategy. For example, it may be part of a wider strategy for quality improvement in which nutritional screening is one part. The intervention may also be offered as part of a more comprehensive screening package in which screening is being conducted for a few ailments. In the latter forms, the included studies should report outcomes that can be related to a nutritional screening programme. To be eligible for inclusion in this review, the intervention should be compared with a control group that does not receive the same screening intervention. In the case of potential time series studies, the 'pre' intervention period should not involve the screening intervention. Hence if the studies offer a similar nutritional screening programme to both the intervention and control groups, they will not meet the inclusion criteria even if the additional elements of the programme vary between the intervention and control groups.</P>

<P>Titles of all retrieved studies were checked by one review author to exclude those titles irrelevant to the review, and were checked again by another review author (SM). The abstracts of all the remaining titles were sought and independently assessed by two review authors (AHO, YV). The full-texts of the papers were ordered if both review authors felt the studies were potentially relevant to the review according to the defined criteria. If only one review author considered the abstract as relevant, the view of a third review author was sought (SM). The full-text of all obtained studies was independently assessed by two review authors against the inclusion criteria (AHO, YV). Disagreements were all resolved by discussion and by using the views of a third review author, where necessary (SM or AR).</P>
<P>Three review authors independently extracted the data from the included studies (YV, SM, AHO), and these were discussed with another review author (AR). Data about the intervention and control groups, setting, patient or participant characteristics, length of follow-up, and outcome measures were extracted. Any further data that might help the interpretation of the findings were also extracted.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by two review authors (YV, SM) and reviewed by two other review authors (AHO, AR). Quality assessments followed the approaches recommended by the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) and Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Review Groups. Any potential sources of bias in the included studies were recorded and the implication of those biases for the reported outcomes were elaborated upon. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pre-planned subgroup analyses were: within different settings (for example hospital versus primary care); according to the definitions used for the establishment of malnutrition in the population (for example different nutritional screening tools or cut-off points); and the prior probability of risk in the screened population (for example if certain wards are screened versus screening the whole hospital).</P>
<P>The results of each study were reported as point estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where possible. We had planned to conduct meta-analyses if the studies provided similar outcomes and were not heterogenous. Potential sources of heterogeneity were elaborated on. Only two included studies were conducted in similar settings (that is hospitals), but they did not provide shared relevant outcomes. The third study was conducted in primary care. Hence quantitative synthesis was not possible.</P>
<P>As quantitative synthesis was not possible, the data were synthesised using narrative approaches. Two review authors independently synthesised the findings (AR, AHO), and the results were presented to the two other review authors (SM, YV). We presented the findings of the analyses using the Cochrane Collaboration's software RevMan 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>), and we discussed the results and elaborated on potential interpretations of the findings.</P>

<P>Three primary studies were considered eligible for inclusion (See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The first study, a cluster randomised trial, was conducted in a US primary care setting (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>). The intervention practices offered screening for eight ailments (including malnutrition) to patients older than 70 years on their first visit to the practices. The study addressed the following relevant outcomes: health status, nutritional problems detection rates, and interventions if nutritional risks were identified.</P>
<P>The other two studies were conducted in hospitals. One UK controlled before-after study offered nutritional screening to patients admitted to one hospital ward and used another ward as the control (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 2003</LINK>). The control ward received usual care. The mean age of the hospitalised patients was 67 years. The reported outcomes were the nursing documentation process, patient care at mealtime, and frequency of referral to a dietitian.</P>
<P>The third study was conducted in two hospitals in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Rypkema-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rypkema 2003</LINK>). The intervention was screening patients older than 60 years for malnutrition, dysphagia and dehydration followed by immediate treatment, including menu modification or supplements. The intervention was offered in one hospital and the other hospital acted as the control.  The study outcomes included length of stay, weight change, more than 3% weight loss, pressure sores, nosocomial infection, and total cost of treatment.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK> study, a cluster randomised trial, reported that the participating primary care physicians were receptive to the intervention; but the intervention did not result in any significant improvement in general health status as measured by the SF-36 (changing from 57 to 70 and from 61 to 69 out of 100 in the control and intervention groups, respectively), nutritional detection rate (5% versus 5%; 95% CI -1 to 1), and nutritional intervention rate (4% versus 4%; 95% CI -4 to 4). However, the study was underpowered and there were concerns about the quality of the nutritional screening tool used in the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 2003</LINK>, a controlled before-after study, suggested that the usage of the Nursing Nutritional Screening Tool improved the documentation processes of nutrition related issues. As a result of the intervention, patients&#8217; weight recording in the intervention wards increased from 26% to 72% while it decreased in the control wards (P &lt; 0.001). The study observed no change in mealtime observation for the &#8216;at risk&#8217; patients, and referrals to the dietitians decreased in both the intervention and control wards (5.8% decrease in the intervention group versus 8% decrease in the control group). The study did not report patient outcomes.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rypkema-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rypkema 2003</LINK>, a controlled trial which also incorporated a cost-consequence study, reported weight gains (mean weight change: 0.92 kg increase in the intervention group versus 0.76 kg decrease in the control group; P &lt; 0.001) and a reduction in the hospital acquired infection rate in the intervention hospital compared to the control hospital (33/140 versus 58/158; P = 0.01). It observed no significant changes in pressure ulcer rates and length of hospital stay. The study concluded that targeted nutritional screening improved quality of care for older patients and did not increase the hospital costs significantly.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:33:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, only three studies met our inclusion criteria. All of the included studies had limitations in their design. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1997</LINK>) was an RCT, involving 26 primary care centres. Two other studies did not conduct any random allocation, one (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 2003</LINK>) involved one control and one intervention ward and the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Rypkema-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rypkema 2003</LINK>) involved one control and one intervention hospital. Both latter studies had methodological limitations. The three studies were different in design, participants, outcomes and settings. Due to their heterogeneity, no quantitative analysis was possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Also, narrative analysis showed that nutritional screening had no effect on several reported outcomes. Nutritional problem detection rate, the rate of intervention as a result of detection, general health status, mealtime observation for the &#8216;at risk&#8217; patient, appropriate dietitian referrals, length of stay and the pressure ulcer rate did not change following the nutritional screening in the included studies. The two non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rypkema-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rypkema 2003</LINK>) reported improvements for certain outcomes: nutrition related issues documentation (in one study), weight gain and hospital acquired infection rate (in another study). There was no common outcome reported by the included studies, and none of the studies originated from a low- or middle-income country.</P>
<P>As such, the available evidence is not adequate for making an informed judgment about the effectiveness of nutritional screening. There are, however, lower quality or indirectly relevant studies that have addressed nutritional screening, including studies focused on nutritional screening tools, studies that have focused on nutritional interventions after an initial screening, and lower quality studies of nutritional screening. Such studies, despite their limitations in making the link between nutritional screening and patient outcomes, might influence the decision making while robust evidence is still lacking. These studies could not be included because they did not meet the inclusion criteria of the review. We provide examples of such studies.</P>
<P>In recent years several studies have been conducted on the development of screening tools for assessing nutritional status. <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK> provided a concise summary of several studies of nutritional screening tools and reported on easy to administer nutritional screening tools. A recent review by <LINK REF="REF-Elia-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2011</LINK> demonstrated that many such studies of screening tools assessment and comparative studies of different tools may be prone to important limitations and biases. A further review assessed the predictive value of the nutritional screening tools, such as the Mini Nutritional Assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 2012</LINK>). The review concluded that the tool could predict, to some extent, a need for higher level care among older people. Such studies did not provide direct evidence of effect for nutritional screening programmes. Still, they demonstrated the need for further studies to develop effective interventions involving nutritional screening.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Holyday-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holyday 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bolin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bolin 2007</LINK> reported an RCT in which a nutritional intervention programme followed screening of all the patients in the control and intervention groups (hence these studies were not eligible for inclusion). These studies showed no effect on the overall length of stay, while the length of stay of malnourished patients decreased as a result of the intervention. Weight change and the readmission rate were not significantly different between the two groups.</P>
<P>There were several studies that used uncontrolled designs which considered the nutritional screening programmes and their impact on patient outcomes. A before-after study with no control group (<LINK REF="STD-Brugler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brugler 1999</LINK>) was conducted in a community hospital in the USA and assessed the effects of implementation of nutritional screening and malnutrition treatment pathways on patient health outcomes. The study reported that implementing a screening programme improved the proportion and timeliness of nutrition interventions in high risk patients, and decreased the incidence of major complications. A retrospective controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Kruizenga-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kruizenga 2005</LINK>) from the Netherlands assessed the effects of early recognition and treatment of hospital malnourished patients on length of stay and costs in a hospital setting. The results suggested improvements in malnutrition detection rates and a reduction in patients' length of stay in the hospital, with a modest increase in costs. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Vincent-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 2010</LINK>), from the UK, assessed the influence of implementing national UK guidance for nutritional screening on clinical outcomes of patients who received parenteral nutrition. While the study concluded that "compliance with the national guidance in the UK on screening did not improve outcomes in patients requiring parenteral nutrition in this cohort", the study design had important limitations, and hence the conclusions may not be valid. The study did not involve random allocation of patients (or hospital wards) to screening or not screening. Rather, it compared those patients that had actually been screened with those that had not. Given that the patients who are more likely to be at nutritional risk are more likely to be screened, it is not possible to conclude that screening was ineffective using the research design employed in the <LINK REF="STD-Vincent-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vincent 2010</LINK> study.</P>
<P>None of the studies mentioned above considered potential disadvantages of nutritional screening, in addition to the extra costs of implementing a screening programme. There is a risk that patients who are screened 'out' and are not considered a 'nutritional risk' (false negatives) could suffer from neglect as a result of screening. Also, nutritional screening might potentially result in ineffective or harmful interventions for some patients, but we found no study that assessed such potential outcomes of the screening programmes.</P>
<P>Future studies should consider the different implications of 'on admission nutritional screening' from 'screening as part of ongoing care'. While both approaches may result in changes in referrals to dietitians, the direction of effect for the latter approach might be different. Screening as part of ongoing care might be more likely to improve staff awareness, and might indirectly result in a reduced need for referrals. The included studies do not provide enough evidence on this issue, however, and <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 2003</LINK> noted that the nurses felt that the screening programme improved staff awareness.</P>
<P>Several studies and national and international guidance documents have recommended widespread application of screening programs. The NICE guideline on nutrition support in adults (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>) recommended screening for malnutrition "in all hospital inpatients on admission and all outpatients at their first clinic appointment". Also, nutritional screening for all care home residents has been emphasized in this guideline. In the USA, the Joint Commission and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition guidelines have recommended nutrition screening for hospitalised patients, while noting the limitations of the available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2011</LINK>). These recommendations for nutritional screening for patients in hospital and primary care settings demonstrate the clinical anxiety associated with the risks of undetected and untreated malnutrition. They may also demonstrate a degree of consensus among clinical experts. For example, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK> recommended nutritional screening based on a formal consensus among the guideline development group members. In this guideline, the effectiveness evidence was assessed, and the lack of research evidence based on valid interventional studies was noted in the process. However, in the absence of evidence, the guideline development group felt justified in making the recommendations for these high risk groups (that is hospital patients and home care residents). As another example, <LINK REF="STD-Huhmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Huhmann 2008</LINK> conducted a review that considered nutritional screening and assessment in cancer patients. They reported that &#8220;there are no studies that directly link the nutrition screening process to improved outcomes in oncology patients&#8221;. Despite this finding, the authors concluded that screening and recognition of malnourished patients can be effective in improving patient outcomes if severely malnourished patients receive nutritional intervention when they are identified via screening. On the other hand, <LINK REF="REF-Moreland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreland 2010</LINK> assessed studies of nutritional screening and counselling in adults with lung cancer and concluded that "targeting specific patients through screening and counselling may provide a significant benefit to their nutrition status and improve their quality of life".</P>
<P>In our study, only one of the included studies utilised a random allocation design. RCT designs are now frequently used for assessing the effectiveness of breast cancer screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjurstam-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjurstam 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1999</LINK>). As a notable example, a Cochrane systematic review included several RCTs of breast cancer screening interventions (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2011</LINK>). Additionally, several studies, including systematic reviews, have considered the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Rashidian-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rashidian 2013</LINK>). RCTs are also used for assessing the cervical cancer screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Anttila-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anttila 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie 2010</LINK>). Such a level of attention has not yet been devoted to the assessment of nutritional screening effectiveness.</P>
<P>In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and <I>The Cochrane Library</I> databases to identify the related studies. As such we may have missed potentially important, relevant studies not indexed in these databases. This is, however, unlikely to be the case, especially as our search strategy did not included any 'design' limitations, to increase the sensitivity of the search. We also considered non-randomised controlled studies for inclusion in the review to improve the likelihood of identifying relevant evidence. Our backward and forward citation searches revealed no further studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Also, we did not identify any included study published after 2004, suggesting that the research community may not have attended to the need for interventional studies to assess the effectiveness of nutritional screening. At the same time, there were several studies that compared one or more nutrition screening tools to determine their sensitivity and specificity rather than the overall effectiveness of nutritional screening versus standard care. One important reason for this may be the assumption that 'nutritional screening is effective', whilst remaining unaware of the paucity of such evidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-28 20:34:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings suggested no evidence of effect for nutritional screening. Available evidence is insufficient for making strong recommendations for practice. As such, our findings should not be a reason for reducing nutritional screening programmes in hospitals or care home settings for the elderly, given the prevalence and implications of malnutrition in such settings. However, the review suggests that such programmes should be designed and implemented carefully, and resources should be mobilised for increasing research funding for good quality interventional studies of nutritional screening.</P>

<P>As we noted above, the RCT design has been widely used for assessing the effectiveness of other screening programmes. Due to the lack of robust interventional studies, we strongly recommend that good quality RCTs are conducted to assess the outcomes (patient benefits as well as potential side effects) of nutritional screening in hospital and primary care settings. It would be prudent if such studies also consider the cost-effectiveness of nutritional screening.</P>
