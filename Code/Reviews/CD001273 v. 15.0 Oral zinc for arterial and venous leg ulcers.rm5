<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-11-23 12:08:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>Leg ulcers (open sores, usually on the lower leg) can be slow and difficult to heal. They may take weeks or months to heal. There is a high risk of the ulcer returning. Leg ulcers often cause distress to patients and are costly for health services. Failure to heal may be due in part to poor nutrition which reduces the ability of the body to repair itself. Minerals such as zinc are necessary for good healing and so it was thought that taking zinc sulphate tablets might aid healing of ulcers. We found six trials that used zinc to treat leg ulcers but all were too small to show a benefit, even if one exists. Furthermore the methods used in the existing trials mean that their results were possibly biased. On the basis of the evidence we have so far it appears that taking zinc tablets does not improve leg ulcer healing, however better quality trials are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:08:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Leg ulcers affect up to one percent of people at some time in their life. Leg ulceration is chronic in nature and ulcers may be present for months or even years without healing. After healing there is a high risk of recurrence. Treatments include wound dressings alongside the treatment of underlying medical problems such as poor blood supply, infection and poor nutrition.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of oral zinc in healing arterial or venous leg ulcers.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-09 09:57:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this seventh update we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 02 September 2014) and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 8). In the original version of the review a company manufacturing zinc sulphate tablets was asked for references to relevant trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-09-01 11:24:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing oral zinc sulphate with placebo or no treatment in people with arterial or venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. There were no restrictions on date or language of publication. The main outcome measure used was complete healing of the ulcers. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they measured ulcer healing objectively by documenting time to complete healing, proportion of ulcers healed during the study, or healing rates of ulcers.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:08:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>All data extraction and assessment of trial quality was done by both authors independently.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:28:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six small trials (183 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Four trials considered people with venous ulcers, one trial involved people with arterial ulcers and one people with mixed aetiology ulcers. Serum zinc was measured in four trials and four trials compared oral zinc sulphate with placebo in people with venous ulcers; pooling these trials indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups for healing (RR 1.22, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.68). Overall, there is no evidence that oral zinc increases the healing of arterial or venous leg ulcers.</P>

<P>Oral zinc sulphate does not appear to aid the healing of arterial and venous leg ulcers, however all included studies were small and at unclear risk of bias (due to poor reporting).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-09 10:23:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-12 16:57:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Leg ulcers are a common problem thought to affect about 1% of the population at some point in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1992</LINK>), and about 1.5/1000 of the population at any one time (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>). Leg ulcers are more common in women than men and their prevalence increases with age. Venous disease is present in the majority of cases; peripheral vascular disease may co-exist or may be the main cause of an ulcer. Other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, may also contribute. Leg ulceration is chronic in nature as ulcers may be present for months or years without healing, and once they have healed recurrence rates are high. Management approaches vary considerably in practice and include care of the ulcer using dressings and treatment of underlying medical problems such as malnutrition, lack of minerals and vitamins, poor blood supply or infection.</P>
<P>Zinc is an essential trace metal that is necessary for some enzymes and hormones to function. It also has anti-inflammatory effects on phagocytic cells (cells that 'swallow' and digest bacteria and cell debris) (<LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1996</LINK>). Zinc-deficient individuals (as determined by serum zinc levels) demonstrate slower wound healing and are more prone to infections. Zinc deficiency is treated with oral zinc sulphate (30 to 150 mg per day) (<LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although serum zinc is used to assess the zinc status of the body as a whole, it is not necessarily a meaningful measurement, since serum zinc levels display a diurnal (daylight-related) variation. They also rise immediately after meals but fall to below baseline levels within two hours. In people with severe zinc deficiency, serum zinc levels can be maintained by zinc released from tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 1991</LINK>). Consequently, serum zinc measurements do not necessarily reflect total body zinc (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies have indicated that the addition of zinc sulphate to the diet of rats promoted the healing of thermal burns and excised wounds, however, it was unclear if the rats' standard diet was zinc deficient (<LINK REF="REF-Strain-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strain 1954</LINK>).</P>
<P>A randomised controlled trial (RCT) in people with pilonidal sinus wounds suggested that oral zinc sulphate (220 mg three times daily) decreased the time to healing of the wounds by 43%; serum zinc concentrations of participants were not measured (<LINK REF="REF-Pories-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pories 1967</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review set out to summarise the evidence for the effectiveness of oral zinc sulphate in promoting the healing of leg ulcers. </P>

<P>Full copies of all studies which appeared eligible from the search were obtained and were checked by two review authors who jointly made decisions about inclusion. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. The author of one of the trials was contacted for clarification of details of his trial.

<P>No new studies were identified in this latest review update. As a result of previous searches, a total of eighteen studies of oral zinc sulphate (440 to 660 mg per day) for the treatment of venous or arterial leg ulcers was retrieved in full. Of these twelve studies did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the review for the following reasons; eight were non-randomized studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carruthers-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Carruthers 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floersheim-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Floersheim 1980a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floersheim-1980b" TYPE="STUDY">Floersheim 1980b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Husain-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Husain 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myers-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Myers 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubisz_x002d_Brzezinska-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rubisz-Brzezinska 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tschumi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Tschumi 1981</LINK>), two used alternate allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Floersheim-1980c" TYPE="STUDY">Floersheim 1980c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gueri-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gueri 1975</LINK>), one did not meet inclusion criteria for minimum duration of ulcer (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1976</LINK>) and one was not a trial but a review article (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2003</LINK>)(see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Six RCTs were included (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). All included studies were relatively small, with between 10 and 42 participants.</P>
<P>Four of the included trials involved hospital outpatients, the fifth trial concerned inpatients and the sixth described the participants as ambulant patients, but did not specify whether they were inpatients or outpatients. Five of the trials included patients with venous ulcers; one included patients with arterial ulcers only. Three trials were conducted in England and three in Sweden.</P>
<P>Five studies were comparisons of oral zinc sulphate with placebo, while the sixth trial used a control group that received no treatment. The durations of treatment with zinc sulphate varied from four weeks to a year. Results were reported as the number of ulcers healed at the end of the study and, in some cases, by the average rate of healing. No study reported the time to complete healing of ulcers.</P>
<P>Four studies measured serum zinc at baseline and during the trial period (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haegar-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Haegar 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hallbook-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Hallbook 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1977</LINK>). The definition of a normal serum zinc concentration varied between studies: <LINK REF="STD-Hallbook-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Hallbook 1972</LINK> used 110 micrograms/100 ml; <LINK REF="STD-Haegar-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Haegar 1974</LINK> 85 micrograms/100 ml; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1977</LINK> 127.5 micrograms/100 ml, while <LINK REF="STD-Clayton-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 1972</LINK> only described the group mean. Only the <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1977</LINK> trial mentioned the time at which samples were taken (afternoon).</P>
<P>Use of mean serum zinc as the cut point between low and normal serum zinc is not appropriate, as it will vary with each group and may give rise to erroneous results. Those below the group mean may be regarded as having 'low' serum zinc and yet in other studies would be well above the cut-off level.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Haegar-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Haegar 1974</LINK> study involving people with leg ulcers due to arterial disease all but two of the 30 ulcers healed within one year (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The two non-healing ulcers were both in the control group and the patients had low serum zinc levels. The two ulcers that failed to heal were also both much larger than the average initial size (by 33% and 160%), which reduced their probability of healing. The average rate of re-epithelialisation in the subgroup with low serum zinc that received oral zinc was 6.2 mm²/day compared with the subgroup with low serum zinc that received placebo (2.6 mm²/day). Mean values only were provided, which limited further analysis. Furthermore, the groups were not balanced at baseline (ulcers were 26% larger in the zinc group).<BR/>No information was given regarding the length of time ulcers took to heal so, it was not clear if there was an appreciable difference in the time to ulcer healing between the different groups.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Haegar-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Haegar 1972</LINK>: the number of ulcers healed at 12 weeks was 11 out of 15 (73%) in the zinc group and 11 out of 21 (52%) in the placebo group (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.33) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hallbook-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Hallbook 1972</LINK>: the number of ulcers healed at 18 weeks was nine out of 13 (69%) in the zinc treatment group, and eight out of 14 (57%) in the placebo group (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.25) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The authors then undertook a subgroup analysis to examine the effect of zinc in those with low serum zinc. It is not clear if this analysis was pre-specified. People with serum zinc below 110 micrograms per 100 ml who received zinc sulphate were not significantly more likely to heal (5/7 or 71%) than those with low serum zinc in the placebo group (1/7 or 14%), (RR 5.0, 95% CI 0.77 to 32.57). Mean zinc-serum levels were measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks.

<P>Of the people with serum zinc concentrations greater than 110 micrograms per 100ml, four out of six in the zinc group (67%) healed compared with seven out of seven (100%) of people in the placebo group. This difference was not statistically significant, (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.23).</P>

<P>Pooling the four trials that compared oral zinc sulphate with placebo in people with venous ulcers (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%) showed no statistically significant difference between the two group (RR 1.22, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.68) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:28:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently no evidence that oral zinc speeds the healing of either venous or arterial leg ulcers, though the available evidence is limited and of poor quality. Studies of oral zinc vary substantially in terms of the duration of treatment, follow up and prognostic comparability of treatment groups at baseline. All existing studies were too small to be able to detect a moderate effect of zinc.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-12 17:38:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review are based on small trials of poor quality. At present there is no evidence to support the use of oral zinc sulphate in the treatment of people with leg ulcers due to venous or arterial disease. This finding, should however, be contextualised within the generally low quality of the included studies. Patient numbers in all the trials were too small to detect any effect of zinc sulphate as statistically significant in either direction.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:29:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If further research is conducted to look at the effect of using oral zinc sulphate to treat people with leg ulcers, these trials should be robust in design. The following points should be taken into consideration in the design of any future studies:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Recommendations outlined in the CONSORT Statement should be adopted as far as possible.</LI>
<LI>Recruitment numbers should be based on an a priori sample size calculation. In many trials the sample size is too small to detect clinically important differences between treatments as statistically significant. In order to recruit sufficient patient numbers, multicentre trials should be more frequently considered. When these trials are commissioned they require a strong infrastructure to provide support and promote collaboration.</LI>
<LI>The method of random sequence generation and treatment allocation should ensure low risk of bias (i.e., computer generated randomisation programme with allocation concealment e.g., by using a remote, telephone randomisation service.</LI>
<LI>The primary endpoint of treatment trials should be complete ulcer healing and the primary outcome should preferably be time to healing, analysed by survival methods. In addition, the length of follow-up needs to be of sufficient duration to capture a meaningful proportion of events. </LI>
<LI>For each patient a single reference ulcer should be selected. Multiple ulcers on a patient should not be randomised individually and considered as independent unless the trial has been specifically designed to accommodate this, and appropriate statistical analysis, that accounts for clustering, prespecified.</LI>
<LI>Assessment of outcomes should be undertaken either by assessors masked to trial treatment or confirmed by remote, blinded adjudication from photographs.</LI>
<LI>Analysis should be according to intention-to-treat.</LI>
<LI>Evaluations should provide sufficiently full details of the interventions used, including descriptions of all components of compression, such that readers would be able to apply the treatments described (with training where necessary).</LI>
<LI>Evaluations should report the skill level of staff providing care.</LI>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The reviewers appear to have scored quality of allocation concealment according to what the trial investigators reported about double blinding. In order to see the quality scores for concealment of allocation the reader has to display `Quality' in MetaView. The review authors report that the method of random allocation was not described in any of the included trials. We would, therefore, expect all the trials to score 'B' (Unclear) for quality of allocation concealment. However, trials reported as double blind have been scored 'A', and the one trial reported as not blinded has been assigned category 'D' (which means that a quality score was not used). The Cochrane Handbook Section 6.3, and Schulz KF et al. JAMA 1995; 273(5):408-12 and 274(18):1456-8, explain the difference between allocation concealment and treatment blinding. The guide to using Review Manager software advises on the use of the category 'D'.</P>

<P>Odds ratios are misleading when event rates are high. The relative risk should be used instead. For example, in the study Hallbrook (1972), 9/13 versus 8/14 for `number healed at 18 weeks', which intuitively are rather similar rates, is reported by the reviewers as Peto odds ratio 1.95, but the relative risk is only 1.25.<BR/>The overall picture tends to get lost in detailed description of results from each individual study. For example: "Haegar (1974) found all but two of the 30 ulcers healed within one year OR 8.73 (0.49, 156.29), the two that did not heal were both in the control group and had a low serum zinc. The two ulcers that failed to heal were both much larger than the average...". Overall, the event rate was 16/16 versus 12/14. The reported Peto odds ratio is 8.73, but the more appropriate relative risk is only 1.40.<BR/>The review authors should do a pooled analysis of the trials in venous ulcer, regardless of the fact that the length of follow-up varied between trials. This is permissible, since the results are so consistent across the four trials. The total number of healed ulcers is 33/65 versus 33/76, which corresponds to a relative risk of 1.22 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.68). Over all trials, therefore, there is no<BR/>evidence of effect.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>"There is some evidence to suggest that zinc might promote healing in individuals who have low serum zinc. This needs further evaluation". This statement seems to be unwarranted. The reviewers correctly point out that the study that suggested this (Hallbrook 1972) may be flawed in design, conduct and analysis. Hallbrook found no difference overall (9/13 versus 8/14 ulcers healed), the investigators then did a subgroup analysis, probably post hoc, of patients with low serum zinc which showed 5/7 versus 1/7 ulcers healed. Subgroup analyses must always be interpreted with caution, but they are particularly inappropriate when there is no overall effect.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>"There is limited evidence that zinc may be beneficial in the treatment of venous leg ulcers when there is a low serum zinc, but recommendations for the dose and duration of treatment cannot be made on the available information." The reviewers should not accept this implication, which is based only on the study by Hallbrook.</P>

<P>Email received from Joel Steinberg as follows: 'I note an opening comment to the effect that most leg wounds will heal with good local wound care even though this could take weeks to months. Really? My experience beyond training in vascular medicine and many years of practice, is that stasis ulcers usually require a compression gradient bandaging and/or reduction of underlying venous hypertension in order to heal, and ischemic wounds usually require revascularization. I am concerned that to state otherwise is misleading. Are there strong studies to support the comment of concern? Of additional concern is the phrase 'may be due to poor nutrition'. Indeed there are likely cases where nutrition may be a factor leading to slow healing. But my experience is that it would be quite unusual to find a case where nutrition is the sole factor to explain delayed healing. Rather, usually other factors that accompany poor nutrition are at play, such as poor hygiene and poor compliance. Permit me to suggest that the above phrase be slightly revised, to read in part, 'may in part be due to poor nutrition.' I think adding that small caveat will provide the reader with a more accurate picture of the issues at work in trying to get a wound to heal. Again I applaud the author for a fine and helpful review. The work will provide the medical community with important information.'</P>

<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.
