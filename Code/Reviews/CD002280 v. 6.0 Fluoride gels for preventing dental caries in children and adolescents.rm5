<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The main question was: How effective and safe is the use of fluoride gel for the prevention of tooth decay (dental caries) in children and adolescents compared to placebo (a treatment without the active ingredient fluoride) or no treatment?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Tooth decay is a significant health problem worldwide, affecting not only the vast majority of adults but also 60% to 90% of children. Levels of tooth decay vary between and within countries, but it is generally true that children in lower socioeconomic groups (measured by income, education and employment) have more tooth decay. Over time, untreated tooth decay causes progressive destruction of the tops of teeth (crowns); this is often accompanied by severe pain. Repairing and replacing decayed teeth is extremely costly in terms of time and money and is a major drain on the resources of healthcare systems.</P>
<P>The prevention of tooth decay in children and adolescents is regarded as a priority for dental services and is considered more cost-effective than its treatment. The use of fluoride, a mineral that prevents tooth decay, is widespread. As well as occurring naturally, fluoride is added to the water supply in some areas, and it is used in most toothpastes and in other products that are available to varying degrees worldwide. As an extra preventive measure there are other ways of applying fluoride directly to teeth, such as mouthrinses, lozenges, varnishes and gels.</P>
<P>Fluoride gel is usually applied by a dental professional, or self applied under supervision (depending on the age of the child), from once a year to several times a year. The gel is usually placed in a tray that the child or young person must keep in their mouth and bite into for about four minutes. It is not uncommon for young people to accidentally swallow some of the gel; feelings of sickness, vomiting, headache and stomach pain have been reported when too much is swallowed. Due to this risk of toxicity, fluoride gel treatment is not generally recommended for children less than six years old.</P>
<P>This review updates the Cochrane review of fluoride gels for preventing tooth decay in children and adolescents that was first published in 2002. We assessed the existing research for the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current up to 5 November 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 28 studies in which over 9000 children (aged 2 to 15 years) were randomised to treatment with fluoride gel or to a control group using placebo gel or receiving no treatment. Study duration ranged from 1 to 4 years (with 13 studies lasting around 2 years). Study reports were published between 1967 and 2005. Thirteen studies took place in the USA, seven in Europe, four in Brazil and one each in Canada, Israel, China and Venezuela.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review update confirmed that fluoride gel can reduce tooth decay in children and adolescents. We combined the results of 25 trials and found that on average there is a 28% reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (21% reduction in trials that used a placebo gel in the control group and 38% reduction in trials where the control group received no treatment) in permanent teeth. From the three trials looking at the effect of fluoride gel on first or baby teeth, the evidence suggests that using fluoride gel results in a 20% reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces. We found little information about unwanted or harmful effects or how well children and young people were able to cope with the application of the gel.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>The application of fluoride gel results in a large reduction in tooth decay in both permanent and baby teeth. We found little information about potential unwanted or harmful effects from accidental swallowing of the gel during treatment. As children often swallow gel during application, more research is needed on these effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence available for permanent teeth is of moderate quality. The evidence on baby teeth is low quality because of the small number of studies available. The evidence available for adverse effects is very low quality.</P>

<P>Topically applied fluoride gels have been widely used as a caries-preventive intervention in dental surgeries and school-based programmes for over three decades.

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-06-09 17:32:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride gels in preventing dental caries in the child and adolescent population.</P>
<P>The secondary objectives are to examine whether the effect of fluoride gels is influenced by the following: initial level of caries severity; background exposure to fluoride in water (or salt), toothpastes, or reported fluoride sources other than the study option(s); mode of use (self applied under supervision or operator-applied), and whether there is a differential effect between the tray and toothbrush methods of application; frequency of use (times per year) or fluoride concentration (ppm F).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 5 November 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 5 November 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 5 November 2014), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 5 November 2014), LILACS and BBO via the BIREME Virtual Health Library (1980 to 5 November 2014), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 5 November 2014) and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1945 to 5 November 2014). We undertook a search for ongoing trials on <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 5 November 2014. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication in the search of the electronic databases. We also searched reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:26:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials where blind outcome assessment was stated or indicated, comparing topically applied fluoride gel with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years. The frequency of application had to be at least once a year, and study duration at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces in both permanent and primary teeth (D(M)FS and d(e/m)fs).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:26:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We contacted study authors for additional information where required. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF), that is, the difference in mean caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. We performed random-effects meta-analyses where we could pool data. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity in random-effects metaregression analyses. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-01 15:44:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>We included 28 trials (3 of which are new trials since the original review), involving 9140 children and adolescents. Most of these trials recruited participants from schools. Most of the studies (20) were at high risk of bias, with 8 at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Twenty-five trials (8479 participants) contributed data for meta-analysis on permanent tooth surfaces: the D(M)FS pooled prevented fraction (PF) estimate was 28% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 19% to 36%; P &lt; 0.0001; with substantial heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 82%); moderate quality evidence). Subgroup and metaregression analyses suggested no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and the prespecified trial characteristics. However, the effect of fluoride gel varied according to the type of control group used, with D(M)FS PF on average being 17% (95% CI 3% to 31%; P = 0.018) higher in non-placebo-controlled trials (the reduction in caries was 38% (95% CI 24% to 52%; P &lt; 0.0001, 2808 participants) for the 10 trials with no treatment as control group, and 21% (95% CI 15% to 28%; P &lt; 0.0001, 5671 participants) for the 15 placebo-controlled trials. A funnel plot of the 25 trials in the D(M)FS PF meta-analysis indicated a relationship between prevented fraction and study precision, with an apparent lack of small studies with statistically significant large effects.</P>
<P>The d(e/m)fs pooled prevented fraction estimate for the three trials (1254 participants) that contributed data for the meta-analysis on primary teeth surfaces was 20% (95% CI 1% to 38%; P = 0.04; with no heterogeneity (P = 0.54; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%); low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was limited reporting of adverse events. Only two trials reported information on acute toxicity signs and symptoms during the application of the gel (risk difference 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02; P = 0.36; with no heterogeneity (P = 36; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%); 490 participants; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported information on tooth staining, mucosal irritation or allergic reaction.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:20:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those when it was first published. There is moderate quality evidence of a large caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride gel in the permanent dentition. Information concerning the caries-preventive effect of fluoride gel on the primary dentition, which also shows a large effect, is based on low quality evidence from only three placebo-controlled trials. There is little information on adverse effects or on acceptability of treatment. Future trials should include assessment of potential adverse effects.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-27 18:03:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic disease, afflicting a significant proportion of the world population, including around 60% to 90% of school-aged children and the vast majority of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Marcenes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcenes 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2004</LINK>). In general, dental caries levels vary considerably between and within different countries, but children in the lower socioeconomic status groups have higher caries levels than those in the upper socioeconomic status groups, and in high-income countries the association between socioeconomic position and caries might be stronger (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwendicke-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwendicke 2015</LINK>). Untreated caries causes progressive destruction of the crowns of the teeth, often accompanied by severe pain and suffering, especially in children, where it can result in poorer quality of life and general health (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2005</LINK>). Untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent condition among all evaluated in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study, affecting 35% of the global population, or 2.4 billion people, and untreated caries in deciduous teeth was the 10th most prevalent condition, affecting 9% of the population, or 621 million children worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Kassebaum-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassebaum 2015</LINK>). The repair and replacement of carious teeth is excessively time consuming and costly, representing a major drain of resources for healthcare systems. On a population basis, dental caries is the fourth most expensive chronic disease to treat, according to the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dental caries occurs because of demineralisation of tooth structure by organic acids formed by oral bacteria present in dental plaque through the anaerobic metabolism of dietary sugars. The causal role of sugars in caries is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2001</LINK>). The majority of caries lesions in children&#8217;s permanent teeth advance relatively slowly, with an average lesion taking three years to progress through tooth enamel to dentine (<LINK REF="REF-Mejare-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mejare 1998</LINK>). The dental caries process is influenced by the susceptibility of the tooth surface, the bacterial profile, the quantity and quality of saliva, and the presence of fluoride, which promotes remineralisation and inhibits the demineralisation of the tooth structure.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-27 18:01:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluoride gels are widely used in dental surgeries and school-based caries-preventive programmes. Although currently recommended only for children with moderate and high caries levels, the cost-effectiveness of gels has been questioned even for these populations (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>). Fluoride gels are either administered by a professional or are self applied under supervision. In general, operator-applied fluoride gels use trays and self applied gels use either a tray or a toothbrush. Fluoride gels must be differentiated from some fluoride toothpastes, which are also available in the form of gels. The 'classical' fluoride gels do not contain abrasives, their fluoride concentration is usually much higher than that of a fluoride toothpaste and they are applied at relatively infrequent intervals. Various methods, concentrations and frequencies of gel applications have been tested, with or without prior dental prophylaxis, and different fluoride compounds have been used. Typically, acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) gels in the concentration of 12,300 parts per million of fluoride (ppm F) are professionally applied twice a year. The excessive ingestion of fluoride during topical application is not an uncommon occurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Whitford-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitford 1992</LINK>); the greatest health hazard is associated with the use of 12,300 ppm F APF gels, where a considerable amount of fluoride may be retained after application. The probable toxic dose of 100 mg of fluoride for a 20 kg (five- to six-year-old) child is contained in only 8 ml volumes of these gels. Approximately 5 ml is used in a topical application of APF gel in a tray, representing a potential exposure of 61.5 mg of fluoride ion. There is a significant risk of overexposure, which can result in acute toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1990</LINK>). Young people receiving fluoride gel applications have reported nausea, vomiting, headache and abdominal pain. Because of the risk of overingestion, the use of fluoride gels in young children is not generally recommended.</P>
<P>Numerous clinical trials evaluating the caries-preventive effect of fluoride gels have been reported; these have been the subject of narrative reviews, in <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>, and of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>). Although it is evident from these reviews and meta-analyses that fluoride gels are caries-inhibitory treatments, they either failed to include a comprehensive and well-designed search for individual trials or a formal evaluation of the risk of bias in included trials, despite obvious drawbacks in the design and methods in the studies.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-09 18:00:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most important anticaries effect of fluoride is considered to result from its local action on the tooth/plaque interface, through promoting remineralisation of early caries lesions and by reducing tooth enamel solubility (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>). Enamel demineralisation is markedly inhibited if fluoride is present at the time of the acid challenge because fluoride diffuses with the acid from plaque into the enamel and acts at the crystal surface to reduce mineral loss. When the pH rises following demineralisation, fluoride can combine with dissolved calcium and phosphate ions to precipitate or grow fluorapatite-like crystalline material within the tooth. Fluoride enhances this mineral gain and provides a material that is more resistant to subsequent acid attack (<LINK REF="REF-ten-Cate-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ten Cate 1999</LINK>). This occurs with all forms and concentrations of topical fluoride, although to a variable extent. Regular use of fluoride toothpaste or mouthrinse results in sustained elevated fluoride concentrations in the oral fluids during the demineralisation-remineralisation cycle, but with higher concentration topical fluoride vehicles (such as varnishes and gels), calcium fluoride is precipitated on the enamel surface and in the plaque. This calcium fluoride acts as a fluoride reservoir that is released when the oral pH falls. Thus, gels deliver fluoride to the surface of enamel and to subsurface carious lesions, where it forms deposits of calcium fluoride and provides a reservoir of fluoride ions, and the amount of fluoride deposition in the subsurface lesion is greater after topical applications with such high-concentration fluoride (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents is generally regarded as a priority for dental services and considered more cost-effective than its treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1998</LINK>). Fluoride therapy has been the centrepiece of caries-preventive strategies since the introduction of water fluoridation schemes over five decades ago (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991</LINK>). These were introduced when caries was highly prevalent and severe, and when even modest prevention activities led to considerable reductions in disease levels. In the last 30 years, with the substantial decline in dental caries rates in many Western countries, an increase in dental fluorosis (mottled enamel) levels in some countries, and intensive research on the mechanism of action of fluoride highlighting the primary importance of its topical effect, greater attention has been paid to the appropriate use of other fluoride-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mullane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mullane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of topically applied fluoride products in particular, which are much more concentrated than the fluoride in drinking water, has increased over recent decades. By definition, the term 'topically applied fluoride' is used to describe those delivery systems that provide fluoride to exposed surfaces of the dentition, at elevated concentrations, for a local protective effect, and are therefore not intended for ingestion. Fluoride-containing toothpastes (dentifrices), mouthrinses, gels and varnishes are the modalities most commonly used at present, either alone or in combination. Various products are marketed in different countries and a variety of caries-preventive programmes based on these have been implemented. Toothpastes are by far the most widespread form of fluoride usage (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>), and although the reasons for the decline in the prevalence of dental caries in children from different countries has been the subject of much debate (<LINK REF="REF-de-Liefde-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Liefde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krasse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nadanovsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadanovsky 1995</LINK>), it has been mainly attributed to the use of fluoride in toothpaste and the increase in regular home use of toothpaste (<LINK REF="REF-Bratthall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bratthall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mullane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mullane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolla-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolla 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the same time, the lower caries prevalence in many countries now and the widespread availability of fluoride from multiple sources have raised the question of whether topically applied fluorides are still effective in reducing caries, and safe, mainly in terms of the potential risk of fluorosis. This is particularly important as nearly all child populations in high-income countries are exposed to some source of fluoride, notably in toothpaste, and adverse effects may be rare (such as acute fluoride toxicity) or more subtle (such as mild dental fluorosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence on the effect of topically applied fluoride products on the prevention of dental caries in children has been extensively reviewed in traditional narrative reviews. A number of systematic reviews focusing on the evaluation of specific fluoride active agents within specific delivery systems have used a quantitative meta-analytical approach to synthesise trials results (<LINK REF="REF-Ammari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartizek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartizek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaves-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaves 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helfenstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfenstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strohmenger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strohmenger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>). However, there has been no systematic investigation evaluating and comparing the effects of the main modalities of topically applied fluoride treatments and examining formally the main factors that may influence their effectiveness.</P>
<P>This review is one in a series of systematic reviews of topical-fluoride interventions and assesses the effectiveness of fluoride gels for the prevention of dental caries in children. It is an update of the review first published in 2002, which showed clear evidence of a caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride gel in the permanent teeth of children (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>). It is generally recognised that blinding is particularly important when outcome measures require specific criteria to improve objectivity in measurement, such as in the assessment of dental caries. Of note in this series of topical-fluoride reviews is that lack of blinding in main outcome assessment (caries increment), or lack of any indication of blind outcome assessment remains an exclusion criterion &#8211; that is, studies are excluded if open outcome assessment is reported or if blind outcome assessment is not reported and is unlikely to have been used.</P>

<P>At least two review authors undertook the assessment of the risk of bias in all of the included trials independently. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by the involvement of another review author. We used The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic</I> <I>Reviews of Interventions</I> version 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), but according to pre-defined criteria that were adapted and refined for the Cochrane topical-fluoride reviews updates. We assessed eight domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants/personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, balance of baseline characteristics, and free from contamination or co-intervention, according to the tool. Each domain included one or more specific entries in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, we described information reported in the study and assigned a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. Where the study clearly reported the methodology, we made a judgement of 'low risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias'. Where trial methodology was unclear, we judged a domain as at 'unclear risk of bias' unless and until further information becomes available.</P>
<P>After considering additional information provided by the authors of the trials, we assessed the overall risk of bias in included trials over all eight domains. We assigned studies into the following categories.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-05-27 18:15:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The chosen measure of treatment effect for the primary outcome measure, caries increment, was the prevented fraction (PF), that is (mean increment in the controls minus mean increment in the treated group) divided by mean increment in the controls. For an outcome such as caries increment, where discrete counts are considered to approximate to a continuous scale and are treated as continuous data, we considered this measure more appropriate than the mean difference or standardised mean difference since it allows combination of different ways of measuring caries increment and a meaningful investigation of heterogeneity between trials. It is also simple to interpret.</P>
<P>For outcomes other than caries increment, we summarised continuous data as average mean differences (MD) in treatment effects and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), or if different scales had been used to measure the same outcome in different trials, standardised mean differences (SMD) and their 95% CI. We analysed dichotomous outcome data by calculating risk ratios (RR) or, for adverse effects of fluoride treatment, risk differences (RD).</P>

<P>We decided that missing standard deviations for caries increments that we could not obtain after contacting the original researchers would be imputed through linear regression of log standard deviations on log mean caries increments. This is a suitable approach for caries prevention trials since, as they follow an approximate Poisson distribution, caries increments are closely related (similar) to their standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes reporting bias (within-study reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>Within-study reporting bias (one of the eight 'Risk of bias' domains listed above, as 'selective outcome reporting') would ideally be assessed by comparing the outcomes reported in the published report against the study protocol. As this was not possible, we compared the outcomes listed in the methods section with the results reported. If results were mentioned but not reported adequately in a way that allowed analysis (for example, only mentioned whether the results were statistically significant or not), we sought further information from authors of the study reports. Otherwise, we noted this as 'high risk' of bias. If there was insufficient information to judge the risk of bias, we noted this as unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Funnel plots (plots of the effect estimates versus the inverse of their standard errors) were drawn where there were sufficient trials (more than 10). Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate publication bias and other biases related to sample size, though this may also represent a true relationship between trial size and size of treatment.

Variances were estimated using the formula presented in <LINK REF="REF-Dubey-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubey 1965</LINK>, which was more suitable for use in a weighted average, and for large sample sizes the approximation should be reasonable. It was noted in a previous review, <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2013</LINK>) that this formula was inappropriate for studies with small increments, and we excluded the data from such studies from the analysis in this review.

<P>We specified four potential sources of heterogeneity a priori, as these formed part of the primary objectives of the review. We hypothesised that the effect of fluoride gels differs according to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the baseline levels of caries severity;</LI>
<LI>exposure to other fluoride sources (in water, in toothpastes, etc.);</LI>
<LI>mode (self applied supervised or operator applied) and method (self applied tray or toothbrush) of application; and</LI>
<LI>frequency of application and fluoride concentration.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We examined the association of these factors with estimated effects (D(M)FS PFs) by performing random-effects metaregression analyses in Stata version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, USA) using the 'metareg' command (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>To allow such investigation, we dealt with relevant data as follows: data on 'baseline levels of caries' were calculated from the study sample analysed (final sample) unless otherwise stated, and were averaged among all relevant study groups. Data on 'background exposure to other fluoride sources' combined data on the use of fluoride toothpaste and the consumption of fluoridated water (or salt) and were grouped into two categories: one for studies that were based on samples provided with non-fluoride toothpaste and that were from non-fluoridated areas (non-exposed), and another for studies based on samples using fluoride toothpaste or studies in fluoridated communities, or both. We considered exposure to water fluoridation when fluoride levels in water were stated to be above 0.3 ppm F. Use of fluoride toothpaste reported for 30% or more of the study sample would indicate exposure to fluoridated toothpaste. When use or non-use of fluoride toothpaste was not clearly indicated in studies carried out in high-income countries, we assumed that fluoride toothpaste was widely used from the middle of the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1989</LINK>); we sought this information from authors (or obtained from other sources) when missing from studies carried out in other locations. When data on the year a study had begun was not provided, we calculated this as a 'probable date' by subtracting the duration of the study (in years) plus one extra year, from the publication date of the study. We classified the 'gel application modes/methods' as either operator- or self applied under supervision and as self applied supervised application by tray or brush. We have categorised data on 'frequency of application' and 'fluoride concentration applied' (cutoff points used were &gt; twice per year and &#8805; 10,000 ppm F, respectively). Since both covariates, fluoride concentration and frequency of application, are unlikely to be linear scales, we chose arbitrary but sensible cut points (unlikely to change results if different cutoffs are used), and felt it was inappropriate to undertake a metaregression analysis multiplying frequency by concentration. We averaged concentrations in multiple-arm studies over fluoride gel groups.</P>
<P>We investigated further potential sources of heterogeneity by metaregression: for different types of control groups (placebo or no treatment), use or not of prior prophylaxis, length of follow-up (years) and dropout rate (%), but these 'post hoc' analyses were reported as such and findings should be treated with caution.</P>

<P>We planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis including the trials with an overall assessment of low risk of bias, but there were no trials satisfying this criterion. We undertook a sensitivity analysis excluding trials where we imputed missing standard deviations.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall 'quality of evidence' for each outcome in the studies in the main comparisons; we have presented the primary outcomes in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. This table provides outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all outcomes that we rate as important to patient care and decision-making.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct; we apply this in the interpretation of results. The four possible ratings are 'high', 'moderate', 'low', and 'very low'. A rating of 'high' quality of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of 'very low' quality implies that any estimates of effect obtained are very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach considers evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as 'high' quality. However, the following factors can decrease the quality of evidence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>study limitations (risk of bias);</LI>
<LI>inconsistency;</LI>
<LI>Indirectness of evidence;</LI>
<LI>imprecision;</LI>
<LI>publication bias.</LI>

<P>Decayed, missing and filled surfaces (D(M)FS) at baseline<B>,</B> reported in all but three of the studies, ranged from 0 to 12.2; in the two studies that reported data for the primary dentition it was 0 dmfs and 3.7 defs (where 'e' is teeth indicated for extraction). With regard to 'background exposure to other fluoride sources', all studies reported whether or not participants had exposure to systemic sources; only five studies were conducted in fluoridated communities: water fluoridation in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Englander-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Englander 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Englander-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Englander 1978</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Szwejda-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Szwejda 1972</LINK>) and salt fluoridation in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970a" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970a</LINK>).

<P>Seventeen of the included trials reported gel application carried out by professionals (operator applied). In the remaining 11 trials gel was self applied under supervision (by dental personnel in 4 trials, by trained non-dental personnel in 5 trials, and by mothers and dental personnel in 1 trial; data were not available for 1 of the studies). Gel was usually administered using a tray (18 trials) or a brush (6 trials), but the use of floss was reported in 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>), and cotton-tip paint application was reported in 2 trials carried out in Brazil and in 1 trial from USA (<LINK REF="STD-Abadia-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Abadia 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bijella-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bijella 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cobb-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cobb 1980</LINK>). A variety of fluoride gel types were used, including acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) (21 trials), sodium fluoride (NaF) (7 trials), amine fluoride (AmF) (5 trials) and stannous fluoride (SnF2) (used in the <LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK> study only). The fluoride concentrations ranged from 2425 ppm F (SnF2) to 12,500 ppm F (AmF and NaF). Fourteen trials used the common 12,300 ppm F APF gel concentration.

; 
<LINK REF="STD-Mestrinho-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mestrinho 1983</LINK>). The application frequency (times per year) ranged from once a year (reported in 7 studies) to 140 times a year (reported in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Englander-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Englander 1967</LINK>
), but it varied greatly among the studies, with 8 studies reporting the more common twice a year application frequency. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Shern-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Shern 1976</LINK> (with 5 consecutive once a day or once a week applications in 1 year), all 17 studies where fluoride gel was professionally applied reported a frequency of application of 4 times a year or less. With 1 exception (<LINK REF="STD-Trubman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Trubman 1973</LINK>), where frequency of application was 4 times a year, the 11 studies of self applied gel reported a frequency of application of 5 times a year or more. Only a few studies reported the amount of gel applied (either in 'ml' or 'gr'), which ranged from 1 ml to 4 ml, and from 1 mg to 3 mg. Reported application times ranged from 2 to 10 minutes, with 16 studies reporting 3 to 5 minutes gel application time. Sixteen trials reported information about the performance of some form of prior (professional or self performed) tooth prophylaxis before administering the gel: 2 trials were performed with no paste (<LINK REF="STD-Cobb-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cobb 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hagan 1985</LINK>), and 14 trials were performed with a non-fluoride paste (if with a fluoride paste the trial would have been excluded); we considered the prior tooth cleaning as a possible part of the technique of gel application and not as a separate intervention on its own.</P>

Three of the 11 trials that reported D(M)FS data on specific teeth or tooth surfaces -- first molars, occlusal, mesio-distal (approximal) and/or bucco-lingual -- did not report data on all tooth surfaces (<LINK REF="STD-Cons-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Cons 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2005</LINK>). Fourteen trials presented caries increment (D(M)FS) data at a single follow-up time only, and the remaining 14 trials had data (D(M)FS/de/mfs) reported at more than 1 follow-up time; overall, 12 trials had caries increment data reported at 1 year follow-up time, 14 trials at 2 years, 9 trials at 3 years and 2 trials at 4 years (<LINK REF="STD-Truin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Truin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rijkom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rijkom 2004</LINK>). Follow-up of two years was thus the most common among all trials. In four trials, assessments of D(M)FS increments were also made during a postintervention follow-up period.</P>

Seven trials used X-rays in addition to visual examination (<LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1980" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mainwaring-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mainwaring 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970a" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Truin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Truin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rijkom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rijkom 2004</LINK>). Clinical (all 28 trials) and radiographic examinations (7 trials) provided the definition of different stages or grades of caries lesions. These have been grouped into two basic grades for each method of examination: NCA = non-cavitated incipient enamel lesions clinically visible as white spots or discoloured fissures; CA = lesions showing loss of enamel continuity that can be recorded clinically (undermined enamel, softened floor/walls) or showing frank cavitation; ER = any radiolucency in enamel/enamel-dentin junction; DR = radiolucency into dentin. Fourteen trials presented results using one caries grade only: the dentine cavitation level of diagnosis (CA/DR); the 14 remaining trials either did not report the diagnostic grade/level for caries (8 trials), in which case CA/DR was assumed, or reported both the cavitation (CA) and the non-cavitation (NCA) grades, in which case CA was chosen. Eleven trials specified data on state of tooth eruption considered: 10 trials reported data for teeth erupted at baseline only and only 1 trial reported combined data for erupting and erupted teeth (<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1970</LINK>). Only the two studies of <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970</LINK> did not use full-mouth recording.</P>

<P>One trial reported data on the proportion of children developing new caries (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>), and two trials reported data on the proportion of children not remaining caries-free (<LINK REF="STD-Englander-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Englander 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>). Adverse symptoms (nausea/vomiting) were reported to have been assessed in three trials: two trials had useable data (one reported that there were no events (<LINK REF="STD-Mestrinho-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mestrinho 1983</LINK>), and another reported that three participants from the treatment group experienced one event each (<LINK REF="STD-Hagan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hagan 1985</LINK>)), but the remaining trial reported no clear data (the event was reported to have occurred 'in many subjects') (<LINK REF="STD-Ingraham-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Ingraham 1970</LINK>). Other outcome measures were reported, but without complete or useable data: one trial reported 'no side effects', another trial reported 'no etching of enamel', and two trials reported 'no inadvertent swallowing of fluoride gel'. Data for unacceptability of the treatment regimen and for unacceptability of the treatment effect (as measured by dropouts/exclusions) were fully reported in 8 of the 10 no-treatment control trials and in 11 of the 18 placebo control trials, respectively.</P>

Further univariate metaregression analyses on other characteristics not specified a priori showed no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS PFs and length of follow-up (duration of study in years), prior prophylaxis, or dropout rate; however, the pooled estimated treatment effect was 17% greater (95% CI 3% to 31%; P = 0.018) in trials with no treatment rather than placebo control groups.</P>
<P>The pooled estimate of treatment effect on D(M)FS PF from the 10 trials (2808 participants) with a no-treatment control group was 0.38 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.52; P &lt; 0.0001), while that from the 15 placebo-controlled trials (5671 participants) was 0.21 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.28; P &lt; 0.0001). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity in the analysis of the 15 trials with placebo control groups (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 23 on 14 degrees of freedom, P = 0.07, I = 38%); heterogeneity was substantially less than that observed when all trials were included in the meta-analysis. Although this was a post hoc analysis and thus should be viewed with caution, we have decided to present the results of the D(M)FS PF meta-analyses subgrouped by type of control group, due to the clear influence of this covariate (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1 and <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2) .</P>

<P>We have presented the key findings for the primary outcomes in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The main aim of this review was to estimate the effects on caries of using fluoride gel in children compared to placebo or no treatment. In this updated review, we have included 3 new trials, giving us a total of 28 included trials published between 1967 and 2005. A total of 9140 children were randomised in these trials to fluoride gel or placebo/no treatment. Twenty-five trials contributed data for the permanent tooth surfaces meta-analysis: over 5670 children were included in the 15 trials comparing a fluoride gel with a placebo and over 2800 in the 10 trials comparing fluoride gel with no treatment. For the great majority of children, the fluoride gel received was acidulated phosphate fluoride. There was moderate quality evidence that fluoride gel has a caries-inhibiting effect in the permanent dentition of about 28% (95% CI 19% to 36%). We performed a meta-analysis of the three trials assessing the effect of fluoride gel on the primary dentition. This low quality evidence suggested that fluoride gel leads to a 20% (95% CI 1% to 38%) reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces; there was no heterogeneity in this estimate.</P>
<P>A secondary aim of this review was to examine whether there was any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness of fluoride gel and a number of factors including the initial level of caries severity, background exposure to fluoride, mode of use (operator versus self applied under supervision, and tray/paint versus brush/floss), frequency of use or fluoride concentration. We were unable to detect a clear relationship between any of these factors and the magnitude of the treatment effect despite substantial variation in these factors between trials. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Even a meta-analysis including 25 trials has very limited power to detect such relationships and, like all analyses of observational data, is subject to the problem of potential confounding. For some factors, such as 'background exposure to fluoride', there is, in addition, the problem of potential misclassification due to the poor quality of the reported data. We were forced to make a number of assumptions, for instance classifying 'use of fluoride toothpaste' for 13 of the studies on the basis of the year when the study was conducted. We also treated this as a dichotomous variable (before/after mid
-1970s), although it is likely that the use of fluoridated toothpaste gradually increased during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Similarly, we grouped exposure to fluoride in toothpaste and fluoride in water into a single dichotomous variable, which was likely to group studies whose participants had quite different levels of baseline exposure. These problems will bias any estimates of effect towards the null hypothesis.</P>
<P>Although we did not observe significantly higher treatment effect with self application of fluoride gels, nor with frequency of applications of fluoride gel greater than twice per year, it should be noted that studies assessing the self application of fluoride gels tended to employ higher frequencies of application. With the exception of one study where frequency of application was four times a year (<LINK REF="STD-Trubman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Trubman 1973</LINK>), the nine studies of self applied fluoride gel reported a frequency of application of five times a year or more. By contrast, the 17 studies where fluoride gel was professionally applied, with the exception of 1 study in which 5 consecutive daily or weekly applications in 1 year were performed (<LINK REF="STD-Shern-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Shern 1976</LINK>), reported a frequency of application of 4 times a year or less. Nevertheless, little/no difference of treatment effects should be expected between the once- and the twice-a-year frequency of application range with the traditional professionally applied mode of acidulated phosphate fluoride gel treatment, since such lower frequencies of application are considered. More robust investigations of these aspects of the intervention require direct, head-to-head comparisons of different frequencies of application, which were not within the scope of this review.</P>
<P>Subgroup and metaregression analyses showed that the effect of fluoride gel varied according to type of control group used, with D(M)FS PF on average being 17% (95% CI 3% to 31%; P = 0.018) higher in non-placebo-controlled trials; whether the study employed a placebo or a no-treatment control group was the only factor that was significantly related to heterogeneity of effect. Nevertheless, this was a post hoc analysis, and must be interpreted with caution given its observational nature, and the large number of other factors examined.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 23:02:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there is evidence that fluoride gel has a caries-inhibiting effect, we found little useful information about the effects of fluoride gels on a number of other clinically important outcomes such as acute side effects (nausea/vomiting) and on epidemiologically important outcomes such as the proportion of children developing caries or remaining caries-free. We found no information on other adverse effects such as tooth staining or oral allergic reactions. Only three studies measured adverse effects and reported that there were none. This scarcity of evidence about adverse effects makes it more difficult for clinicians and policymakers to weigh the benefits of fluoride gels in preventing caries against the possible shortcomings of the procedure. Data for unacceptability of the treatment regimen and the treatment effect (as measured indirectly by dropouts in no-treatment trials and exclusions in placebo-controlled trials) were more fully reported.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review used a variety of fluoride gel frequencies, methods, and techniques of application, and various fluoride agents and concentrations. In the studies with more than one relevant intervention group and a common control group, such as those comparing different active fluoride agents or concentrations of fluoride ions to a placebo group, we combined summary statistics from the studies (number of children analysed, mean caries increments, and standard deviations) from all relevant intervention groups in order to obtain a measure of treatment effect. This enabled the inclusion of all relevant data in the primary meta-analyses assessing the caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride gel on children&#8217;s permanent tooth surfaces, but has limited a secondary investigation of dose-response.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review were conducted with participants who were at differing levels of caries risk, as evidenced by the variability of the caries increments in the control groups, and who were based in different locations with variability in exposure to other sources of fluoride.</P>
<P>The caries increment prevented fraction appeared to be consistent across different populations, levels of caries risk and exposure to other fluoride sources. The absolute benefit from fluoride gel will, of course, depend on the expected caries increment in the target population. Where the expected caries increment is small, the absolute benefit of fluoride gel will be very small.</P>
<P>An important issue in this review is whether the body of evidence, which mainly consists of older studies with participants who were probably not exposed to fluoride toothpaste, is applicable today, when fluoridated toothpastes are widely available and use is generally high. Regarding this, we included three new studies in this update, and in two of them, which were well conducted and carried out in the Netherlands in the the early 2000s, the treatment effects observed where participants would have had lifetime use of fluoride toothpaste were very similar to the overall pooled results.</P>
<P>We have found little information about the adverse effects of topical fluoride gel; only two RCTs reported on this. Substantial information on a particular type of adverse effect (fluorosis) of topically applied fluoride treatments (especially toothpaste) can be found in a Cochrane review on topical fluoride and the risk of fluorosis (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>We assessed none of the trials included in this review as being at low risk of bias; most (20) were at high risk of bias. The domains most commonly found to be at high risk of bias were random sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and incomplete outcome data (attrition bias).</P>
<P>For the primary outcome, DMFS increment, we downgraded the quality of the evidence because of these limitations in study design (in particular, at least 85% of information was from studies with unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment, or both, and about 50% was from studies with no placebo use). We also observed substantial heterogeneity in the main outcome (DMFS increment) in this review, but the results consistently pointed to the caries-inhibiting effectiveness of fluoride gel in the permanent dentition, so we did not downgrade the quality of the evidence for inconsistency. In addition, a substantial amount of evidence could be included in the DMFS PF meta-analysis, and the size of treatment effect for the effectiveness outcomes (caries increment) was clinically important. We therefore consider the quality of evidence for the caries increment outcome for the permanent dentition to be moderate; we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the effect estimate, but there is a possibility that it could be substantially different. The evidence quality for the caries-preventive effect on the primary dentition, however, is low because only three trials reported the results of the effect on the primary dentition, and the applicability of these results was less certain.</P>
<P>Only 2 out of 28 studies reported on acute toxicity (490 participants). Both of these studies have serious limitations in their methodology, with either unclear or high risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. It is unclear whether the other studies measured this outcome at all, and so we cannot rule out a possibility of reporting bias. We downgraded further for imprecision because of the small number of events and participants. The quality of evidence for this outcome is therefore very low. Our confidence in the effect estimate is very limited, and further research is very likely to have an important impact and likely to change this estimate.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the number of dropouts in the studies, used as an outcome in this review, was also low. Apart from the limitations of study design, we also had concerns about selective reporting. Of the nine studies that did not report the dropout by study arm, six provided the total number of dropouts, and this ranged from 18% to 38%; we could not rule out differential dropout in these studies. Nevertheless, it is unclear how dropout as an outcome is linked to participant's acceptability of the treatment regimen, or adverse events experienced.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-03 11:26:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used a sensitive search strategy to identify trials for inclusion in this review and placed no restrictions on publication status or language. Many references were translated in order to determine whether or not they reported trials eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>We observed a degree of asymmetry in the funnel plot, which suggests an association between smaller studies and a lower estimate of treatment effect. Publication bias is usually reported to result in a lower probability of publication of small studies with negative effects, the reverse of what is observed here. This asymmetry was strongly influenced by a large study, which reported the largest positive effect. There may be other reasons for differences between the average effects in small and large studies, and this result may well represent the effects of confounding by other study characteristics.</P>
<P>As most of the included studies (25 out of 28) were published before the year 2000, the majority in the 1970s, most papers provided very little information in areas that are considered important for assessment of bias. This meant that we rated many studies as 'unclear'. In the assessment of selective reporting bias, we rated most studies as 'low', simply because there was no protocol and little information to suggest that there was selective reporting, and clinically it seems expected outcomes were reported. However, should more information be made available, this may not be the case. We rated all three newer studies (published after the year 2000) as unclear for selective reporting bias because information was provided to suggest that results were not reported exactly in the way planned.</P>
<P>We made a thorough attempt to investigate sources of heterogeneity in this review, examining factors related to participants, interventions, and study design quality. None of the a priori specified factors above were clearly related to heterogeneity. When we examined whether there was any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness of fluoride gel and a few other factors posed post hoc, we also found no significant associations for length of follow-up (duration of study in years), prior prophylaxis and dropout rate. The only factor that was significantly related to heterogeneity of effect was whether the study employed a placebo or a no-treatment control group. The latter group of studies was associated with a significant 17% greater estimate of treatment effect on the main outcome than those with a placebo control group (a finding that informed the way results were presented in both the original and this updated review). Blind assessment of outcome was an inclusion criterion for this review, but clearly participants could not have been blinded in trials with no-treatment controls. Although it is unclear why this should have been associated with differences in outcome in these particular circumstances, type of control group can be considered a useful 'proxy' for the use or not of double-blinding in included studies, a key methodological feature that probably represents the best indicator of study quality in this review. However, lack of blinding in outcome assessment was not a major criterion for exclusion of studies; we excluded only two studies for this reason alone - most studies had multiple features that met our exclusion criteria, such as lack of randomisation.</P>
<P>We also performed sensitivity analyses for the main meta-analysis to take into account the uncertainty we had about the imputations for the missing standard deviations; the clustering where this had not been done (in one cluster-randomised trial); and the uncertainty we had about the inclusion of trials at high risk of bias for allocation concealment and for blinding of outcome assessment. The sensitivity analyses showed similar results and levels of heterogeneity to those of the full meta-analysis, except for blind outcome assessment, where the effect estimate was smaller than the full meta-analysis and with a lower level of heterogeneity. The unchanged sensitivity analysis result obtained for the key domain of allocation concealment was possibly due to the fact that this process was poorly described in the studies included in general.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-27 23:10:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this updated Cochrane review did not differ from those of the initial review, published first in 2002. The general direction of findings presented is in keeping with those of other reviews (for example <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>), which also found evidence for the effectiveness of fluoride gel.</P>
<P>The estimate of caries reduction in this review remains very similar to that reported in the meta-analysis on the caries-preventive effect of fluoride gels from the late 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>), which found a pooled D(M)FS PF estimate of a 22% (95% CI 18% to 25%) reduction in caries increment. It is also similar to that reported in the most recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>), where treatment effects were presented as pooled D(M)FS standardised mean differences (SMD), and a pooled estimate of -0.25 (95% CI -0.33 to -0.16) was obtained (due to the character of D(M)FS data, mean caries increments are closely related to their standard deviations).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there were substantial differences in selection criteria and methods between the reviews, and consequently the number and types of studies included. Of the 19 studies included in the review by <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>, we did not include 10 in this review: in 4 of the these trials fluoride toothpaste in gel form was applied daily by toothbrush in standard concentrations (found in toothpastes) of less than 1500 ppm F, and the other 6 studies were excluded for a variety of reasons. We identified a further 13 studies for this review, including 4 published after the <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK> review (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselsson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Truin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Truin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rijkom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rijkom 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>As for the other review (<LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>), of the 12 studies included in its D(M)FS SMD meta-analysis, 11 were also included in this review; in the trial that did not meet the inclusion criteria for our review (<LINK REF="STD-Agrawal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Agrawal 2011</LINK>), only 2 schools were assigned by coin tossing to 1 of the 2 groups compared. We identified a further 13 studies for inclusion in this review, all published before the <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK> review.</P>
<P>This updated Cochrane review includes an additional three RCTs compared to the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>). None of these three included trials are thus included in the <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK> review, and one trial is included in the <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK> review (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The large body of evidence contained in this updated Cochrane review provides the best available evidence of the effectiveness of fluoride gel compared to either placebo or no treatment (the comparative effectiveness of topical-fluoride interventions is addressed in another review in this series (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2004</LINK>)).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-09 17:36:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggests that the application of fluoride gels, either by professionals or self applied, is associated with a large reduction in caries increment in permanent teeth in children (the quality of evidence is moderate). We are less certain of the large reduction observed in the primary dentition (low quality evidence). Unfortunately, there was little information on the risk of adverse effects with this treatment.</P>
<P>We found no evidence that this relative effect was dependent on the baseline caries level, or exposure to other fluoride sources in the population, or to application features such as mode/method or frequency of gel application, or fluoride concentration. We also found that this relative effect was not dependent on length of follow-up, whether a prophylaxis was undertaken prior to application of the gel, or according to dropout rate, although these results should be interpreted with caution (even a meta-analysis including 25 trials has very limited power to detect such relationships and, like all analyses of observational data, is subject to the problem of potential confounding). The effect of fluoride gel varied according to type of control group used, with larger caries reductions in non-placebo-controlled trials.</P>
<P>The evidence seems applicable to current clinical practice. For example, with regards to exposure to other fluoride sources in the population, although the evidence base for fluoride gel is mainly from older studies conducted when fluoridated toothpaste was not widely available, we have found no evidence of smaller treatment effects in the trials conducted more recently.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-27 22:38:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have identified a large number of trials, but the quality of the trials included in this review is relatively poor, with many reports lacking important methodological details. This is likely to be due in part to the fact that most of the trials are relatively old. Many characteristics considered crucial for excluding bias, such as clearly stated randomisation and allocation concealment, have been emphasised more in recent years, after most of the gel trials were reported. Researchers should pay particular attention to reporting the methods of randomisation and the history and reasons for dropouts and exclusions throughout the course of the study. Nevertheless, given the clarity of the results for the permanent dentition (and general lack of recommendation for fluoride gel use in young children), further randomised comparisons of fluoride gel and placebo/no treatment alone would be hard to justify.</P>
<P>If further trials are considered, head-to-head comparisons of fluoride gels and other caries-preventive strategies may provide more useful information. It is important that future trials should include the assessment of potential adverse effects and acceptability. Planning and conducting an economic analysis alongside the clinical trial may also be considered. The evaluation of possible differences in effect associated to fluoride gel application features, such as frequency of application, should be based on available/future trials that directly address the comparison of such features. Further trials should be well-designed RCTs (adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment methods, blinding of participants and outcome assessors) and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>). Core outcomes on the assessment of caries and impact of caries, which may be available through the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org">www.comet-initiative.org</A>) should be used.</P>

<P>In the 2015 update, we further defined the outcomes for clarity. We also trimmed the list of outcomes to those that are more relevant to patients. Use of health service resources (such as visits to dental-care units, length of dental treatment time) were not available from the studies and will no longer be collected. These data have limited applicability across settings.</P>
<P>Other changes implemented in this update are the addition of a full &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; assessment, and the development of a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table for the primary outcomes in the review.</P>
<P>Finally, there were changes in the investigations of heterogeneity performed through metaregression and subgroup analyses, and in the investigations of sensitivity analyses, including changes to the way a few covariates were analysed in each. We have reported these changes and the rationale for them in the relevant sections of the review.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>PF = 1 - (mean increment in control group/mean increment in treatment group) (expressed as percentages). PF values between 1% to 10% are considered to be a small effect; between 10% to 20%, a moderate effect; values above 20% are considered a large or substantial effect.</P>
<P>
<SUP>2 </SUP>Quality of evidence was downgraded because of the limitations in study design (at least 85% of information is from studies with unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment or both; about 50% are from studies with no placebo use). Although there was high statistical heterogeneity in this outcome, it was not further downgraded for inconsistency as results consistently showed a large clinical effect in caries reduction.</P>
<P>
<SUP>3 </SUP>More than 70% of information comes from a study at low risk of bias for key domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding. However, evidence was downgraded twice because only 3 out of 28 studies reported this information; there is concern about publication bias, imprecision of results and the relevance of this outcome to clinical practice.</P>
