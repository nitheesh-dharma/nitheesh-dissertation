<P>New search from June 2006 to December 2011. No new studies met the inclusion criteria. The Risk of Bias table has been updated for all included studies and 4 Summary of findings tables have been added to the updated review. In the 2007 version there were unintended errors in the data entered for withdrawals due to side effects for the two UK Medical Research Council trials (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1985,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MRCOA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRCOA 1992</LINK>), which led to the erroneous conclusion that patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects than those on diuretics. The corrected data, in this update, show no significant differences in withdrawals due to side effects between beta-blockers and diuretics. The overall message in the conclusions has not changed.</P>

<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess whether beta-blockers decrease the number of deaths, strokes, and heart attacks associated with high blood pressure in adults. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 13 relevant studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Are beta-blockers as good as other medicines when used for treatment of adults with high blood pressure?</B>
</P>
<P>Beta-blockers were not as good at preventing the number of deaths, strokes, and heart attacks as other classes of medicines such as diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Most of these findings come from one type of beta-blocker called atenolol. However, beta-blockers are a diverse group of medicines with different properties, and we need more well-conducted research in this area.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review? </B>
</P>
<P>Millions of people with high blood pressure have strokes, heart attacks, and other diseases, and many of them die. This situation could be prevented with appropriate treatment. Researchers have tried different medicines for treating high blood pressure.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 13 studies from high-income countries, mainly Western Europe and North America. In the studies, the people receiving beta-blockers were compared to people who received no treatment or other medicines. The studies showed the following.</P>
<P>Beta-blockers probably make little or no difference in the number of deaths among people on treatment for high blood pressure. This effect appears to be similar to that of diuretics and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, but beta-blockers are probably not as good at preventing deaths from high blood pressure as calcium-channel blockers.</P>
<P>Beta-blockers may reduce the number of strokes, an effect which appears to be similar to that of diuretics. However, beta-blockers may not be as good at preventing strokes as renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or calcium-channel blockers.</P>
<P>Beta-blockers may make little or no difference to the number of heart attacks among people with high blood pressure. The evidence suggests that this effect may not be different from that of diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, or calcium-channel blockers. However, among people aged 65 years and older, the evidence suggests that beta-blockers may not be as good at reducing heart attacks as diuretics.</P>
<P>People given beta-blockers are more likely to have side effects and stop treatment than people taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, but there may be little or no difference in side effects between beta-blockers and diuretics or calcium-channel blockers.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to June 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-10 04:12:42 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Beta-blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-02-05 16:16:51 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Vijaya M Musini">
<P>To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-17 13:00:53 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-12 07:50:34 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-10 04:13:37 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and conducted fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses, as appropriate. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. GRADE classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 04:26:31 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. They compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 RCTs, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 RCTs, 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: 4 RCTs, 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 RCTs, 10,828 participants). These RCTs were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta-blockers, three-quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol).</P>
<P>There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons.</P>
<P>Total CVD was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease (CHD: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence compared to diuretics (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or CCBs (low-certainty evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 04:37:10 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most outcome RCTs on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest CVD reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-10 05:11:55 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension is one of the leading causes of disability and premature deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-GBD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD 2015</LINK>). The rationale for treating hypertension achieved great impetus with the finding that even small reductions in blood pressure can significantly reduce associated morbidity and mortality risks (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staessen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staessen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomopoulos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomopoulos 2015</LINK>). The major classes of drugs for treating hypertension include beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-10 05:11:55 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Beta-blockers refer to a diverse group of drugs which block the action of endogenous catecholamines on beta-adrenergic receptors, part of the autonomic (or sympathetic) nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2007a</LINK>). The autonomic nervous system has been known to play a role in blood pressure control since 1949 (<LINK REF="REF-Smithwick-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithwick 1949</LINK>). The principal adrenergic receptors present in the human cardiovascular system are the &#946;1, &#946;2, and &#945;1 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Fergus-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergus 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pucci-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pucci 2016</LINK>). Beta-blockers vary in their &#946;1/&#946;2-adrenergic receptor selectivity and vasodilatory properties, and this diversity has given rise to their classification into first, second, and third generation. First-generation beta-blockers exercise identical affinity for &#946;1 and &#946;2 receptors and are thus classified as non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol). Second-generation beta-blockers are more attracted to &#946;1 than &#946;2 receptors, and are thus termed selective beta-blockers (e.g. atenolol). The third-generation of beta-blockers are known for their intrinsic vasodilatory properties (e.g. nebivolol) (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Beta-blockers have been used as first-line therapy for hypertension since the late 1960s, apparently because activation of the sympathetic nervous system is important in the aetiology and maintenance of hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC_x002d_6-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC-6 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larochelle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larochelle 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philipp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philipp 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2013</LINK>); but the robustness of the evidence for use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Messerli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messerli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opie-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2000</LINK>). From 2004 to 2006, three meta-analyses were published which found that beta-blockers were less effective in reducing the incidence of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>), and the composite of major cardiovascular outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>), compared to all drugs for treating hypertension. However, beta-blockers might have different comparative outcomes versus the various other classes of drugs. For instance, several studies have claimed that CCBs are better than other antihypertensive agents in preventing stroke but less good at preventing coronary heart disease (CHD; <LINK REF="REF-Angeli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angeli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdecchia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdecchia 2005</LINK>). Thus, it is important to know to what extent the comparisons made by Lindholm and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>) and Khan and co-authors (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuyper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyper 2014</LINK>) relate to beta-blockers versus specific classes of antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics, CCBs, or RAS inhibitors. RAS inhibitors refer to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitors (DRI). In general, beta-blockers might be better or worse than one specific class of drugs for specific endpoints so that comparing beta-blockers with all other classes could be misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>). In addition, the safety of a medication is as important to the clinician and the person as is the effectiveness; but neither Lindholm and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>) nor Khan and co-authors (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuyper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyper 2014</LINK>) provided data on this aspect when comparing beta-blockers to other antihypertensive agents (see also <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Proper understanding of the evidence for beta-blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which re-assessed the place of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The current review is an update of the 2012 review.</P>

<P>For the current update, two review authors (CSW and HB) independently examined the eligibility of all titles and abstracts of studies identified by electronic or bibliographic scanning. The two review authors then independently assessed the risk of bias within included studies and extracted data. At each stage, the they resolved differences by discussion and consensus. If any discrepancies had persisted, JV would have arbitrated.</P>
<P>We assessed the risk of bias by addressing seven specific domains, as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The seven domains were random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias'. For each included study, we described what the study authors reported that they did for each domain and then made a decision relating to the risk of bias for that domain; by assigning a judgement of 'low risk' of bias, 'high risk' of bias, or 'unclear risk' of bias.</P>
<P>The data extracted for each study were: methods, including means of assigning participants to trial interventions, blinding of those receiving and providing care and outcome assessors, losses to follow-up and how they were handled, and length of trial follow-up; participant characteristics, including gender, ethnicity and comorbid conditions; interventions, including type and dose of beta-blocker and other medications used; outcome measures, including morbidity and mortality endpoints, and adverse events.</P>
<P>We conducted quantitative analyses according to standard Cochrane guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We analysed trial participants in groups to which they were randomised, regardless of which or how much treatment they actually received, and expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed heterogeneity between studies by graphical inspection of results and, more formally followed by, the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of homogeneity. In the absence of significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (P &gt; 0.1), we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect method (<LINK REF="REF-Breslow-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breslow 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>). When there was significant heterogeneity between study results, we used the random-effects method (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>), and investigated the cause of heterogeneity by stratified analysis with reference to the characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis. The study characteristics considered in the subgroup analyses were age (less than 65 years versus 65 years and older), type of beta-blockade (cardioselective versus non-selective), control group (placebo versus no treatment), and risk of bias (high versus low risk of bias). In addition, we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to describe the percentage of between-study variability in effect estimates (for each outcome) attributable to true heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various related reviews differ from ours in their inclusion or exclusion of various studies (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dahl_x00f6_f-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlöf 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>).

<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-AASK-2002" TYPE="STUDY">AASK 2002</LINK>. This RCT compared the effects of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), a CCB (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) on hypertensive renal disease progression in African American people aged 18 to 70 years. Additional antihypertensive agents were added sequentially to achieve blood pressure goals. Cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality. and all-cause mortality were reported. The trial followed 1094 participants for a mean duration of 4.1 years.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-ASCOT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ASCOT 2005</LINK>. The participants were randomised to a CCB (amlodipine) adding an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) as required to reach blood pressure targets or a beta-blocker (atenolol) adding a diuretic (bendroflumethiazide) as required. The participants were men and women with hypertension aged 40 to 79 years. The main outcome measure was combined non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD, and secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and total stroke. At the end of the trial, 78% of participants were taking at least two antihypertensive medications and only 15% were taking amlodipine and 9% were taking atenolol monotherapy. The study enrolled 19,257 participants and followed them for a median duration of 5.5 years.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1981</LINK>. This RCT evaluated the long-term effects of a thiazide diuretic (bendroflumethiazide) compared to a beta-blocker (propranolol) in men with hypertension aged 47 to 54 years. Hydralazine and other antihypertensive medications were added to achieve blood pressure goals. The investigators reported total mortality. At the end of the trial, 70% of participants taking diuretic and 74% taking beta-blockers were on assigned treatment and 40% of participants taking diuretic and 42% taking beta-blocker were on monotherapy. The study enrolled 106 participants and the study lasted 10 years.</LI>

<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1986</LINK>. The trial was designed to determine whether the treatment of hypertension using beta-blocker therapy (atenolol) in a stepped-care approach compared to no treatment reduced the incidence of stroke, CHD, cardiovascular death, or all-cause mortality. Step one was monotherapy with atenolol, step two added a thiazide diuretic (bendrofluazide), and steps three and four added other antihypertensive agents. At the end of the trial, 70% of participants in the beta-blocker group were taking assigned treatment, 17% were taking atenolol alone, and 53% were taking atenolol plus bendrofluazide. The trial followed up 884 participants aged 60 to 79 years for a mean duration of 4.4 years.</LI>

<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-ELSA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ELSA 2002</LINK>. The trial was designed to compare the effects of a beta-blocker (atenolol) and a CCB (lacidipine) on the change in mean maximum intima-media thickness and plaque number in men and women with hypertension. The investigators also reported data on fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and total mortality. If satisfactory blood pressure control was not achieved, trial medication could be increased, and when necessary open-label hydrochlorothiazide was added. At the end of the trial, 85% of participants in the beta-blocker group and 78% in the CCB group were known to be on assigned treatment. The participants on monotherapy at the end of the trial were 43% in the beta-blocker group and 42% in the CCB group. The trial followed up 2334 participants aged 45 to 75 years for a mean duration of 3.75 years.</LI>

<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>. The trial was designed to compare the effect of a CCB (verapamil sustained release, SR), and a beta-blocker (atenolol) in hypertensive participants with documented coronary artery disease, on all-cause and cardiovascular death, and various non-fatal cardiovascular events. Other drugs, mainly trandolapril (to the verapamil SR group) and hydrochlorothiazide (to the atenolol group), were added to achieve blood pressure control as required. At two years, 77.5% of participants in the beta-blocker group and 81.5% in the CCB group were on the assigned treatment (18.1% taking beta-blocker and 17.4% taking CCB monotherapy). The trial followed up 22,576 participants aged 50 years and older for a mean duration of 2.7 years.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002d_39_x002d_1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS-39-1998</LINK>. The trial was designed to determine whether tight control of blood pressure with either a beta-blocker (atenolol) or an ACE inhibitor (captopril) prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications in participants with type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomised to study drugs, with other drugs added as required. At the end of the trial, 65% of participants in the beta-blocker group and 78% in the ACE inhibitor group were on assigned treatment. The trial followed up 758 participants aged 25 to 65 years for 8.4 years.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-VA-COOP-1982" TYPE="STUDY">VA COOP 1982</LINK>. This trial compared a beta-blocker (propranolol) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) for the initial treatment of hypertension in men aged 21 to 65 years. During treatment, fewer participants receiving hydrochlorothiazide required termination as compared with men receiving propranolol. A total of 683 men were recruited. During the initial 10 weeks (i.e. dose-finding period), the clinic staff titrated the blinded drug upward until the target blood pressure was reached. Participants were withdrawn from the study if, on any follow-up visit, diastolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg or more. The trial lasted one year.</LI>

<P>Expressed as absolute risk reduction (ARR), beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke by 0.5% (compared to placebo). The corresponding number of participants needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with a beta-blocker for approximately five years to prevent one stroke was 200.</P>

<P>There was significant statistical heterogeneity between trials comparing beta-blockers to diuretics (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 66%, P = 0.03), which may be explained by differences in age. The pooled RR in the trials whose participants were less than 65 years of age was 0.97 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.17, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 5%, P = 0.35), while in the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32) (<LINK REF="STD-MRCOA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRCOA 1992</LINK>).

<P>The significant heterogeneity of effect on total cardiovascular disease between beta-blockers and RAS inhibitors (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 74%, P = 0.02) was explained by the effect of beta-blockers being similar to that of ACE inhibitors (2 trials, 635 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.05, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) but worse than that of an ARB (1 trial, 9193 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.30) with an ARI of 1.8% and NNTH of 56.</P>

<P>We included 13 eligible RCTs, which compared beta-blockers to placebo, diuretics, CCBs, and RAS inhibitors. These RCTs generally had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis.</P>
<P>We found little or no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo, diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but all-cause mortality was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs. The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons. Total cardiovascular disease was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo, which is a reflection of the significant decrease in stroke, since there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and placebo. There were no significant differences between beta-blockers and placebo in adverse events leading to withdrawal from assigned treatment (low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>The effect of beta-blockers on cardiovascular disease was worse than that of CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In addition, there was an increase in stroke with beta-blockers compared to CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence), or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (moderate-certainty evidence), but there was no significant difference with diuretics (low-certainty evidence) or CCBs (low certainty evidence).</P>
<P>We demonstrated a high degree of homogeneity of effect for the comparisons of beta-blockers versus CCBs for all-cause mortality (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 2%), stroke (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), and total cardiovascular events (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) but with less homogeneity for CHD (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 32%). For the comparison of beta-blockers versus RAS inhibitors, the I<SUP>2</SUP> values for stroke and withdrawal rates also demonstrate a high degree of consistency across the studies making our conclusions more secure (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-12 04:43:29 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Though beta-blockers are a heterogeneous group of pharmacological agents, differing in beta-adrenergic receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and vasodilatory capabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Kamp-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamp 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pol_x00f3_nia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polónia 2010</LINK>), we found no outcome trials with head-to-head comparisons between beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Poirier-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poirier 2014</LINK>). Of the 40,245 participants using beta-blockers in this review, atenolol was used by 30,150 participants (75%). Due to the paucity of data using beta-blockers other than atenolol, it is not possible to say whether the (lack of) effectiveness and (in)tolerability of beta-blockers seen in this review is a property of atenolol or is a class effect of beta-blockers. From this review, we cannot support the claim by Lindhom and colleagues that cardioselective beta-blockers may be inferior to non-selective beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A limitation of both previous reviews and ours is the absence of trials assessing the effects of the new vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. carvedilol, bucindolol, and nebivolol) on mortality and hard cardiovascular outcomes. Possible mechanisms to explain the poor ability of beta-blockers to reduce stroke include a propensity to cause diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Opie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opie 2004</LINK>), a failure to decrease central aortic pressure as much as brachial pressure, and others. Diabetes likely requires years to develop cardiovascular complications (<LINK REF="REF-Verdecchia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdecchia 2004</LINK>), so we favour the mechanism involving lesser reduction of central aortic pressure by beta-blockers. Vasodilating beta-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Broeders-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broeders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalinowski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalinowski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pucci-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pucci 2016</LINK>) have been shown to reduce central pressures better than conventional beta-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Kamp-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamp 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pol_x00f3_nia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polónia 2010</LINK>); most probably because vasodilatation favourably alters the pattern of the pressure wave reflecting back from the periphery, thereby lowering the central pressure. Nonetheless, carvedilol and nebivolol also cause bradycardia, which is thought to be the principal mechanism whereby atenolol with or without thiazide may be less able to lower the central pressure than amlodipine with or without perindopril (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>). At any rate, high-quality outcome studies are required to show that hard cardiovascular endpoints such as stroke and CHD are significantly reduced by beta-blockers not studied in this review.</P>
<P>Information reported in the trials considered in this review was insufficient to explore the effect of race or ethnicity, as most trial participants were white (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2007</LINK>). However, the finding that beta-blockers are less effective than diuretics in older people, is most likely to be applicable to older black people as well (<LINK REF="REF-Materson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Materson 1993</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-12 04:57:02 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The certainty of the evidence on the effects of beta-blockers was generally moderate to low (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>). In the GRADE system, RCTs without important limitations constitute high-certainty evidence. However, the system considers five factors that can lower the certainty of the evidence: study limitations, heterogeneity, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Overall, the GRADE system classifies research evidence into high-, moderate-, low-, or very low-certainty. Low-certainty evidence implies that the "true effect is likely to be different from the estimate of effect" found in the review.</P>
<P>Our major concern with the evidence related to inherent shortcomings in the included primary studies. The emphasis was often on the results with the first drug used, whereas most studies used stepped-up therapy to help achieve the blood pressure goals. Thus poorer outcomes with first-line beta-blockers may equally have resulted from the use of other drugs; explaining why other authors restricted their systematic reviews of beta-blocker therapy to trials where confounding supplementary drug classes were administered to less than half of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>). Although we were less restrictive than Wright and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2000</LINK>), we included only trials in which all the participants in one group received a beta-blocker at baseline, whether or not other antihypertensive drug classes were later added to achieve blood pressure targets. This requirement was in contrast to other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dahl_x00f6_f-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlöf 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>). The dropout rates were high in two of the studies of diuretics, potentially introducing attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRCOA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRCOA 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>It may be that only people with complicated hypertension or advanced disease are included in most studies, thereby ignoring the possible differing benefits of different antihypertensive medications on different organs and on different stages of disease development (<LINK REF="REF-Zanchetti-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanchetti 2005</LINK>). A further problem is that in the two groups of the studies we analysed, and especially in the case of the comparison with diuretics, there were discrepancies between the achieved blood pressure levels (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), and even small blood pressure differences may be linked to significant differences in outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staessen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staessen 2003</LINK>). However, there were no consistent differences in the blood pressure reduction between beta-blockers and the other agents used to explain the outcome differences we found (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Yet another limitation is that (due to the scarcity of relevant trials) we combined the potentially different classes of RAS inhibitors (i.e. ACE inhibitors (captopril and lisinopril) and ARB (losartan). However, we believe that the similarities between these agents as antihypertensive drugs outweigh any potential differences.</P>

<P>We minimised potential biases in the review process by adhering to the Cochrane guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in each included study.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-12 05:01:06 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We showed that beta-blockers are inferior to various CCBs for all-cause mortality, stroke, and total cardiovascular events, and to RAS inhibition for stroke. By comparing beta-blockers with all other therapies, Lindholm and colleagues were only able to show an inferiority of beta-blockade on stroke reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>). In a similar meta-analysis, Khan and McAlister found beta-blockers to be inferior to all other therapies in effects on a composite outcome of major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) and stroke for older people with hypertension but found no difference in effects for younger people (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>). The claim by <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK> that the defects of beta-blockade are limited to older people relies heavily on the Medical Research Council trial in older people with hypertension in which the beta-blocker was atenolol and where the dropout rate was 25% (<LINK REF="STD-MRCOA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRCOA 1992</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK> classified trials which enrolled participants as young as 40 (<LINK REF="STD-ASCOT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ASCOT 2005</LINK>), 45 (<LINK REF="STD-ELSA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">ELSA 2002</LINK>), and 50 (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>) years as trials of older people with hypertension. At present, there are insufficient data to make a valid comparison of beta-blocker effects on younger versus older people, although this is an important hypothesis.</P>
<P>We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to evaluate the consistency in study results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In our meta-analyses, heterogeneity was very low for the outcomes of beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment. We found a modest 20% relative reduction in stroke by beta-blockers compared to placebo with six studies, which is similar to the relative reduction reported by Lindholm and colleagues using seven studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>). With their wider inclusion criteria, Lindholm and colleagues included three studies not considered by us (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-TIA-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch TIA 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TEST-1995" TYPE="STUDY">TEST 1995</LINK>), which resulted in significant heterogeneity of effect in their findings. By contrast, there was excellent homogeneity of effect with the four studies included in our comparison of beta-blockers to placebo as shown by an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 0% (<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IPPPSH-1985" TYPE="STUDY">IPPPSH 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRCOA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRCOA 1992</LINK>). Thus, we were able to give additional validation to one of the crucial findings of Lindholm and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhom 2005</LINK>), namely that stroke reduction by beta-blockade is suboptimal.</P>
<P>Two other reviews also differed from ours in their inclusion or exclusion of various studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dahl_x00f6_f-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlöf 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>). Both considered the <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002d_39_x002d_1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS-39-1998</LINK> as a placebo-controlled trial and excluded <LINK REF="STD-IPPPSH-1985" TYPE="STUDY">IPPPSH 1985</LINK>. In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK> excluded <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1986</LINK> because of high use of diuretics in the beta-blocker group while <LINK REF="REF-Dahl_x00f6_f-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlöf 2007</LINK> included <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1991</LINK> because more than 85% of participants on active treatment received beta-blocker as first-line or second-line therapy. Both reviews considered the "less tight control group" in <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002d_39_x002d_1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS-39-1998</LINK> as "placebo" because the target for blood pressure reduction in this group was not as low as in the beta-blocker group. However, participants in this control group took antihypertensive treatment for 57% of their total person-years in the <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002d_39_x002d_1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS-39-1998</LINK> trial. </P>
<P>We combined trials of low-dose and high-dose thiazide diuretics because of the paucity of trials comparing beta-blockers to diuretics (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HAPPHY-1987" TYPE="STUDY">HAPPHY 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRCOA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRCOA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA-COOP-1982" TYPE="STUDY">VA COOP 1982</LINK>). This may be the reason for the lack of a statistical difference between beta-blockers and diuretics in our review, since Wright and Musini have shown that first-line low-dose thiazides reduce stroke, CHD, and mortality outcomes while first-line high-dose thiazides have no significant effects on mortality and CHD (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses and found our results to be consistent with those of the related reviews, despite differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria (<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>). Overall, despite a variation in the studies included in other beta-blocker reviews arising from different interpretations of inclusion criteria, all the reviews arrived at similar conclusions that the available evidence does not support the use of beta-blockers as first-line drugs in the treatment of hypertension.</P>

<P>First-line beta-blockers in people with hypertension lead to modest reductions in stroke and have no significant effects on total mortality and coronary heart disease. In addition, beta-blockers are inferior to calcium-channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors for various important outcomes. Most of this evidence is considered to be of low quality according to the GRADE system, implying that further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of these effects. However, the evidence comes mainly from trials that used atenolol. Our findings extend the results of previous meta-analyses suggesting that beta-blockers are inferior first-line choices when compared to diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-12 05:01:30 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More randomised controlled trials studying the use of beta-blockers for elevated blood pressure are required. Such hypertension trials must measure clearly defined morbidity and mortality endpoints, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. These trials should be used to define differences between beta-blockers and other classes of antihypertensive drugs and between the different subclasses of beta-blockers. In addition, the possible differential effect of beta-blockers on younger and older people needs to be assessed in future hypertension trials.</P>

<P>We have decided to have clearly defined strict eligibility criteria regarding duration of treatment, which we have now set at one year or more on trial medications. In the protocol and initial version of the review published in 2007, duration of treatment was not included as a criterion for eligibility. We have now used the 'Risk of bias' tool as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

After 2 weeks of treatment, study participants were routinely started on an ACE inhibitor with or without a diuretic irrespective of whether they had normal BP or hypertension, unless they were deemed to be unsuitable for such therapy. Decisions with regard to future antihypertensive therapy were delayed until the end of the trial intervention (2 weeks). The proportion of participants on assigned treatment at the end of the study was 71% in the beta-blocker group, 68% in the ACE inhibitor group, and 80% in the placebo group. 172 participants, with mean age 74 years, were enrolled and the study reported mortality data at 3 months.

<P>This RCT was conducted in 85 centres in China, Germany, India, South Africa, Spain, and Turkey. People with hypertension (defined as mean sitting DBP 95 mmHg to 110 mmHg) were randomised to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg (231 participants), atenolol 50 mg (231 participants), or the combination (150/50 mg; 232 participants) for 6 weeks, followed by a further 6 weeks on double the initial doses of aliskiren and atenolol. Aliskiren is the first direct renin inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of hypertension. The proportion of participants on assigned treatment at the end of the study was 92.2% in the beta-blocker group, 91.3% in the direct renin inhibitor group, and 88.4% in the combination group. The trial followed up 694 participants (mean age 55.2 years, 23% aged &#8805; 65 years) for 12 weeks.
