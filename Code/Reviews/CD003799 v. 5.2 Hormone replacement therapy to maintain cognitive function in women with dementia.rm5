<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-26 20:59:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After the menopause, in women levels of estrogens decline. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or replacement therapy with both estrogens and progestagens (hormone replacement therapy or HRT) might theoretically help to maintain cognitive function in postmenopausal women with dementia. We therefore investigated the results of randomized controlled trials of the effects of ERT and HRT on cognitive function in postmenopausal women with AD.</P>
<P>Overall, however, there was no evidence for positive effects of ERT or HRT which was sustained after two months of treatment. This is similar to results of studies of ERT and HRT in women without dementia, which additionally found that HRT increases the rate of dementia in women over 65 years.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-25 12:09:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>As estrogens have been shown to have several potentially beneficial effects on the central nervous system, it is biologically plausible that maintaining high levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women by means of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) could be protective against cognitive decline in women with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementia syndromes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To investigate the effects of ERT (estrogens only) or HRT (estrogens combined with a progestagen) compared with placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cognitive function of postmenopausal women with dementia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, which contains records from many medical databases, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS were searched on 7 November 2007 using the terms ORT, PORT, ERT, HRT, estrogen*, oestrogen* and progesterone*. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into the effect of ERT or HRT for cognitive function with a treatment period of at least two weeks in postmenopausal women with AD or other types of dementia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Abstracts of the references retrieved by the searches were read by two reviewers (EH and KY) independently in order to discard those that were clearly not eligible for inclusion. The two reviewers studied the full text of the remaining references and independently selected studies for inclusion. Any disparity in the ensuing lists was resolved by discussion with all reviewers in order to arrive at the final list of included studies. The selection criteria ensured that the blinding and randomization of the included studies was adequate. The two reviewers also assessed the quality of other aspects of the included trials. One reviewer (EH) extracted the data from the studies, but was aided and checked by JB from Cochrane.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-26 21:00:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of seven trials including 351 women with AD were analysed. Because different drugs were used at different studies it was not possible to combine more than two studies in any analysis.</P>
<P>On a clinical global rating, clinicians scored patients taking CEE as significantly worse compared with the placebo group on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale after 12 months (overall WMD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.69, z = 1.99, P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>Patients taking CEE had a worse performance on the delayed recall of the Paragraph Test (overall WMD = -0.45, 95% CI = -0.79 to -0.11, z = 2.60, P &lt; 0.01) after one month than those taking placebo. They had a worse performance on Finger Tapping after 12 months (WMD = -3.90, 95% CI = -7.85 to 0.05, z = 1.93, P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>Limited positive effects were found for the lower dosage of CEE (0.625 mg/day) which showed a significant improvement in MMSE score only when assessed at two months, and disappeared after correction for multiple testing. No significant effects for MMSE were found at longer end points (3, 6 and 12 months of treatment). With a dosage of 1.25 mg/d CEE, short-term significant effects were found for Trial-Making test B at one month and Digit Span backward at four months. After two months of transdermal diestradiol (E2) treatment, a highly significant effect was observed for the word recall test (WMD = 6.50, 95% CI = 4.04 to 8.96, z = 5.19, P &lt; 0.0001). No other significant effects were found for other outcomes measured. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-25 16:34:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Nearly all cognitive functions decline, on average, with age, but there is a large variability which ranges from "successful" aging to dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Huppert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huppert 1997</LINK>). The determinants of this variability are uncertain but elderly women seem to have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) than elderly men (<LINK REF="REF-Launer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Launer 1999</LINK>). While this may be because they reach an older age, and aging is a risk factor for AD, the age-specific incidence of AD is also higher in women than in men (<LINK REF="REF-Fratiglioni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fratiglioni 2000</LINK>). It has been suggested that sex steroid hormone deficiencies in elderly women may play a role in this difference.</P>
<P>Estrogens (UK spelling oestrogens) are steroid hormones produced in women by the ovaries. The estrogen-producing cells become depleted at menopause, and postmenopausal women have much lower estrogen levels than men. In men, and in women after the menopause, the main source of estrogens is from conversion of circulating androgen steroid hormone precursors. In women, the main source of androgen steroids are the ovaries (theca cells) and the adrenal cortex, whereas in men it is the testes. Estrogens have an important role in the female reproductive cycle, but animal and in vivo cell studies have suggested that estrogens can have beneficial effects on brain structures including those related to memory, such as the hippocampus and basal cholinergic forebrain (<LINK REF="REF-McEwen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwen 1997</LINK>). There appear to be a variety of mechanisms involved in this process, including anti-amyloidgenic effects, antioxidant effects, dendritic sprouting and effects on various neurotransmitters involved in cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Silva-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEwen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that maintaining high levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women by means of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or combined therapy with estrogens and progestagens (hormone replacement therapy - HRT) could be protective against cognitive decline and the development of AD or other dementia syndromes. Post-menopausal ERT or HRT is usually prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes (UK hot flushes) and night sweats. For hysterectomized postmenopausal women, replacement therapy is usually given as ERT but HRT is prescribed for postmenopausal women with a uterus to reduce the risk of endometrial hypertrophy and cancer. ERT use has been associated with an increased risk of breast as well as uterine cancer (but see <LINK REF="REF-Col-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Col 2001</LINK>) and after the results of WHIMS were published (<LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 2004</LINK>), paradoxically now also with a doubled risk of dementia in women &gt; 65 years (see discussion).</P>
<P>Most observational studies, however, suggested that the use of ERT and HRT is associated with a decreased risk of AD (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaffe-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaffe 1998a</LINK>), but observational studies are subject to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett-Connor 1991</LINK>). For instance, women who choose to use ERT or HRT after the menopause in general have a higher education, healthier life-styles and are also healthier before using ERT or HRT than women who do not chose to use ERT or HRT (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1996</LINK>). Taking ERT or HRT is thus associated with a healthier life style, which in turn can decrease the risk for dementia. In addition, despite estrogen's biologically plausible mechanisms for protecting the aging brain, two earlier reviews concluded that the human studies had substantial methodological problems and had produced conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaffe-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaffe 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The present review assesses the evidence for effectiveness of ERT or HRT in treating the cognitive impairments of postmenopausal women with dementia. The evidence for effects of ERT or HRT on cognitive function in healthy postmenopausal women has been the subject of another review (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Abstracts of the references retrieved by the search were read by two reviewers (EH and KY) in order to discard those that were clearly not eligible for inclusion. The two reviewers studied the full text of the remaining references and independently selected studies for inclusion. Any disparity in the ensuing lists was resolved by discussion with all reviewers in order to arrive at the final list of included studies. One reviewer (EH) extracted the data from the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers assessed the quality of the studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines which focus on the allocation of treatment.</P>
<P>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, and opaque; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a "list" or "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or "sealed envelopes"; (iii) stating the study as "randomized" without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown liable to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but the bias is less pronounced than in inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other aspects of the trial quality (methodology, statistics) were noted for the discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Data for the meta-analyses were based on reported summary statistics for each study.</P>
<P>To test cognitive change after treatment, the main outcome of interest was the change from baseline to final assessment (mean difference in performance and SD of the mean difference in performance). The baseline assessment was defined as the last available assessment prior to randomization.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analyses were performed on the mean difference of the continuous psychometric test scores. The mean difference was calculated as the difference between post-treatment and baseline performance. The standard deviation (SD) of this difference was calculated as the square root of the variance of the baseline plus the variance of the final assessment (assuming the covariance between baseline and post-treatment values is 0) as advised in Cochrane Collaboration guidelines unless data could be extracted. For studies that used the same treatment and the test outcome measure, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was employed in the meta-analyses. In these analyses a fixed-effect model was used if significant heterogeneity was not detected. If significant heterogeneity was detected (using chi-square statistics), a possible explanation was sought and both fixed- and random-effects models were reported. When I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt;50%, a sensitivity analysis will be performed. For studies that had employed different types of treatment or had used different tests but measured the same construct (e.g. visual memory), the standardized mean difference (SMD) was used with either fixed-effect (when using the same test) or random-effects models (when using a different test but measuring the same construct).</P>
<P>The null hypothesis tested was that, for any of the above outcomes, treatment had no effect in comparison with placebo.</P>

<P>Nine double-blind placebo-controlled trials of postmenopausal women with dementia were identified (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). However, in two (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-Caldwell-1952" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald Caldwell 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Honjo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Honjo 1995</LINK>) there was insufficient information about the randomization procedure. In accordance with the Cochrane guidelines, these studies were excluded from analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subjects - screening and selection</HEADING>
<P>The total number of participants randomized in the trials varied from 14 to 120. In total, 351 women with dementia were included (266 had completed the studies) with an average of 38 participants per study. Drop-outs were described in four studies (but not in <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>: although data provided by the investigator suggested no drop-outs): 21/176 of treated women (11%) dropped out compared with 13/131 of placebo users (10%) for a wide variety of reasons, mostly unrelated to the medication.<BR/>
<BR/>Most studies required very rigorous health screening (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>) had less rigorous criteria (age &lt; 70, depression, non-AD dementia syndromes) and was a preliminary analysis on 20 subjects which was published in a general article on estrogen and hormonal replacement therapy. No follow-up of these data (or a more detailed description of the study) has been reported. Power analyses had been carried out by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>) but were not mentioned in the smaller studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>) while <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK> also failed to mention power analysis but would (on the basis of the calculations of the first two studies) have had sufficient numbers (n = 50).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subjects - dementia assessment</HEADING>
<P>Most studies reported inclusion of people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), except in <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK> where patients had non-AD dementia syndromes. Most studies employed the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD (but see <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>, where no criteria were given) and participants were in general considered to have mild to moderate dementia (MMSE between 10 and 28).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subjects - age and other confounding factors</HEADING>
<P>The mean age of the women with AD was 75 years old, but some studies had a large age-range (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>: range 56 to 91) and had thus included early and late onset AD. In one study only early age-onset AD patients (&lt; 63 years of age) were included with mild AD (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>). Age, education and depression were usually not controlled for in the analyses. Some studies included only women who had undergone natural menopause (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>) while others included mixed groups of surgically and naturally menopausal women (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>) or did not provide data on this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>All studies used a parallel-group design. Duration of treatment varied from eight weeks to 12 months, with an average of 4.4 months. We did not include the five week treatment time point of <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK> as the authors pointed out that data may not have been reliable, since two (of 12) participants had been tested elsewhere.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cognitive assessments</HEADING>
<P>Not all studies used similar cognitive tests which made comparison difficult. One of the problems in the otherwise well designed studies by <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK> was, for instance, that no common test of verbal memory was used. Verbal memory has been thought likely to be most sensitive cognitive test to the effects of estrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different types of treatment and estradiol levels</HEADING>
<P>Four RCTs prescribed Premarin (CEE produced by Wyeth). Of these, three used the 1.25 mg/day dosage (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>) and two employed the lower dosage of 0.625 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK> also added a progestagen to the estrogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) an Chinese estrogenic compound was used (Beimeili) containing conjugated oestrogen, which was also manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst in the USA and which was thought to probably be similar to CEE. Unfortunately little information could be found about this product which seems to be marketed mainly in China. Two studies used transdermal estradiol (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>). Compliance checks were done using pill counts (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>) or serum estrogen checks (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK> gave no data on compliance checks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistics</HEADING>
<P>Some studies reported separate within-group comparisons for participants in treatment and placebo groups (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) which can result in chance accumulation and a risk of the type I error. Five studies had performed 'completers' analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK> but data not shown) and three had performed 'intention-to-treat' analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Global cognitive functioning</HEADING>
<P>There was an overall positive effect for treatment on the MMSE score after 1 to 2 months with the combined low and high dosages (0.625 and 1.25 mg) CEE (WMD = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.06 to 1.94, z = 2.09, P &lt; 0.05, test for heterogeneity, P = 1.00). However, this was the only test that showed a dosage effect: after two months the low dosage, but not the 1.25 mg dosage, was significantly better than placebo. The positive effect of the low dose on MMSE performance did not persist after six and 12 months. In addition, this effect is clinically irrelevant as there was only a one-point difference on the MMSE between placebo and treatment. There was also no evidence for an overall short-term effect of treatment on the MMSE score (P = 0.15), when the E2 transdermal treatment was included in the analyses. The test for heterogeneity was not significant (P = 0.27) and there was no difference using SMD with a fixed- or random-effects model, suggesting that combining treatments did not violate prior assumptions of the analyses. The effect of combined CEE treatment (low and high dosage) on the MMSE score was not significant after 3, 6 and 12 months (P &gt; 0.50). There was no evidence of an effect of treatment on the ADAS-Cog after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of combined (0.625 mg + 1.25 mg) CEE treatment (P &gt; 0.10). There was also no evidence of an effect of treatment (E2 and 0.625 mg CEE) on the BIMC after two and nine months (P &gt; 0.30) and the tests for heterogeneity were not significant (P = 0.35). There was an overall effect of treatment on the HSD-R after four months of treatment (WMD = 6.09, 95% CI = 0.98 to 11.20, z = 2.34, P &lt; 0.05) in the early onset AD cases (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) when conjugated estrogen was compared to vitamin B1 treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Memory tests</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant effect of E2 transdermal or 1.25 mg CEE treatment on the immediate Paragraph Recall test (P &gt; 0.15). However, controls had a slightly better performance after one month than 1.25 mg CEE users on the delayed Paragraph Recall test (WMD = -0.45, 95% CI = -0.79 to 10.11, z = 2.60, P &lt; 0.01). There was a trend for a reversal of this effect after four months (P = 0.07). There was no evidence of a treatment effect on the BSRT immediate recall after two months of E2 transdermal treatment (P = 0.80). When these results were combined with that of another study of this research group using a combined measure of the immediate and delayed recall (derived from graphs), also no overall effect of two months treatment with transdermal E2 was detected (SMD random effects = 0.42, 95% CI = -0.29 to 1.12, z = 1.16, P = 0.25). However, the BSRT cued delayed recall was significantly better after two months of E2 transdermal than after placebo (WMD = 6.50, 95% CI = 4.04 to 8.96, z = 5.19, P &lt; 0.0001). Performance on the CERAD word list (P = 0.60) and on the Paired Associate learning test (P = 0.16) were unchanged after nine months of 0.625 mg CEE + MPA compared to placebo.</P>
<P>There was a trend (P = 0.07) for controls to have a better performance on Digit Span forward after four to nine months of CEE treatment (P = 0.09 for the four months treatment with 1.25 mg CEE, and P = 0.50 for the nine months treatment with 0.625 mg CEE + MPA). Differences in Category Fluency performance were in the same direction, but were also not significantly different (P = 0.11) for controls compared with CEE treatment after combined (0.625 + 1.25 mg) analyses after four (P = 0.82) and 12 months (P = 0.08) of treatment. Heterogeneity tests were not significant (Digit Span: P = 0.74 Fluency: P = 0.44) for these analyses.<BR/>
<BR/>No evidence for a treatment effect was detected on visual memory tests, e.g. on the VRT after one and four months of 1.25 mg CEE (P = 0.90); or on the VRT after two months of E2 transdermal (P = 0.70); on the Rey Osterich visual memory test after two months of transdermal E2 (P = 0.29) or on the Visual Span after four months of 1.25 mg CEE (P = 0.12). Also, performance on the facial recognition tests did not differ significantly between placebo and combined (0.625 mg + 1.25 mg) CEE treatment after 12 months (P = 0.40). The CASI long term memory test showed no evidence (P &gt; 0.30) of an effect with 1.25 mg CEE after two months. No difference was detected in SMD analyses using random- or fixed-effects models, and heterogeneity tests were also non-significant in these analyses.</P>

There was no evidence of a treatment or control effect on the Stroop Interference test (P = 0.90), the DSST (P = 0.70), or the Letter Cancellation test (P = 0.90). Only Finger Tapping was significantly faster after 12 months in controls (WMD = -3.90, 95% CI = -7.85 to 0.05, z = 1.93, P &lt; 0.05). Digit Span backward, as a measure of concentration and controlled information processing, was significantly better after four months of CEE (WMD = 0.67, 95% CI = -0.01 to 1.34, z = 1.94, P &lt; 0.05) but not after one month of CEE (P = 0.12) or after nine months of CEE + MPA (P = 1.00).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical impression of change, dementia severity and depression scales</HEADING>
<P>Both the CGIC and CIBIC showed no evidence of a treatment effect (P = 0.40). However, the CDR scores revealed that clinicians in general rated dementia severity to be less in participants taking placebo than in those on active treatment after 1.5 to 12 months (overall WMD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.69, z = 1.99, P &lt; 0.05). The Hamilton Depression rating scale did not show any evidence of a positive or negative effect of treatment (P = 1.00) after 3 or 12 months.</P>
<P>The heterogeneity test was not significant in any of the analyses, which could indicate that the results from studies were comparable and that the pooling of the data was valid. Using SMD with random-effects models when a significant effect was found also did not alter results.</P>
<P>In sum, the following effects were seen:<BR/>(i) There was a significant positive effect of a low dose of CEE up to two months when compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>). The higher dose of CEE and E2 did not show positive effects of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>)<BR/>(ii) After two months positive effects of low dose E2 on the delayed recall of the BSRT (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>) was shown (but the reverse was found after one month of CEE on the delayed paragraph recall, which was better for controls). However, there was a trend for this to reverse again at four months within the same study by <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>. No effects were found on immediate recall or on other word learning lists, visual memory tests or language tests.<BR/>(iii) After four months positive effects were seen after CEE (high dose) on Digit Span backward and the TMT-B test, but a reverse trend was seen in the same study (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>) after four months for the Digit Span forward test. No effects were seen on other complex speeded tests.<BR/>(iv) After four months also a positive effect was seen of high dose CEE on the HDS-R test (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) but this had not been significant between groups using the same test in another (not included) study (<LINK REF="STD-Honjo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Honjo 1995</LINK>) after a similar treatment duration with CEE and MPA.<BR/>(v) After 12 months, controls performed better than CEE on the Finger Tapping and the CDR, with a similar trend for the verbal Fluency test.</P>
<P>Using the inverse* Bonferroni rule for multiple comparisons of the separate analyses involving the same test used in different studies (including those which had been performed, but for which we had no data to include in the analyses), most HRT and ERT effects disappeared:<BR/>- The effects of CEE on the MMSE (P = 0.04 x 4) and TMT-B (P = 0.04 x 5) within one month of treatment, and on the Digit Span backward (P = 0.04 x 2) after four months of treatment did not remain.<BR/>- The effect of E2 transdermal treatment on the BSRT cued delayed recall after two months did remain (P = 0.0001 x 2) and that of the HDS-R after four months of CEE in participants with early onset dementia (P = 0.02 x1).<BR/>- The findings of controls having a better performance than ERT users also remained, even after inverse Bonferroni corrections (Paragraph Delayed Recall after 1 month, P = 0.009 x 3; Finger Tapping after 12 months, P = 0.05 and CDR after 12 months, P = 0.01 x 2).</P>

<P>This review found no overall positive effect of HRT or ERT in maintaining cognitive function in AD.

This effect was only significant after one to two months (but not after 3, 6, and 12 months) of a low dosage (0.625 mg) CEE treatment and disappeared after correction for multiple testing. In addition, this effect was small and clinically irrelevant (difference of 1 point on average). Others also reported not finding effects of two months transdermal estradiol (E2) treatment on the MMSE (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>) but as we had no data available, these results could not be included in the meta-analyses. Similarly, the positive time-limited effect of CEE on two tests which measured concentration and executive function (the TMT-B after one month CEE and Digit Span backward after four months CEE) disappeared after statistical correction for multiple testing. Only the effect of two months of a transdermal E2 treatment on cued delayed recall of a word list (BSRT <LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>) remained after correction. However, a combined score (derived from graphs in the article) showed no effect in another study using the same treatment for the same period of time, but with a higher dose. No effects of HRT or ERT were seen on the delayed paragraph recall or on immediate verbal recall in general (of a paragraph or of a word list), on visual memory, language or on most speeded tests. There were no positive effects on the clinical rating scales or on mood. In several instances, placebo gave better performance than treatment, for instance on the Paragraph Delayed Recall after one month of CEE (although there was a trend for this to reverse after four months) and on Finger Tapping after 12 months. While it could be suggested that cognitive tests may not reflect clinical change, dementia severity was also judged to be less severe in controls than in cases who had been treated with CEE for 12 months. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) reported an effect of a conjugated estrogen on a global test (HSD-R) after four months against vitamin B1 (thiamine). Another Cochrane review could not report positive effects in RCTs investigating the effects of thiamine on cognitive function in AD (<LINK REF="REF-Rodr_x00ed_guez_x002d_Mart_x00ed_n-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrguez-Martn 2001</LINK>), but it is not entirely clear how to interpret these results without a perhaps more appropriate placebo.</P>
<P>The following aspects need perhaps to be taken into account when reviewing the results of our meta-analyses.</P>
<P>- Size of studies and error introduced through recalculation of the SD of the mean difference<BR/>The initial study (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>) that maintained its significant effect of ERT was small (n = 12) and treatment with transdermal E2 was conducted for only a short period of time (two months). The later study (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 2001</LINK>) with a higher dose of the same treatment regimen (which also claimed similar effects) could not be replicated when data were extracted from graphs. A significant limitation of our analyses is that data needed to be extracted from graphs which may not have validly reflected the actual effect found (e.g. incorrect SE or introduction of error when extracting data using rulers). In addition, calculating the SD of the mean difference from extracted data was in our own analyses (using data of other treatment studies to compare actual and calculated SD of the mean difference) shown to sometimes overestimate the SD by a factor of two, especially in the smaller studies (n = 10-15). Most of the data used in the present review were judged by the original authors in peer-reviewed papers to show significant effects, which could, however, often not be replicated in our analyses of the individual studies. Instead many trends emerged which suggested a possible time-dependent effect, with positive effects seen after 1-2 months of treatments on some tests and negative effects seen after 12 months of estrogen treatment (see also <LINK REF="REF-Yesufu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yesufu 2007</LINK>)</P>
<P>- Type of cognitive test<BR/>Our earlier meta-analyses of the effects of estrogen treatment in healthy women (<LINK REF="REF-Yesufu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yesufu 2007</LINK>) found effects of E2 (intramuscular injections, but not of the transdermal E2 treatment) on verbal memory (in particular on one test, the Paired Associate learning test) and on some executive functions which had all been carried out by one research group. In the current review, the Paired Associate test had only been used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>). While effects seemed in favour of HRT, significance was not reached. As this was also a small study, it is difficult to assess whether the lack of effects could be attributed to the lack of power. Alternatively, these types of tests could be too complicated for AD cases. In this regard, cued recall, which is a much easier memory test, did show an effect of E2 treatment in the small AD study (<LINK REF="STD-Asthana-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Asthana 1999</LINK>) for a limited duration of time. Other more complex cognitive tests (executive function) were shown to be affected by ERT both in women with and those without dementia, but again only for a limited period of time (&lt; five months). It should be noted that several studies using similar tests in our analyses failed to replicate the significant short duration positive effects of ERT that had been reported by the authors.</P>
<P>- Type of treatment (estrogen, duration and dosage)<BR/>While at present it is unclear whether the type of estrogen could account for differences in the results found, we can conclude that CEE does not have positive effects in women with AD after a longer period of treatment (&gt; five months). This is in in line with the Chinese study (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) using a conjugated estrogen (developed by the same company who produces the CEE, Wyeth) which reported positive effects of ERT after four months when compared to vitamin B1.</P>
<P>It is unclear what the longer-term effects of E2 treatment would be. A single-blind study for 18 months in institutionalized women by <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-Caldwell-1952" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald Caldwell 1952</LINK> (in <LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>, which could not be included in this analyses) suggested that the effects of intramuscular injections of 2 mg of E2/week also (similar to CEE) declined after 12 months on several cognitive tests.</P>
<P>Another important question has been whether adding a progestagen could alter effects (<LINK REF="STD-Honjo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Honjo 1995</LINK>). This has often been assumed, as animal studies have shown that progestagens can counteract several of the actions of estrogens on monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems and possibly on the vascular system (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>). The one study (<LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>) of a longer duration, which added a progestagen to CEE, showed a slightly better performance on the Digit Span forward and the CIBIC compared with the studies that only used CEE (in a higher dosage).</P>
<P>Matters are complicated as the study which used the progestagen (<LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK>) also used a lower dosage of CEE than the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2000</LINK>). While in another study the low dosage of CEE was seen to have positive effects on the MMSE for a short period, after 12 months the 0.625 mg dosage of CEE actually tended to lead to worse performance than placebo, while the higher 1.25 mg regimen was associated with better intermediate performance (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>). It is at present thus unclear (but also unlikely) whether the dosage of CEE or the addition of a progestagen could alter treatment effects.</P>
<P>It has been suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Toran_x002d_Allerand-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toran-Allerand 2000</LINK> that continuous longer-term treatment with estrogens could result in a down-regulation of estrogen receptors in the brain. On some tests a positive effect was indeed seen for a limited duration of time. These positive effects usually disappeared after five months and in some cases even reversed. Adding a progestagen could potentially reverse down-regulation of receptors. However, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Birge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Birge 1997</LINK> did not seem to show a overall larger effect in comparison with the study by Mulnard where no progestagen was added.</P>
<P>- Participants (age at onset of AD and at testing, education, menopausal status and other potential confounds)<BR/>The largest and longest study had a wide age range (<LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK>: range 56 to 91). Age usually explains much of the variance in cognitive tests and could have over-ridden the small effects of treatment. The age range in the <LINK REF="STD-Mulnard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mulnard 2000</LINK> study also indicated that both participants with early- and late-onset AD had been enrolled. This was also probably the case for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>. Early- and late-onset AD are thought to differ in pathogenesis, and this could possibly have interacted with ERT or HRT. Whether HRT or ERT could have an effect in women with early-onset AD was investigated in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK> which intrigingly reported overall positive effects of treatment. This finding could support the 'window of opportunity' theory which states that hormones need to be given close to the natural age of menopause (around 50 years of age) to have a positive effect on the brain and which is substantiated by animal and human observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Education and depression were often not controlled for, and an earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>) suggested that women with low levels of education (who are additionally at risk for AD) may profit most from HRT or ERT. The MMSE in general had a wide range (10 to 28) indicating a wide variety of dementia severity in participants. Women with very mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment would be an important group to study as they may have more potential for benefit. Lastly, the current review did not include studies which selectively investigated women resident in nursing homes, and conclusions are therefore restricted to a largely community-dwelling population.</P>
<P>In sum, from our meta-analyses it has become clear that in the longer term (&gt; two months) that any (if at all) potential positive effects of estrogens on the brain seem to reverse. Overall data do not suggest that treatment with HRT or ERT for longer than a few months is recommended to maintain cognitive function in postmenopausal women with or without dementia.</P>
<P>The large prospective randomized placebo-controlled studies in the USA (Women's Health Initiative, WHI; PREPARE) (<LINK REF="REF-Schumaker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumaker 1998</LINK>) and the UK (Women's International Study of long Duration estrogen after Menopause, WISDOM) were abruptly stopped after the WHI found increased risks for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. In addition, a doubled risk for dementia was reported in women who had been randomized to Premarin (CEE) in combination with MPA treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 2003</LINK>) and a non significant effect for CEE alone was found in the same direction (<LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 2004</LINK>). This led to a substantial drop in HRT and ERT use, although data suggested that many women resumed taking (different) estrogens after a couple of months (<LINK REF="REF-Wegienka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wegienka 2006</LINK>). The majority of observational studies suggested that the risk for AD is decreased with the use of HRT or ERT (<LINK REF="REF-Yaffe-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaffe 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2000</LINK>). Since Premarin is the most widely prescribed drug, it was believed that it had protective effects against the development of AD. Part of that effect may be due to the 'healthy user bias' (see introduction), but this does not take into account the overwhelming evidence for estrogen's protective effect on the brain as is still reported in animal and cell-culture studies. Interestingly, also before WHI results were published, many women did not seem to use HRT for a long time (the majority &lt; one year) to treat menopausal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Wegienka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wegienka 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current evidence indicates that only short-term treatment with HRT is advisable; longer-term treatments should be avoided. Genotypes associated with sex steroid metabolism and AD should be investigated to see whether some women are more at risk for this than other women (<LINK REF="REF-Hogervorst-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogervorst 2007</LINK>). Intermittent treatments could be pursued as an alternative treatment option in conjunction with this (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Azzawi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Azzawi 2008</LINK>).</P>
