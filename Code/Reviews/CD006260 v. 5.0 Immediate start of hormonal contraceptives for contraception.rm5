<TITLE>Immediate start of hormonal birth control</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-15 16:29:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Health care providers often tell women to wait until their next menstrual cycle to begin birth control pills. The main reason is to avoid using birth control during an undetected pregnancy. Another method involves starting the pills right away ('immediate start' or 'quick start'). Another birth control method should be used as back-up for the first seven days. Unclear issues were whether quick start of hormonal birth control works as well as the usual start and whether women like it. The quick start method might improve women's use of hormonal birth control.</P>
<P>In August 2012, did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the quick-start method for pills and other hormonal birth control. We contacted researchers to find other studies. We included trials that compared quick start to the usual start of birth control. Also included were studies that compared quick start of different types of hormonal birth control with each other. Birth control methods could have the hormones estrogen and progestin (combined hormonal birth control) or just the progestin.</P>
<P>Five studies were included. In a study of 'depo,' which is given as a shot, fewer women with quick start of depo became pregnant than those who used another method for 21 days before depo. In this review, the numbers of women who stopped using their birth control method early were similar between groups in all trials. In the depo trial, more women with quick start of depo were very satisfied.</P>
<P>A trial of two quick-start methods showed women with the vaginal ring had less long-term bleeding and less frequent bleeding than those with pills. For six side effects, including changes in breasts, mood, and nausea, quick start of the ring showed fewer problems than quick start of pills. For satisfaction in that trial, more women in the ring group were very satisfied with their method of birth control.</P>
<P>We found little evidence that quick start leads to fewer pregnancies or fewer women stopping early. However, fewer women on quick start of depo became pregnant than the women who started with another method. Other differences were between types of birth control rather than start times. Women using the vaginal ring had fewer problems than women using birth control pills. More studies are needed comparing quick start versus usual start of the same hormonal birth control method.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-18 20:54:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Health care providers often tell women to wait until the next menses to begin hormonal contraception. The intent is to avoid contraceptive use during an undetected pregnancy. An alternative is to start hormonal contraception immediately with back-up birth control for the first seven days. Immediate initiation was introduced with combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and has expanded to other hormonal contraceptives. At the time of the initial review, how immediate start compared to conventional menses-dependent start was unclear regarding effectiveness, continuation, and acceptability. The immediate-start approach may improve women's access to, and continuation of, hormonal contraception.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-02 19:43:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Five studies were included. No new eligible studies have been found since the review was initially conducted. Method discontinuation was similar between groups in all trials. Bleeding patterns and side effects were similar in trials that compared immediate with conventional start. In a study of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), immediate start of DMPA showed fewer pregnancies than a 'bridge' method before DMPA (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.84). Further, more women in the immediate-DMPA group were very satisfied versus those with a 'bridge' method (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.77). A trial of two immediate-start methods showed the vaginal ring group had less prolonged bleeding (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89) and less frequent bleeding (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.03) than COC users. The ring group also reported fewer side effects. Also, more immediate ring users were very satisfied than immediate COC users (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.22).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-17 19:36:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We found limited evidence that immediate start of hormonal contraception reduces unintended pregnancies or increases method continuation. However, the pregnancy rate was lower with immediate start of DMPA versus another method. Some differences were associated with contraceptive type rather than initiation method, i.e., immediate ring versus immediate COC. More studies are needed of immediate versus conventional start of the same hormonal contraceptive.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-29 16:28:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-15 17:14:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The optimal time to start hormonal contraception remains unknown. Worldwide, nearly 104 million women use contraceptive pills and nearly 45 million use injectable contraceptives or implants (<LINK REF="REF-UNDP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNDP 2011</LINK>). Traditionally, women have been instructed to start combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in relation to their menstrual cycle: either on day one or within the first five to seven days of their menses (<LINK REF="REF-Kubba-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubba 1993</LINK>) or on the Sunday after their menses began (<LINK REF="REF-Williams_x002d_Deane-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams-Deane 1992</LINK>). Many health care providers and pharmaceutical companies suggest multiple options for starting oral contraceptives (OCs), which are timed in relation to menses (<LINK REF="REF-Williams_x002d_Deane-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams-Deane 1992</LINK>). These multiple options can create confusion regarding when to start the pill. Furthermore, menstruation requirements for initiation of contraception impede access to contraception for non-menstruating women, i.e., those who present for family planning services between two bleeding periods or during postpartum amenorrhea. Prospective studies in four developing countries showed service denial rates ranging from 5% to 47% among new family planning clients if they were not menstruating at the time of their visit (<LINK REF="REF-Stanback-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanback 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanback-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanback 2007</LINK>). Only 16% of providers in Kenya felt safe in giving women OCs to start taking later (<LINK REF="REF-Stanback-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanback 2003</LINK>). In Ghana and Senegal, less than 5% of providers reported they gave pills to non-menstruating women for later use at the onset of menses (<LINK REF="REF-Stanback-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanback 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommendation for women to wait until the next menses to begin hormonal contraception is intended to avoid contraceptive use during an undetected pregnancy. During this delay in contraceptive initiation, unintended pregnancies can occur, women may choose a less effective method or forget instruction (<LINK REF="REF-FSRH-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSRH 2010</LINK>), and fears of side effects increase (<LINK REF="REF-Westhoff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westhoff 2002</LINK>). This medically-imposed delay in starting contraception may increase the cost of family planning due to more repeat or return clinic visits. Worldwide, unintended pregnancies are associated with preventable morbidity and mortality. In contrast, reviews of epidemiological data and prospective studies have indicated that exogenous hormones during pregnancy did not increase risk of developing abnormalities in non-genital organs (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1981</LINK>); oral contraceptives were not associated with congenital malformations (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>An alternative is to start hormonal contraceptives immediately with back-up birth control for the first seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Lara_x002d_Torre-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lara-Torre 2004</LINK>). This 'immediate-start' or 'quick-start' method may improve initiation and continuation of hormonal contraceptives, among both adolescents and adults, compared to conventional start methods (<LINK REF="REF-Lara_x002d_Torre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lara-Torre 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westhoff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westhoff 2002</LINK>). Immediate start of birth control was introduced with combined oral contraceptives, which have both progestin and estrogen, and has been expanded to other hormonal contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>). When we conducted this initial review, how immediate start of hormonal contraception compared to conventional menses-dependent start was unclear regarding effectiveness, continuation, and acceptability. The practice of 'quick start' for hormonal contraceptives has since become accepted by professional organizations (<LINK REF="REF-FSRH-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSRH 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ARHP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARHP 2011</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-02 20:03:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Studies were examined for methodological quality, according to the principles recommended in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>. Factors considered were study design, randomization method, allocation concealment, blinding, and losses to follow-up and early discontinuation. Adequate methods for allocation concealment include a centralized telephone system and the use of sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002a</LINK>). Pharmacy distribution of pill bottles is another good method. Excluding randomized persons is not consistent with an intent-to-treat analysis and can bias the results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002b</LINK>). High losses to follow-up threaten validity (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>). Limitations in design are presented in <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> and were considered when interpreting the results.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-10-02 20:10:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated. Examples are the proportion of women who became pregnant or who discontinued contraception early. The Peto OR is useful when treatment effects are small and when events are not very common (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). This approach performs well under many circumstances, except when the study arm sizes are severely unbalanced, which rarely occurs in RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). A fixed-effect model does not require the assumption of normal distribution for the effects (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Fixed effect and random effects will give the same result if no heterogeneity exists, which is also the case if a comparison includes a single study. There is no consensus regarding the use of either model. We had planned to test for statistical heterogeneity. However, we did not combine data from any studies in meta-analysis due to differences in interventions.</P>
<P>For analysis, we used intent to treat or per protocol as data were available in the reports. Outcome data are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, along with any exceptions due to reporting.

Four trials were related, having been conducted by members of the same research group (<LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials included a total of 2427 women. Sample sizes ranged from 60 to 1720 with an average of 485. Sample sizes were 113 in <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK>, 60 in the pilot study of <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK>, 201 in <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>, 333 for <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK>, and 1720 in <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK>. All studies reported an a priori sample size determination: three focused on discontinuation rates (<LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK>) and two were based on bleeding and spotting days (<LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment duration was three cycles or 84 to 90 days in <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK> and six months in <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>The comparisons differed across trials. Immediate start refers to initiating contraception during the first visit. Conventional start of contraception included instruction to start during the next menses. Only <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK> excluded women who were currently menstruating. Two studies compared immediate versus conventional start of OCs; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK> used a COC (norethindrone 1 mg plus ethinyl estradiol (EE) 35 µg), while in <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK> the type of OC depended on the clinician's preference. <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK> examined immediate versus conventional start of the contraceptive patch (containing norelgestromin 6 mg plus EE 75 µg (<LINK REF="REF-Ortho_x002d_McNeil-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortho-McNeil 2007</LINK>)). <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK> examined immediate injection of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) versus a contraceptive 'bridge' to DMPA. 'Bridge' participants could choose pills, patch, or ring before DMPA and were given a 21-day supply; their first DMPA injection was administered 21 to 28 days later. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK> differed in that immediate use of the vaginal contraceptive ring (daily release: etonogestrel 120 µg plus EE 15 µg) was compared with immediate COC (norgestimate (NGM) 180/215/250 µg plus EE 30 µg).</P>
<P>In four trials, participants in both groups were instructed to use condoms as a backup (or abstain) for the first seven days or until they started their contraceptive method (<LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK>). Women in <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK> were also given emergency contraception. In <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK>, reportedly just the immediate-start group was instructed to use a back-up method like condoms for seven days; however, all participants were given a prescription for emergency contraception.</P>
<P>The outcomes included pregnancy data for all but <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK>, discontinuation of method for four trials, bleeding or cycle control data for all but <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK>, and satisfaction with method in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rickert 2007</LINK>). Data on side effects or adverse events were varied. For examples, <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 2005</LINK> only reported on nausea, and <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2007</LINK> reported just the serious adverse events. The Schafer 2006 report from the <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK> trial assessed the women for 10 potential side effects; participants could report no change, good change, or bad change.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-15 16:32:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>One of the purposes of immediate start of contraception is to improve initiation and continuation rates and thus decrease unintended pregnancies. In this review, pregnancy differed in one study that compared immediate start of DMPA to using a bridge to DMPA. Compared to many other contraceptive methods, DMPA is long-acting and less user-dependent. While the 'immediate-DMPA' group had proportionately fewer pregnancies, losses were high in that trial. Some of the studies were underpowered to detect differences in pregnancies. However, method discontinuation was similar between study groups in this review.</P>
<P>Cycle control, from bleeding diaries, only differed in a study of two immediate methods. The vaginal ring group had fewer bleeding problems than the COC group (<LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK>). The same trial solicited side effect information and showed differences between the vaginal ring and COC groups. <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2005</LINK> did not provide criteria or details for reporting side effects. Other trials showed the comparison groups to be similar for adverse events. The trials did not have consistent recording or reporting of side effects, which complicates interpretation. Furthermore, side effects may dissipate over time and these trials were relatively short-term.</P>
<P>For satisfaction, two trials showed some differences. In the DMPA trial, the group with immediate use of DMPA was more satisfied than those with a bridge method first. In the trial of two immediate methods, the vaginal ring group was more satisfied than the COC group. However, these studies were only three or six months in duration and satisfaction may vary over time.</P>
<P>All of the trials were relatively recent, yet they did not follow CONSORT guidelines for reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>). Design details were sometimes lacking. In addition, CONSORT recommends the reporting of outcome data in absolute numbers, rather than percentages. For outcomes reported as means, a measure of variation is needed to interpret the results. Two trials did not follow those guidelines, which prevented the inclusion of some data in the review.</P>
<P>This review was limited due to having only five trials and to great variation in the comparisons. One study compared two immediate-start methods. Of the four trials comparing immediate start with conventional start, one focused on the skin patch and another on DMPA (with or without a bridge method). The remaining two trials studied OCs, but one examined the same COC with different initiation methods, while the other left the OC choice to clinicians. In addition, no study was adequately powered for contraceptive effectiveness (pregnancy), a primary outcome for this review. Trials were generally powered to detect differences in continuation or bleeding patterns.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-15 16:53:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We found little evidence that immediate start of hormonal contraceptives reduces unintended pregnancies or increases continuation. Bleeding patterns and side effects were similar in trials that compared immediate start with conventional start. Immediate start is one of several acceptable options for starting COCs although more data are needed. One trial showed a lower risk of pregnancy with immediate start of DMPA versus bridging to DMPA with another method. High losses in that trial could have biased the results. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-15 16:53:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More trials are needed of immediate versus conventional start of the same (rather than a different) hormonal contraceptive method. The primary analysis should be done by intent-to-treat; that is, all enrolled participants should be included. Consistent recording and reporting of bleeding and other side effects would aid interpretation across trials. Improved follow-up is critical to interpretation of trial results, as high losses threaten validity. Sackett suggested that trials with greater than 20% loss to follow-up after randomization should not be considered valid (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>); Schulz suggested that the frequency of loss to follow-up should not exceed the frequency of the outcome event, e.g., pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, we endorse planning for adequate power (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2005</LINK>). However, if the scientific world insisted exclusively on large trials, many questions in medicine would languish unanswered. 'Underpowered' trials can be acceptable because they could be combined in a meta-analysis. Our suggestion has three caveats. First, the trial should be methodologically strong, thus eliminating bias. If designed and implemented properly, the trial would yield an unbiased estimate of effect even if it has low power (and precision). The results could then be combined with similar unbiased trials in a meta-analysis. Second, to avoid misinterpretation, authors should report their methods and results properly. If trial results were reported using interval estimation, the wide confidence intervals around the estimated treatment effect would depict the low power. Third, low-powered trials should be published regardless of their results so they can be used in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Finally, authors should adhere to the internationally accepted guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>).</P>
