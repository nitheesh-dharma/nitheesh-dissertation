<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Unwanted hair removal by laser systems and intense pulsed light sources</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Unwanted hair growth is a challenge and considerable resources are spent to achieve a hair-free appearance. Hair removal with laser devices (alexandrite, diode, neodymium:YAG, and ruby lasers) and intense pulsed light are widespread methods for hair removal although the long-term effect is uncertain. </P>
<P>Eleven randomised controlled trials were included in the review, none of which were of high quality. A large number of trials were excluded, mainly because of their non-randomised designs. There appeared to be a short-term effect of approximately 50% hair reduction with alexandrite and diode lasers up to six months after treatment, whereas there was little evidence for an effect with intense pulsed light, neodymium:YAG or ruby lasers. Long-term hair removal was not recorded for any treatment. Infrequently reported adverse effects were pain, skin redness, swelling, burned hairs and pigmentary changes. </P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Unwanted hair growth is a therapeutic challenge and considerable resources are spent to achieve a hair-free appearance. Epilation with laser devices (alexandrite, diode, neodymium:YAG, and ruby lasers) and intense pulsed light are commonly used although the long-term effect is uncertain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of epilation with lasers and light sources.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group's Specialised Register in February 2004; MEDLINE (from 1966) and EMBASE (from 1980) in April 2005. We searched reference lists of collected trials and contacted trial authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of laser or photoepilation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Primary outcomes were objective reduction in hair counts, adverse effects and subjective reduction in hairiness. Secondary outcomes were participants´ satisfaction and personal observations such as softer, finer, or paler hairs. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included eleven randomised controlled trials involving 444 people, none of which were of high methodological quality. A large number of trials were excluded, mainly because of their non-randomised design. The randomisation procedures were either unclear or inadequate, using coin tossing, alternation, drawing lots or cards, or open tables of random numbers. The interventions and outcomes were too heterogeneous to be entered in a meta-analysis. Most trials examined a short-term effect up to six months after final treatment. There appeared to be a short-term effect of approximately 50% hair reduction with alexandrite and diode lasers up to six months after treatment, whereas little evidence was obtained for an effect of intense pulsed light, neodymium:YAG or ruby lasers. Long-term hair removal was not documented with any treatment. Pain, skin redness, swelling, burned hairs and pigmentary changes were infrequently reported adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Some treatments lead to temporary short-term hair removal. High quality research is needed on the effect of laser and photoepilation.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Demands for efficient hair removal</HEADING>
<P>Millions of people all over the world remove unwanted hair at regular intervals and considerable amounts of time and money are spent in order to achieve a hair-free appearance. Traditional treatments include shaving, plucking, waxing, chemical depilatories, and electrolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1999</LINK>). None of these methods are ideal as their effects are short-term. Furthermore, the treatments may be tedious and adverse effects can occur which include pain, skin redness, swelling, blistering, crusting, infection, allergic eczema, decreased and increased skin pigmentation, as well as scarring (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e6_dersdal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hædersdal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liew-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nanni-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nanni 1999</LINK>). Increasing consumer demand for better hair removal has led to newer treatment techniques with laser devices and intense pulsed light (IPL). These are today considered the most efficient methods for removal of unwanted hair (<LINK REF="REF-Dierickx-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dierickx 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liew-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liew 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical presentation of unwanted hair growth</HEADING>
<P>Excess hair growth covers a broad range of severity and may present as hypertrichosis or hirsutism. Hypertrichosis is defined as excess hair at any body site, whereas hirsutism denotes excess hair growth in women at sites where only men normally develop coarse hair, primarily the face and neck around the beard area and sideburns as well as the escutcheon hair pattern in the pubic area. However, hair removal treatments are most often performed for cosmetic reasons in people with normal hair growth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Laser systems and intense pulsed light sources for hair removal</HEADING>
<P>Laser and photoepilation means hair removal by laser systems and Intense pulsed light (IPL) sources. Over recent years, several devices have been developed which are now offered as standard treatments for unwanted hair growth. The available lasers and light sources operate in the red or near-infrared wavelength regions: ruby lasers (694 nm), alexandrite lasers (755 nm), diode lasers (800, 810 nm), neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers (1064 nm), and IPL sources (590 to 1200 nm) (<LINK REF="REF-Alster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alster 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bjerring-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bjerring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-G_x00f6_rg_x00fc_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Görgü 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lou-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lou 2000</LINK>). The physical parameters used with these treatment systems vary considerably. However, all treatments using laser systems and IPL sources are based on the same concept, the theory of selective photothermolysis, which is an optimal interaction between light and skin whereby selected skin structures are targeted without damaging adjacent skin structures (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1983</LINK>). Selective photothermolysis is possible when melanin pigment in the hair follicles absorbs the wavelengths selected and the pulse duration is shorter than the time it takes for the heat to dissipate from the hair follicle into the surrounding tissue. The hair follicles are selectively destroyed by thermal damage and future hair growth is impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Altshuler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altshuler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grossman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grossman 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-22 16:01:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The large demand for removal of unwanted hair and the increasing use of laser and photoepilation calls for a critical appraisal of the benefits and harms of these newer techniques. Preliminary examination of the literature suggests a wide variation in the quality of studies evaluating laser and IPL and that the long-term effect is uncertain, which underlines the need for a systematic review of the most reliable studies.</P>

Measures of hairiness were dichotomised and we considered a reduction of at least 50% a worthwhile clinical change. In the protocol for our review, this outcome was considered a secondary one.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2008-06-22 16:04:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>(a) Participants´ satisfaction.<BR/>(b) Participants´ personal observations such as softer, finer, or paler hairs.</P>
<P>Hair counts, hairiness, and adverse effects were assessed from on-site clinical examinations or from photographs. Global improvement scales were sometimes used to evaluate hairiness, participants´ satisfaction and personal observations.</P>
<P>We considered hair reduction between one and six months after treatment as 'short-term' and beyond six months postoperatively (preferably more than 12 months) as 'long-term'. The distinction between short- and long-term hair reduction is based on the growth cycle of hair. In order to evaluate the true effect of any interventions, the trial period has to exceed the duration of the growth cycle in the treated area. The growth cycle can be divided into three phases, anagen (active growing phase), catagen (involutional stage), and telogen (resting phase) with the duration of phases and the distribution of hairs varying within different anatomical regions. Examples of growth phases are estimated as 1 to 2 months in thighs, 4 to 6 months in legs, 2 to 5 months on the upper lip, 12 months in the beard region, and 2 to 6 years in the scalp (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The following three areas were addressed:<BR/>(a) randomisation (method of generation and concealment of allocation);<BR/>(b) blinding of observers;<BR/>(c) exclusions after randomisation and losses to follow up.</P>
<P>Trials were considered high-quality if they had adequate allocation concealment, blinded observers, and applied an intention-to-treat analysis, or data were available from the publication which allowed for the intention to treat analysis to be performed. Trials were considered of poor quality if they had inadequate allocation concealment, unblinded observers, and exclusions were not accounted for after randomisation.</P>
<P>Concealment of allocation is the most important and sensitive indicator that bias has been minimised in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). We considered concealment adequate if there was: central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; other descriptions that contained elements of convincing concealment of allocation. We considered trials as non-randomised if randomisation was not mentioned in the abstract or the methods section. Unclear concealment meant that there was no description of the method, or that the description did not allow a clear distinction between adequate and inadequate concealment. Concealment was inadequate if there was: alternation; reference to case record numbers or date of birth; an open table of random numbers. If no information was given about blinding we assumed the trial was not blinded. The trial authors were contacted for clarification.</P>

<P>The data were much too heterogeneous and too poorly reported to be entered in a meta-analysis. Interventions and treatment protocols were very different, e.g. as concerns trial design, equipment, physical settings, number of treatments, and participants´ hair and skin characteristics. We therefore present the results from the individual trials in a narrative fashion. Data on adverse effects are similarly described qualitatively.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Long-term hair reduction</HEADING>
<P>Limited data were available on long-term hair reduction from one parallel-group trial with unclear randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2003</LINK>). The trial compared one treatment, using the alexandrite laser, with either two or three treatments given at monthly intervals. A total of 256 treatment sites in the axilla, arms and legs were used in 144 Asian participants with skin types III to V. At nine months after final treatment, hair reductions were 55% (three treatments), 44% (two treatments) and 32% (one treatment). These data were difficult to interpret as there were no measures of dispersion or statistical tests, dropouts were not accounted for, and some participants contributed with more than one test area, which mixes up within and between participant variations.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Short-term hair reduction</HEADING>
<P>A short-term effect of up to six months after treatment was evaluated in one parallel-group and seven within-participant trials with unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Nouri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nouri 2004</LINK>) or inadequate randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handrick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Handrick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nanni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nanni 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial evaluated the short-term effect of laser treatment versus sham treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2005</LINK>). This trial (n = 88) compared high-fluence alexandrite laser treatments (mean fluence 23.6 J/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, mean of 4.8 treatments) with low-dose sham treatments (fixed fluence 4.8 J/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, mean of 4.4 treatments) in hirsute women with polycystic ovary syndrome within a six-month study period and response evaluation one to two months after final treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2005</LINK>). The randomisation was not concealed. Significant improvements were seen in the intervention group versus the control group for self-reported severity of facial hair (reduction from 7.3 to 3.6 versus 7.1 to 6.1 on a scale 1 to 10), time spent on hair removal (reduction from 112 to 21 min. per week versus 92 to 56 min.), mean depression scores (reduction from 6.7 to 3.6 versus 6.1 to 5.4 on a scale 0 to 21), mean anxiety scores (reduction from 11.1 to 8.2 versus 9.6 to 9.3 on a scale 0 to 21), and psychological quality of life (improvement from 49.6 to 61.2 versus 50.1 to 51.5, scale not reported). Long-term hair removal was not evaluated.</P>
<P>Three trials compared lasers and light sources with each other (<LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handrick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Handrick 2001</LINK>). The first trial (n = 41) compared the effect of two long pulsed diode lasers with different pulse structures (<LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 2003</LINK>). Three treatments were given, to the upper lip, with each laser at six to eight week intervals. Only 29 participants completed the study. Six months after the final treatment, average hair reductions of 49% (810 nm "MedioStar") and 48% (800 nm "LightSheer") were found. The second trial (n = 11) compared a single treatment of IPL with a long pulse Nd:YAG laser in participants with darker skin types IV - VI (<LINK REF="STD-Goh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 2003</LINK>). Treatments were given to axilla, legs and faces with one half of the body randomly treated with Nd:YAG or IPL. Self-reported reductions in hairiness were no better than 20%, which was obtained in 7 and 8 of IPL and Nd:YAG laser treated participants, respectively. The third trial (n = 20) compared alexandrite with diode lasers (<LINK REF="STD-Handrick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Handrick 2001</LINK>). Clinical improvement scores were similar six months after three treatment sessions and hair counts were also similar (mean hair regrowth varied between 54% and 63%).</P>
<P>One trial (n = 17), using the alexandrite laser, compared different laser spot sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Nouri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nouri 2004</LINK>). Three treatments were given at six week intervals to axilla regions, and hair reductions of 52% (18 mm spot size) and 42% (12 mm spot size) were obtained six months after final treatment (no significant difference). The study had many drop-outs (6 of 17 participants) which were not accounted for. It also had an untreated control group but no data were given. Another trial (n = 69) evaluated the effect of two versus three monthly treatments with the ruby laser with data presented up to five months after final treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 2003</LINK>). However, the study was not adequately randomised, e.g. 7 left axillas versus 18 right axillas were treated three times and number of sides also varied substantially, although they should be identical since it was a within-participant trial; finally, data were missing for up to half of the participants.</P>
<P>Two trials evaluated the importance of varying pretreatment conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nanni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nanni 1997</LINK>). The first trial (n = 13) examined the effect of wax epilation before one treatment with the alexandrite laser (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2003</LINK>). The outcome used was a subjective overall impression of the reduction in hairiness one month after treatment. Blinded observers compared photos of laser treated squares with or without pre-waxing and decided which area looked better. In 12 of 13 participants, pretreatment with wax epilation resulted in more intense clearance of hair as compared with alexandrite laser treatment alone. The other trial (n = 12) evaluated the effect after one treatment with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with and without preoperative wax epilation and carbon solution (<LINK REF="STD-Nanni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nanni 1997</LINK>). Hair regrowth was delayed at one and three months in areas treated only with laser (mean regrowth 66% and 86%) whereas wax epilation resulted in mean regrowth of 78% and 102%. Preoperative waxing tended to improve the effect at one month (mean regrowth 47%) whereas similar regrowth was seen at three months (mean regrowth 85%). After six months, full regrowth was observed in all test areas, both objectively, and as evaluated subjectively by the participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects were evaluated in two trials as the only outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Eremia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Eremia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haedersdal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haedersdal 1999</LINK>) and in the other nine trials in addition to the beneficial outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handrick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Handrick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nanni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nanni 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nouri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nouri 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the studies of adverse effects evaluated pain from alexandrite and diode lasers, but the number of participants in the analyses, the number of drop-outs, and the score system for assessing pain were all unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Eremia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Eremia 2000</LINK>). In the other study, pigmentary alterations and texture changes were evaluated 12 weeks after one treatment with the ruby laser at three fluence levels versus an untreated control area (n=17) (<LINK REF="STD-Haedersdal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haedersdal 1999</LINK>). Hypopigmentation was the most frequently observed adverse effect, occurring in 5 of 51 laser treated areas and in 1 of 17 untreated control areas. Hyperpigmentation occurred in 1 of 51 laser treated areas and none of 17 untreated control areas. No texture changes were observed in any test areas.</P>
<P>Two participants out of 69 had superficial burns and depigmentation, and one reactivation of herpes on the ruby laser (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 2003</LINK>). More women felt pain or discomfort when treated with the alexandrine laser than with sham laser (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 2005</LINK>). No scarring or pigmentary changes occurred, but more intense skin redness (erythema) (P &lt; 0.001) and burned hairs (P &lt; 0.001) were noted with the 800 nm diode laser than with the 810 nm diode laser (<LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 2003</LINK>). Seven of 11 participants felt pain after Nd:YAG laser and after IPL (<LINK REF="STD-Goh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 2003</LINK>), described as "a pinprick sensation" and "a prolonged burning sensation", respectively, three participants developed blisters and five participants developed postinflammatory pigmentation after IPL treatment whereas none of these adverse effects were seen after Nd:YAG laser treatment. Three of twelve participants developed transient folliculitis after treatment with a Nd:YAG laser (<LINK REF="STD-Nanni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nanni 1997</LINK>). More pain was noted with the diode laser than with the alexandrite laser and two participants developed transient hyperpigmentation with the diode laser (<LINK REF="STD-Handrick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Handrick 2001</LINK>). No adverse effects were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nouri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nouri 2004</LINK>). In the remaining trials, adverse effects were not divided by treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2003</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-22 16:29:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Treatment techniques in laser and photoepilation cover a broad range of laser and IPL devices from different manufacturers, including several wavelengths, pulse durations and pulse configurations, different spot sizes, skin cooling, and fluence levels. Moreover, a variety of treatment protocols has been used with different numbers of treatments and varying intervals between treatments. There is also great variation in trial participants related to skin and hair characteristics such as skin pigmentation, hair colour, hair thickness, hair growth cycle, anatomical region and depth of follicles, as well as endocrine dysfunction, which may influence the treatment outcome. All of these variables contribute to the confusion among practitioners and the general public regarding the true efficacy and limitations of laser and IPL-assisted hair removal. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the majority of the trials had short follow-up periods. Furthermore, all trials included in this review were of low methodological quality, although it could be argued that concealment of allocation might be less important for within-participant trials where the investigators have little incentive for choosing one side of the body or another for their preferred treatment. Due to the fact that none of the available trials were of high methodological quality, it could be argued that the true efficacy from laser- and photoepilation may not be answered until high quality trials are published. </P>
<P>A large number of non-randomised controlled studies on the efficacy of laser and IPL hair removal have been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e6_dersdal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hædersdal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 2002</LINK>). Some of these studies were designed as within-participant trials with left-right comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Bjerring-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bjerring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-G_x00f6_rg_x00fc_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Görgü 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1999</LINK>), which may, on average, be less biased than non-randomised parallel-group studies. Some of the non-randomised studies had long-term follow-up times (<LINK REF="STD-Baumler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baumler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eremia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eremia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lou-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lou 2000</LINK>). One of these studies compared one to four treatments with the long pulsed Nd:YAG laser with an untreated control. One year after the final treatment, more than 50% hair reduction was still present in 40% of areas treated five times versus none of the untreated control areas or areas treated once (<LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 2002</LINK>). In another study, the effect of a diode laser (n = 50) was significantly better than that of shaving, and two repetitive treatments (34% to 53% hair reduction) were superior to a single treatment (28% to 33% hair reduction) at an average follow-up of 20 months after final treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Lou-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lou 2000</LINK>). Another study found similar effects of repetitive treatments (three to four treatments) with the alexandrite laser (n = 15) and the diode laser (hair reductions of 85% and 84%, respectively) at the 12 month follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Eremia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eremia 2001</LINK>). Moreover, a study compared alexandrite laser with electrolysis (<LINK REF="STD-G_x00f6_rg_x00fc_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Görgü 2000</LINK>). Three treatments with the alexandrite laser (mean 74% reduction) were more efficient than four treatments of electrolysis (mean 35% reduction) six months postoperatively and all 12 participants preferred laser treatment to electrolysis due to better effect and less pain (<LINK REF="STD-G_x00f6_rg_x00fc_-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Görgü 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is important that people seeking removal of unwanted hair and laser practitioners have realistic expectations of the treatment outcome from laser and photoepilation. Several manufacturers have received the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) permission to claim 'permanent hair reduction' (www.fda.gov/cdrh/consumer/laserfacts.html). Permanent hair reduction is in this context defined as a long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs re-growing after a treatment regimen, which may include several sessions. The number of regrowing hairs must be stable over a time greater than the duration of the complete growth cycle of hair follicles, which varies from 4 to 12 months according to the body location. Permanent hair reduction does in the FDA context not necessarily imply the elimination of all hairs in the treatment area. It is confusing for consumers that 'permanent hair reduction' does not really mean permanent hair reduction. As might be expected, the message has often been distorted in newspapers and advertisements that promise "permanent hair removal". This misrepresentation of the facts may lead people to have unrealistic expectations as they are normally not aware of FDA definitions of 'permanency'. From the affected person's point of view 'permanency' means that removed hair does not re-grow at all. Using this more readily understandable concept of permanency, no clinical trials to date have demonstrated permanent hair removal after laser or photoepilation. Those studies that have been performed indicate that such an effect is very unlikely since hair regrowth occurred in all studies that included this outcome measure. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite the enormous amount of resources involved in hair removal with lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL), there are no randomised trials that have shown a long-term effect of these interventions. There appeared to be a short-term effect of approximately 50% hair reduction with alexandrite and diode lasers up to six months after treatment, whereas little evidence was obtained for an effect of intense pulsed light, neodymium:YAG or ruby lasers. Long-term hair removal was not obtained with any treatment. Pain, skin redness, swelling, burned hairs and pigmentary changes were infrequently reported adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for high-quality trials of laser and photoepilation. Particularly needed are trials with long-term evaluations, trials evaluating the efficacy of lasers and IPL versus untreated control groups and trials comparing the efficacy of laser and IPL treatments. The importance of individual participant characteristics remains to be answered and trials are also required in specific populations such as hirsute women with and without endocrine dysfunction. Such trials could provide a more rational approach to the treatment strategy of unwanted hair growth and, hopefully, optimise the cost-benefits associated with the treatments and result in realistic expectations from affected people.</P>
