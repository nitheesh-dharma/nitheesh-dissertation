<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-12-18 16:43:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness which mostly affects people in early adulthood. The symptoms of schizophrenia are perceptions without cause (hallucinations), fixed false beliefs (delusions) and/or apathy, slowing and less movement or thought. People with this condition are usually treated with antipsychotic medication but there are a significant number of people receiving this treatment who don&#8217;t respond, or develop uncomfortable adverse effects. Aripiprazole is a new medication which acts differently in the brain to other antipsychotics and may benefit people who have been resistant to treatment so far. This review compares aripiprazole to the older &#8216;typical&#8217; antipsychotics.</P>
<P>The data for nine clinical trials containing a total of 3622 patients were analysed. In the trials of less than 12 weeks that reported improvement of general well-being and mental state, there was no statistically significant difference between typical antipsychotics and aripiprazole. However, when looking at adverse effects, people on aripiprazole were less likely to suffer from movement side effects, blurred vision, high levels of the hormone prolactin or increased heart rate. These people were also less likely to withdraw their consent to being in the study in short (less than 12 weeks) and longer (more than 12 weeks) trials. Conversely, people on typical antipsychotics were significantly less likely to feel dizzy or nauseous. These trials were all quite different from each other - they had varying settings, enrolled different groups of people, were for varying lengths of times (from 24 hours to 52 weeks) and compared aripiprazole to different first generation antipsychotics. This made it difficult to compare outcomes from trial to trial. In addition, a lot of the data were not able to be used because measurements were not given in full. This medication looks promising but there needs to be more trials, particularly longer-term well-planned trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:56:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> We included nine randomised trials involving 3122 people comparing aripiprazole with typical antipsychotic drugs. None of the studies reported on relapse - our primary outcome of interest. Attrition from studies was high and data reporting poor. Participants given aripiprazole were comparable to those receiving typical drugs in improving global state and mental state. Aripiprazole provided a significant advantage over typical antipsychotics in terms of fewer occurrences of extra-pyramidal symptom (n=968, 3 RCT, RR 0.46 CI 0.3 to 0.9, NNT 13 CI 17 to 10), and particularly akathisia (n=897, 3 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 11 CI 14 to 9). Fewer participants given aripiprazole developed hyperprolactinaemia (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.07 CI 0.03 to 0.2, NNT 2 CI 3 to 1). Aripiprazole presented a lesser risk of sinus tachycardia (n=289, 1 RCT, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.8, NNT 22 CI 63 to 13) and blurred vision (n=308, 1 RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.1 to 0.7, NNT 14 CI 25 to 10); but enhanced risk of occurrence of dizziness (n=957, 3 RCT, RR 1.88 CI 1.1 to 3.2, NNH 20 CI 33 to 14) and nausea (n=957, 3 RCT, RR 3.03 CI 1.5 to 6.1, NNH 17 CI 25 to 13). Attrition rates were high in both groups, although significantly more participants in the aripiprazole group completed the study in the long term (n=1294, 1 RCT, RR 0.81 CI 0.8 to 0.9 NNT 8 CI 5 to 14). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:56:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> Aripiprazole differs little from typical antipsychotic drugs with respect to efficacy, however it presents significant advantages in terms of tolerability. Clearly reported pragmatic short, medium and long term randomised controlled trials are required to replicate and validate these findings and determine the position of aripiprazole in everyday clinical practice. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-21 12:40:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>'Conventional' antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have traditionally been used as a first line treatment for people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1993</LINK>). However, approximately 5-25% of people with schizophrenia show poor response to these treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Christison-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christison 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1992</LINK>). In addition, adverse effects such as movement disorders and sedation often make compliance with these medications problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>). Although their efficacy in alleviating positive schizophrenic symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) is reasonably clear, their effect on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (such as apathy and poverty of speech) is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Crow-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crow 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>'Atypical' or 'second generation' antipsychotics include drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpride and ziprasidone. Initially, these were said to differ from typical antipsychotics in that they were found not to cause movement disorders (catalepsy) in rats at clinically effective doses. Other more clinically-important distinguishing factors include their reputed effects on both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (although this is far from certain), their more limited adverse effect profiles, particularly in relation to movement disorders, and the possibility that these drugs may improve cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Gelder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelder 2001</LINK>). These atypical drugs however are far from ideal, and problematic adverse effects do occur. With the exception of ziprasidone, most atypicals are associated with marked weight gain and disruption of glucose metabolism that may lead to diabetes. Clozapine, which is used for people whose illness is 'treatment-resistant', may induce life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis) as well as heart problems (acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy) and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aripiprazole is a relatively new antipsychotic which is currently being marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd and Bristol Myers Squibb. It is said to be the prototype of a new third generation of antipsychotics; the so-called dopamine-serotonin system stabilisers. Aripiprazole is claimed to be at least as effective as haloperidol for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as fixed, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptions without cause (hallucinations). It is also claimed to be effective against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy and slowing and paucity of movement and thought. It has also been suggested that aripiprazole may be associated with fewer movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonias, tardive dyskinesia), less weight gain and reduced negative effects on the heart (QTc interval abnormalities) and on glucose metabolism compared with standard antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). In addition, aripiprazole is said to be useful in both the acute and maintenance phases of schizophrenia, and to have cognition enhancing effects.</P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Aripiprazole is reported to exert its antipsychotic effects by acting as a partial agonist at D2 dopamine and 5-HT1a serotonin receptors, and as an antagonist at 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. It has been postulated that, through the above receptor site actions, and hence dopamine and serotonin system stabilisation, a partial D2 agonist would be able to act as an antagonist in pathways where an abundance of dopamine was producing psychosis, yet it would stimulate receptors as an agonist at sites in which low dopaminergic tone would produce side effects (e.g. areas mediating motor movement and prolactin release) (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). Aripiprazole, however, also has an affinity for other receptors including D3, D4, 5-HT2c, 5-HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and H1 histamine receptors. This may explain adverse effects associated with this compound such as somnolence, headache, gastrointestinal upset and light-headedness (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended target dose for aripiprazole is 10-15 mg/day (dose range 10-30 mg). Phase III trials were initially conducted in Japan in 1995, and the drug was granted Approvable Status by the FDA (USA) on the 15th November 2002, for the treatment of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2002a</LINK>). Aripiprazole has since been licensed in most countries worldwide, including in the UK for treatment of schizophrenia.</P>
<P>In an earlier Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>), the reviewers concluded that aripiprazole is as effective as typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia, although data are far too few to allow any conclusions to be drawn. Aripiprazole does not offer significant advantages over these two classes of drugs in terms of outcomes with the exception of causing less hyperprolactinaemia and rises in QTc interval than risperidone. Aripiprazole may be the first of a new generation of atypical drugs but its clinical effects do not seem to be very different from those of older drugs. More studies are needed to replicate and validate these findings. The current review is envisaged as one of a triad of three separate reviews comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs respectively, on the contextual background of the original singular review.</P>

<P>[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to the Glossary].</P>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>Citation information downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution or journal of publication. We independently inspected all reports. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and where doubt remained, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we independently decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information and these trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), which is based on the degree of allocation concealment. Poor concealment has been associated with overestimation of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Category A includes studies in which allocation has been randomised and concealment is explicit. Category B studies are those which have randomised allocation but in which concealment is not explicit. Category C studies are those in which allocation has neither been randomised nor concealed. Only trials that are stated to be randomised (categories A or B of the handbook) were included in this review. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:</P>
<P>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the handbook criteria. However, the Jadad Scale was not used to exclude trials.</P>
<P>3. Data collection<BR/>JB independently extracted data from selected trials, and HGE re-extracted data from two different samples (10%). Where disputes arose we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data but added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>We assessed outcomes using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as "little change", "moderate change" or "much change") or dichotomous (for example, either "no important changes or "important change" in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so we were unable to analyse this.</P>
<P>4.2 Incomplete data<BR/>We did not include trial outcomes where more than 40% of people were not reported in the final analysis.</P>
<P>4.3 Dichotomous - yes/no - data<BR/>We analysed data using an intention to treat analysis. If more than 60% of people completed the study, everyone allocated to the intervention was counted whether they complete the follow up or not. We assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death.</P>
<P>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to binary data. This was done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into "clinically improved" or "not clinically improved". It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). It was recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illness, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (e.g. 25% on the BPRS) would be equally valid. If individual patient data were available, the 50% cut-off was used for the definition in the case of non-chronically ill people and 25% for those with chronic illness. If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
<P>We calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) as the inverse of the risk difference.</P>
<P>4.4 Continuous data<BR/>4.4.1 Normally distributed data:<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); in cases with data that are greater than the mean they were entered into 'Other data' table as skewed data and noted in the text of the review. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we entered change data in RevMan analyses and reported the finding in the text to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
<P>4.4.2 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, only final endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We are contacting authors of studies reporting only change data for endpoint figures.</P>
<P>4.4.3 Rating scales<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, and are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, we stipulate that the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it is expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, such data was included but commented on as 'prone to bias'.</P>
<P>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that use the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, both sets of data were presented and the general direction of effect inspected.</P>
<P>4.4.4 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>4.5 Crossover design<BR/>We expected that some trials would use a crossover design. In order to exclude the potential additive effect in the second or later stages on these trials, only data from the first stage were analysed.</P>
<P>4.6 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge for clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We supplemented this by using primarily the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 50%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of considerable levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Where heterogeneity was present, reasons for this were investigated. If it substantially altered the results, we did not summate data, but presented the data separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>Results for high doses (however 'high' were defined in the study or, if such a definition was not presented, greater than 15 mg aripiprazole per day) were compared to those for lower doses with regard to the primary outcome of relapse.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for aripiprazole.</P>

<P>For substantive descriptions of the studies please see Included and Excluded Studies tables.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded sixteen studies from the review. Three were review articles (<LINK REF="STD-Argo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Argo 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petrie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Petrie 1997</LINK>). Two studies were quasi-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2005</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kelemen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kelemen 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 2006</LINK>) reported data of comparisons between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs with no data available for the individual drugs. We will try to obtain further data about groups allocated to individual drugs (i.e. aripiprazole). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2002</LINK> because, although randomised, it evaluated one switch regimen to aripiprazole versus another and also reported no data that could be included. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2004</LINK> is a naturalistic study which evaluated the effectiveness of switching to aripiprazole with prior stratified exposure to various antipsychotics with no identified comparator drug. <LINK REF="STD-Shim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shim 2006</LINK> evaluates the effect of adjunctive treatment with aripiprazole versus placebo for haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinaemia. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Xia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xia 2005</LINK> due to discrepant data reporting which rendered the reported data unusable. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Andrezina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Andrezina 2006</LINK> because it reports a sub-population post-hoc analysis of a previously reported RCT which has been included in this review. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Talbott-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Talbott 2007</LINK>) conducted post-hoc analyses of pooled data from three randomised controlled trials. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Jung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2007</LINK> because treatment with haloperidol and adjunctive aripiprazole was compared with haloperidol with adjunctive placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK> evaluates the switch from existing antipsychotics to aripiprazole and other antipsychotics, and aripiprazole is not compared with any specific antipsychotic drug.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Currier-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Currier 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2007</LINK> report minimal data which could not be used. We have contacted Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company for more data. We are waiting for <LINK REF="STD-Ao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ao 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhuang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhuang 2006</LINK> which are published in Chinese to be translated so we can assess these for future updates of this review.</P>
<P>3.Ongoing studies<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Barbui-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barbui 2006</LINK> is presently recruiting people with schizophrenia in a trial comparing aripiprazole, clozapine and haloperidol.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We identified nine studies that for inclusion. All were described as randomised and all (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>) but two as being double-blind. <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> was an open-label study, though the rating scale outcome assessor was blind to the allocation of the intervention. The blinding status was not described for <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Schizophrenia is an illness that affects young people and is lifelong. Eight studies reported data on short-term follow-up (up to 12 weeks) of which two studies involved the administration of intramuscular aripiprazole and had extremely short follow-up periods of up to 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>). One study reported data on long-term follow-up (over 26 weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.2 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK> with 1294 people was the largest study. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> randomised 72 participants. All the remaining studies included between 100 and 500 participants.<BR/>
<BR/>4.3 Participants<BR/>All included studies involved participants with clearly operationalised diagnoses. Five trials included people with a sole diagnosis of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>). The remaining four studies included patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>). Males comprised a significant majority of the participants. Six studies excluded participants with a prior history of refractoriness to anti-psychotic medication (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> excluded participants with a clear history of response or lack of response to a particular antipsychotic drug and who, in the judgement of the treating psychiatrist, would best be treated accordingly. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> required participants to be resistant to at least two periods of treatment (each lasting at least six weeks) with adequate doses of antipsychotic agents (one of which had to be a typical antipsychotic) during the two years prior to the study, but excluded people with previous unsatisfactory response to perphenazine or clozapine. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> included people who were acutely ill.</P>
<P>4.4 Setting<BR/>Six of the nine studies were described as occurring in hospital or inpatient settings (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK> took place in out-patient or mixed settings. We could find no explicit information on the settings of the remaining studies. All trials involved adult participants <U>&gt;</U> 18 years of age. All studies included participants of both genders. Only <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> does not describe the sex distribution of the participants. All included studies involved adult participants, &#8805;18 years of age.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>4.5.1 Experimental drugs<BR/>The trialists used aripiprazole in a wide range of doses from 1 mg per day to 30 mg per day. In most studies drugs were given orally, apart from two studies where medication was given intramuscularly (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.5.2 Comparison drugs<BR/>Comparators were placebo, conventional antipsychotics {haloperidol (5-20 mg/day), perphenazine (8-64 mg/day) and chlorpromazine (50-500 mg/day)} and the newer generation antipsychotics {olanzapine (5-40 mg/day); risperidone (2-9 mg/day); quetiapine (50-1200 mg/day); ziprasidone (40-240 mg/day)}. We have only used outcome data from the typical drugs arm in the analysis.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>Our primary outcome of relapse was not clearly reported in any study. All other outcomes in this review were of secondary importance to us but we do recognise that they may be of primary interest to others.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> reported usable data on death.</P>
<P>We have used mean change in CGI-S score and mean CGI-I score as global state outcome measures. Only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data in this respect. <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> reported mean change data from the CGI-S score and CGI-I score from baseline, but we were unable to derive a summated change data for all the participants randomised to the different dose groups of aripiprazole. Consequently we have excluded these data from the analysis. We have used discontinuation from the study due to an adverse event including psychosis, non-compliance with study protocol, lack of efficacy and marked deterioration as global state outcomes.</P>
<P>We have used clinically significant response to treatment with antipsychotic medication and BPRS total score and PANSS score as mental state outcome measures. Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>) reported usable data about clinically significant response to treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> defined response to treatment as a CGI-I score of 1 or 2, or a &#8805;30% decrease from baseline in PANSS total score. <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> defined clinical response as a reduction &#8805; 40% in PEC score from baseline to 2 hours after first injection. <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> defined clinically significant response as a sufficient improvement in the patient's mental state within the study period to no longer necessitate acute in-patient care. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> defined &gt;80% decrease in PANSS score as cure, &gt;50% decrease as markedly improved, &gt;25% decrease as improved and &lt;25% decrease as showing no effect. We chose the 50% cut-off as indicative of clinically significant response. The validity of this dichotomising from these measures as used in the respective studies was nevertheless not investigated. The other studies did not report any usable data in this respect. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> reported usable data about changes in BPRS total scores; and only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data about changes in PANSS total scores. <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> reported data about change in mean BPRS score from baseline, but we were unable to use the data for analysis due to our inability to derive a summated change result from the groups of participants randomised to different doses of aripiprazole.<BR/>
<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> reported data about behaviour in terms of change in ACES score and CABS score. However we have been unable to use the data in our analysis due to our inability to derive a summated effect from the groups of participants randomised to different doses of aripiprazole.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>) reported usable data on specific adverse effects and extrapyramidal side-effects, but only those spontaneously reported in more than 5% of participants. This design precludes reporting of important less frequent effects. Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported usable data on clinically significant weight gain which was defined as &gt; 7% increase from baseline. It was unclear however how the level of significant weight gain (7 percent) was decided upon. We found no mention of this figure in the methodology section of the included study reports and if it was decided on after the data were inspected, any results would be prone to bias.<BR/>

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data about quality of life. The Quality of Life Scale data was dichotomised and a clinically significant improvement in this scale was defined as being at least a 20% improvement from baseline.</P>

<P>All but <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> reported usable data on leaving the study early due to any reason.</P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales: only details of the scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' table.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Global state<BR/>4.6.1.1.1 Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement. A CGI-I (CGI-Improvement) score was also validated for use in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Mental state<BR/>4.6.1.2.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.2 PANSS excited component score - PEC score (<LINK REF="REF-Lindenmeyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindenmeyer 2004</LINK>)<BR/>This scale consists of five items on the PANSS total scale (hostility, lack of cooperation, excitement, poor impulse control, and tension), with each item scored on a scale of 1(absent)to 7(extreme). It is a validated instrument that allows assessment of the antiagitation effects of antipsychotic treatment and is particularly useful in acute treatment settings. It is a physician-rated observation that avoids the need for interaction between the patient and physician that could exacerbate agitation. <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.3 Brief psychiatric rating scale - BPRS (Overall &amp; Gorham1962)<BR/>This is a semi structured interview schedule composed of 18 symptom constructs measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18 item scale is commonly used and some versions may include up to 25 items. The items are rated on a 7-point scale and include self-report and interviewer-rated observations. Scores can range from 0-126. Although its psychometric properties in terms of reliability, validity and sensitivity have been extensively examined (<LINK REF="REF-Hedlund-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedlund 1980</LINK>), the clinical implications of BPRS scores are not always clear. <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Quality of life<BR/>4.6.1.3.1 Quality of Life Scale -QLS (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This is a semi structured interview administered and rated by trained clinicians. It contains 21 items rated on a 7-point scale based on the interviewer&#8217;s judgement of patient functioning. A total QLS and four sub-scale scores are calculated, with higher scores indicating less impairment. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.7 Missing outcomes<BR/>Our primary outcome of relapse was not clearly reported in any study. No usable outcomes were found for the following categories: service outcomes, general functioning, engagement with services and cognitive functioning.</P>
<P>4.8 Redundant data<BR/>In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>) the trialists compare aripiprazole with both haloperidol and placebo, with the data related to the latter being rendered redundant. <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> compares aripiprazole with haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone with the data related to the atypical drugs being redundant for the purposes of this review. The trialists have reported continuous measures of global state (CGI), repeated measures of mental state (BPRS, BPRS-PANNS), and adverse effects (Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes Akathisia scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement scale) and other outcome measures including changes in body weight, serum prolactin, and QTc interval changes but no variances have been reported. We were unable to include these data in our analyses. This poor reporting is by no means unique to any particular study (see Included Studies table, Outcomes). Other problems have included the use of non-externally validated outcome scales such as the TESS (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>). We have asked various representatives of Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals (UK) for further clarification on numerous data that were not adequately reported thereby rendering them as unsuitable for inclusion in the analysis. At the time of publishing this update, we have not received any additional data from Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals. Enormous efforts were invested in studies rating and recording data that are then reported in such a way as to render them useless for reviews such as this. Participants in trials may be appalled to know how much of their data has been rendered useless.</P>

<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All included studies were said to be randomised. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>) details a centralised call-in system organised by the study centres using permuted block randomisation where those in charge of allocation were blind to the participant list. None of the other included studies explicitly detailed the method of randomisation. This concealment of allocation has repeatedly been shown to be of key importance in excluding selection biases (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jni 2001</LINK>). Therefore all trials were category B (moderate risk of bias - some doubt about the results - see Methods), apart from <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> which qualified for category A. This was confirmed by correspondingly poor ratings on the Jadad Scale (see Included Studies table).</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>Seven studies were described as being double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> the randomised double-blind treatment phase with aripiprazole was preceded by a 4-6 week open label atypical antipsychotic treatment phase to confirm treatment-resistance, and then by a 2-10 day single-blind placebo-washout phase. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>) was described as open-label, but the assessor of the outcome rating scales was blind to the intervention allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> did not describe blinding. None of the studies reported testing of the blinding. If blinding is recognised to be of such importance for minimising observation bias, it could be expected that testing of this blinding would be a priority.</P>
<P>3. Loss to follow up<BR/>Some of the included studies reported data in terms of a last observation carried forwards (LOCF) analysis and an OC analysis (observed cases, defined as those completing the trial). Although LOCF analyses are commonly used to account for missing observations, this technique could introduce bias as considerable assumptions are made about people who did not stay in the study. We saw no reporting of attempts to validate assumptions by following up people who did drop out early. In <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK> dropout rates were more than 40%. Using LOCF, more than 40% of the data on certain outcomes are assumed and we feel that this amount of fabricated data is too great. We have only included data from these studies about leaving the study early; discontinuation due to adverse events, non-compliance with study protocol, lack of efficacy and marked deterioration; and death in the analyses. For studies with &#8805;60% total completion rates we have tried to undertake an intention-to-treat analysis. Where no data were available for proportions of 60%, we have assumed a negative outcome other than death (see Methods).</P>
<P>The reasons for loss to follow up are reasonably well reported and we have recorded these in the outcomes.</P>
<P>4. Data reporting<BR/>Overall much of the data we found could not be used because of poor reporting. Findings which are presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as p-values are often of little use to a reviewer. Many studies failed to provide standard deviations when reporting mean changes on a particular outcome measure. We are seeking further data from the first authors of relevant trials.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:02:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. The Search<BR/>The initial search in (May 2007) identified 211 citations from 135 studies. Of these we were only able to include nine studies in the review. The update search (Nov 2007) identified 103 citations. We did not find any additional studies that we could include from the update search. Many studies are multiply reported in different media. We have contacted various professionals from Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals (UK) for further studies and data. At the time of publishing this review, we have not received any further information.<BR/>
<BR/>2. COMPARISON 1: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus TYPICAL antipsychotic drugs (short term &lt; / = 12 weeks).<BR/>2.1 Death<BR/>No deaths were reported in the studies in either comparator group (n=955, 3 RCT, RR not estimable).</P>
<P>2.2 Global state - dichotomous outcomes<BR/>We prestated relapse as being our primary outcome of interest. None of the included studies reported usable data for relapse.</P>
<P>2.3 Global state - continuous outcomes<BR/>2.3.1 Improvement in CGI-S scale score<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>) provided usable data for improvement in CGI-S scale score. Aripiprazole did not show any statistically significant greater improvement in CGI-S scale scores compared to perphenazine (n=300, 1 RCT, WMD 0.00 CI -0.3 to 0.3).</P>
<P>2.3.2 CGI-I score<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> provided usable data for CGI-I scale scores. Aripiprazole did not improve CGI-I scale scores to a statistically significant degree compared with perphenazine (n=300, 1 RCT, WMD -0.20 CI -0.5 to 0.1).</P>
<P>2.4 Mental state - dichotomous outcomes<BR/>2.4.1 Clinically significant response to treatment<BR/>A total of 56% of participants given aripiprazole and 54% of participants given typical antipsychotics failed to achieve a clinically significant response to treatment, and the results were significantly heterogeneous (n=1447, 6 RCT, RR 1.01 CI 0.8 to 1.3, I2 70.7%). Subgroup analysis of the studies excluding the two smallest studies in the group (<LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>) found the results homogenous, but with no statistically significant difference between aripiprazole and typical drugs (n=1263, 4 RCT, RR 0.97 CI 0.9 to 1.1).</P>
<P>2.5 Mental state - continuous outcomes<BR/>2.5.1 Improvement in BPRS total score<BR/>There were no statistically significant differences between aripiprazole and typical antipsychotic drugs in terms of improvement in BPRS total scores (n=412, 2 RCT, WMD 1.07 CI -2.1 to 4.2).</P>
<P>2.5.2 Improvement in PANSS total score<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> provided usable data for improvement in total PANSS scores. Participants receiving aripiprazole showed greater improvement in PANSS total scores than those on typical antipsychotic drugs but the differences were not statistically significant (n=300, 1 RCT, WMD 0.70 CI -4.1 to 5.5).</P>
<P>2.6 Adverse effects: extra-pyramidal symptoms<BR/>2.6.1 EPS-related adverse event<BR/>Twelve percent of participants given aripiprazole developed an EPS-related adverse event compared with 20% of those on typical antipsychotics. The results though statistically significant were heterogeneous (n=968, 3 RCT, RR 0.46 CI 0.3 to 0.9, I 69.1%, NNT 13 CI 10 to 17). If the study with the most extreme result (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>) was excluded from the analysis the results became homogenous but remained significantly in favour of aripiprazole (n=608, 2 RCT, RR 0.58 CI 0.4 to 0.8, NNT 11 CI 8 to 17).</P>
<P>2.6.2 Akathisia<BR/>Rates of akathisia were significantly less common in participants receiving aripiprazole (5%) compared with typical antipsychotics (14%) (n=897, 3 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 11 CI 9 to 14).</P>
<P>2.6.3 Hypertonia<BR/>We found no significant difference for the frequency of hypertonia between aripiprazole (3%) and typical antipsychotics (4%) (n=597, 2 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.04 to 6.3).</P>
<P>2.6.4 Tremor<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported usable data about incidence of tremor as an adverse side-effect. We found no significant difference between participants given aripiprazole (3%) and those receiving typical antipsychotics (7%) (n=308, 1 RCT, RR 0.36 CI 0.1 to 1.1).</P>
<P>2.7 Adverse effects: other symptoms<BR/>2.7.1 Abdominal pain<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported usable data for abdominal pain as an adverse effect. We found no significant differences between aripiprazole (7%) and typical antipsychotic drugs (6%) (n=308, RR 1.27 CI 0.5 to 3.2).</P>
<P>2.7.2 Abnormal total CPK levels<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> recorded abnormal CPK levels and we found no significant difference between aripiprazole (8%) compared with perphenazine (5%) (n=300, RR 1.63 CI 0.7 to 4.0).</P>
<P>2.7.3 Agitation<BR/>About 7% of participants receiving aripiprazole and 9% of those given typical drugs suffered agitation during the trial period, but the differences were not statistically significant (n=949, 3 RCT, RR 0.99 CI 0.6 to 1.5).</P>
<P>2.7.4 Anxiety<BR/>Outcomes for anxiety were equivocal between aripiprazole and typical antipsychotics (n=608, 2 RCTs, RR 0.95 CI 0.7 to 1.4).</P>
<P>2.7.5 Asthenia (tiredness)<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported asthenia as an adverse effect and we found data to be equivocal between aripiprazole (4%) and haloperidol (5%) (n=308, RR 0.92 CI 0.3 to 2.7).</P>
<P>2.7.6 Blurred vision<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported usable data for incidence of blurred vision as an adverse effect. We found blurred vision to be significantly less common in participants given aripiprazole (2%) compared with the haloperidol group (8%) (n=308, RR 0.19 CI 0.1 to 0.7, NNT 14 CI 10 to 25).</P>
<P>2.7.7 Clinically significantly raised prolactin levels<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> aripiprazole (4%) caused significantly fewer cases of clinically significantly raised prolactin levels compared to perphenazine (54%) (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.07 CI 0.03 to 0.2, NNT 2 CI 1 to 3).</P>
<P>2.7.8 Dizziness<BR/>Aripiprazole caused dizziness in significantly more participants (10%) than typical drugs (5%) (n=957, 3 RCT, RR 1.88 CI 1.1 to 3.2, NNH 20 CI 14 to 33).</P>
<P>2.7.9 Dyspepsia<BR/>Dyspepsia was reported as an adverse effect in only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>. Ten percent of participants randomised to aripiprazole experienced dyspepsia compared to 6% of those to perphenazine, but the differences were not statistically significant (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 1.69 CI 0.8 to 3.7).</P>
<P>2.7.10 Headache<BR/>Headaches were a common adverse effect amongst those on aripiprazole (16%) and typical drugs (11%), though the results were not statistically significantly different (n=1257, 4 RCT, RR 1.32 CI 0.8 to 2.1).</P>
<P>2.7.11 Increase in CPK levels<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported cases of increased CPK levels from baseline among the aripiprazole group (6%) and typical drugs (3%) and the small differences were not statistically significant (n=300, RR 2.13 CI 0.7 to 6.8).</P>
<P>2.7.12 Insomnia<BR/>Insomnia appeared almost as often in those on aripiprazole (17%) as in those on typical antipsychotic drugs (18%), but the results were not significantly different (n=968, 3 RCT, RR 0.84 CI 0.5 to 1.3).</P>
<P>2.7.13 Nausea<BR/>Nausea occurred significantly more frequently in those receiving aripiprazole (9%) compared with those on typical antipsychotic drugs (3%) (n=957, 3 RCT, RR 3.03 CI 1.5 to 6.1, NNH 17 CI 13 to 25).</P>
<P>2.7.14 Orthostatic hypotension<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported usable data for orthostatic hypotension. We found no greater incidence of asthenia among people randomised to aripiprazole (4%) compared with those on haloperidol (1%) (n=308, RR 4.59 CI 0.6 to 35.7).</P>
<P>2.7.15 Pain at injection site<BR/>Aripiprazole (2%) did not cause a significantly greater occurrence of local pain at the injection site compared with those receiving typical drug injections (1%) (n=649, 2 RCT, RR 2.80 CI 0.7 to 11.3).</P>
<P>2.7.16 Psychosis<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported usable data about the incidence of psychosis during the study. We found no significant difference between the two comparator groups in the incidence of psychosis (n=300, RR 1.58 CI 0.7 to 3.5).</P>
<P>2.7.17 QTc abnormalities<BR/>About 1% of participants given aripiprazole and typical antipsychotic drugs developed QTc abnormalities, but the results were not statistically significant (n=1257, 4 RCT, RR 0.37 CI 0.03 to 4.4).</P>
<P>2.7.18 Sinus tachycardia<BR/>We found significantly fewer cases of sinus tachycardia in the aripiprazole (0.4%) group compared with typical drugs (5%) (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, n=289, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.8, NNT 22 CI 13 to 63).</P>
<P>2.7.19 Somnolence<BR/>We found no significant difference for the frequency of somnolence between aripiprazole (6%) and typical antipsychotic (8%) (n=1257, 4 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.4 to 1.0).</P>
<P>2.7.20 Tachycardia<BR/>Incidences of tachycardia were not significantly more common in participants given aripiprazole (4%) compared with typical drugs (2%) (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, n= 289, RR 2.30 CI 0.3 to 17.8).</P>
<P>2.7.21 Vomiting<BR/>Incidences of vomiting were equally common (7%) in participants receiving aripiprazole and typical antipsychotic drugs (n=597, 2 RCT, RR 1.30 CI 0.7 to 2.5).</P>
<P>2.7.22 Weight gain<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> defined clinically significant weight gain as &gt;7% increase in body weight from baseline. Aripiprazole caused fewer participants (5%) to gain weight compared with haloperidol (10%) but the differences were not statistically significant (n=308, 1RCT, RR 0.56 CI 0.3 to 1.3).</P>
<P>2.8 Satisfaction with treatment: leaving study early due to withdrawal of consent<BR/>Significantly fewer participants given aripiprazole (12%) left the study early due to withdrawal of consent compared with those on typical drugs (15%) (n=919, 4 RCT, RR 0.70 CI 0.5 to 1.0, NNH 33 CI 20 to 100).</P>
<P>2.9 Quality of Life: clinically significant improvement in QLS score<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> described clinically significant improvement in QLS score as &#8805;20% increase from baseline score. We found significantly greater numbers (36%) of participants given aripiprazole compared to those on perphenazine (21%) were noted to have significantly improved QLS score (n=300, RR 0.82 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 4 to 31).</P>
<P>2.10 Concomitant drug treatment<BR/>Fewer participants receiving aripiprazole (13%) required concomitant antimuscarinic medication compared with those on typical drugs (33%), but the results were heterogeneous and the differences were not statistically significant (n=412, 2 RCT, RR 0.13 CI 0.00 to 9.6, I 89.4%). In <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> we found fewer cases of concomitant use of additional antipsychotic medication amongst the aripiprazole group (3%) compared with the typical antipsychotics (6%) but the results were not statistically significant (n=308, 1 RCT, RR 0.51 CI 0.2 to 1.5). In <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> we found that patients given aripiprazole (8%) did not require concomitant benzodiazepines significantly more often compared with typical drugs (12%) (n=360, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.4 to 1.3).<BR/>
<BR/>2.11 Leaving study early<BR/>2.11.1 Discontinuation due to any reason<BR/>Nineteen percent of participants left the study early in both comparator groups and there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups (n=1686, 7 RCT, RR 0.92 CI 0.8 to 1.1).</P>
<P>2.11.2 Discontinuation due to an adverse event including psychosis<BR/>Six percent of participants in the aripiprazole group and 7% of those given typical antipsychotic drugs discontinued from the study due to an adverse event with psychosis being the most common adverse effect which led to discontinuation.

<P>2.11.4 Discontinuation due to marked deterioration<BR/>Four percent of participants receiving aripiprazole and 3% of those on typical antipsychotics discontinued from the study due to marked deterioration, but the differences were not statistically significant (n=423, 3 RCT, RR 0.90 CI 0.3 to 2.5).</P>
<P>2.11.5 Discontinuation due to non-compliance with study protocol<BR/>Only 1% of participants given aripiprazole discontinued from the trials due to non-compliance with study protocol compared to none of those allocated to the typical antipsychotic group, and were not statistically significant (n=311, 2 RCT, RR 1.79 CI 0.2 to 16.9).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:02:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Small number of studies<BR/>The condition of schizophrenia is difficult to study and co-operation from the study population is rare. Aripiprazole is a relatively new drug. This may be one of the reasons for the relative scarcity of controlled clinical trials comparing aripiprazole with typical drugs.</P>
<P>2. Quality of trials<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> described adequate methods of randomised allocation and double-blinding and scored three on the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). None of the other trials described the randomisation procedure and did not score highly on the Jadad scale indicating moderate risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> did not describe randomisation allocation and blinding, nor withdrawals and drop-outs; and scored one on the Jadad scale.</P>
<P>3. Publication bias<BR/>The data included in this review were insufficient to enter into a funnel plot and so we could not address the possibility of publication bias.</P>
<P>4. Generalisability of findings<BR/>Three (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>) of the nine included studies occurred exclusively in North America. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> took place in a North American and Canadian multicentre setting. <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> was conducted in multiple centres worldwide. Although it could not be definitely determined from the limited descriptions of the remaining three multicentre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>) it is likely that they took place in a similar environment. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> appears to have been conducted in China. Clinicians should take this into consideration when thinking of using aripiprazole in very different settings of care.<BR/>
<BR/>Six (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McCue 2006</LINK>) of the nine included studies were conducted in an in-patient setting. <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK> used an out-patient setting. The setting of the remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>) remains unclear. The majority of trials involved inpatient participants with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity and with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care, where people who are not in hospital and suffer from less well defined illness combined with problems such as depression and substance abuse are the norm.</P>
<P>The drugs of comparison used in the trials in this review further limit the applicability of its findings. These were of a nature, or used at such a dose, that they distance these trials from everyday practice even more. The reader is subsequently left with the difficult decision as to whether the findings of studies with such over-defined participants, interventions and outcomes and standardised highly developed inpatient settings can still inform routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>5. Limited data, confusing data<BR/>The collection and quality of the available data varied. We were often unable to use data because of high drop-out rates. The enormous degree of loss to follow up is common in similar studies of other compounds, but rare in everyday practice. This also casts doubt on the applicability of findings to routine care. The design of the studies is clearly encouraging loss to follow up. People leave for many reasons, often not specified, and their last observation is carried forward to the end. These data are nevertheless acceptable to the regulatory authorities. Until this ends, pharmaceutical companies will see little reason to change their practices, as compounds such as aripiprazole will gain licenses for clinical use even if 40% of their data is unavailable.</P>
<P>Often the trialists do not have an obligation to follow people up for longer than the period during which they took the medication. One possible consequence of this might be that an extreme adverse reaction to discontinuation of an intervention, such as death, would go unreported if it occurred a week after the treatment stopped. Data beyond the discontinuation of the medications used within the trial may have been collected but were not reported. This data should be reported since it is not just the individual compounds in a trial which are randomised but the intention to give those individual compounds.</P>
<P>Where scales were employed the degree of improvement was proportional to the change in number of points recorded on each scale. This does not necessarily reflect a satisfactory degree of improvement as would be defined by<BR/>carers, patients or their families. Trialists tended to report mean figures without giving standard deviations. This renders averages meaningless for re-analysis and of no use to reviewers.</P>
<P>Several trials only reported adverse effects which occurred in at least 5% of participants which could exclude potentially serious less frequent outcomes. Randomised trials are limited in their ability to highlight important rare outcomes, so further restricting what is reported seems odd. We note that the design of the trials did not limit reporting of positive outcomes to only those that occurred at least 5% of the time.</P>
<P>We found it disappointing that no outcome data were available on service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services and cognitive functioning. We used relapse as our primary outcome but none of the studies reported relapse data. Other outcomes were of secondary importance to this review, but we have reported what we can in order to present the most complete data set possible for the reader. Along with the poor reporting of data, the limited outcomes recorded greatly lessens not so much the applicability, but the value of this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Currier-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Currier 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2007</LINK> which may have been of use in the review could not be included due to lack of usable data. <LINK REF="STD-Ao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ao 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhuang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhuang 2006</LINK> may have provided valuable data, but we were unable to translate the papers from Chinese. We intend to make further attempts to translate these papers and obtain other vital information for future updates of this review.</P>
<P>6. Duration of trials<BR/>With the exception of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>), no studies reported outcomes over 26 weeks and all others lasted less than 12 weeks. Aripiprazole is a relatively new compound, so it is not surprising that long term studies are rare at this point but it is to be hoped that they are planned. The difference in duration between trials, 24 hours to 52 weeks influences the outcomes measured. Even if an intervention works in the short term (by 12 weeks) there is no guarantee that this means that the compound has long term benefits.</P>
<P>7.COMPARISON 1: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (short term &lt; / = 12 weeks).<BR/>7.1 Death<BR/>No deaths occurred among participants allocated to treatment with either aripiprazole or typical antipsychotic drugs in the short term.</P>
<P>7.2 Global state<BR/>No data were available for relapse. Aripiprazole and perphenazine appeared equally potent in decreasing the severity of the illness and improving the global clinical impression.</P>
<P>7.3 Mental state<BR/>There was little evidence to support the superiority or inferiority of aripiprazole compared to typical drugs in effecting a clinically significant response to treatment, and in improving mental state as defined by changes in BPRS and PANSS scale scores. This, along with similar improvement in clinical global impressions suggests that aripiprazole is an efficacious antipsychotic drug.</P>
<P>7.4 Adverse effects: extra-pyramidal symptoms<BR/>Aripiprazole caused significantly less instances of an extra-pyramidal symptom related adverse event than typical antipsychotics. Considering haloperidol's propensity to cause movement disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2004</LINK>), this is not surprising. However the results were heterogeneous, and the NNT (NNT 13 CI 10 to 17) could be regarded as clinically significant given the distressing nature of these adverse effects. Excluding the study with the most extreme result (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>) from the analysis produced homogenous data which remained significantly in favour of aripiprazole (NNT 11 CI 8 to 17). Aripiprazole presented a significant advantage over typical drugs with regard to akathisia as a treatment emergent adverse effect (NNT 11 CI 9 to 14). There were no greater risks caused by aripiprazole compared with typical drugs in the occurrence of tremor and hypertonia. No objective rating scales appear to have been used consistently in all the included studies to measure these symptoms, even though for extrapyramidal side effects these are commonly used in research. The outcome scores of the Simpson-Angus scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement scale and Barnes Akathisia scale reported in some studies could not be used in the analysis due to unavailability of standard deviations and mean scores.</P>
<P>7.5 Adverse effects: other symptoms<BR/>7.5.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects<BR/>The adverse effects were those spontaneously reported in at least 5% of people, and, as stated earlier, this method of recording may exclude potentially serious, less frequent problems. Dizziness (NNH 20 CI 14 to 33) and nausea (NNH 17 CI 13 to 25) were significantly more common among those taking aripiprazole compared with those on typical drugs. Given the unpleasant nature of these symptoms these findings could be regarded as clinically significant. Only <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000</LINK> reported an advantage with aripiprazole over haloperidol in causing blurred vision as an adverse side-effect (NNT 14 CI 10 to 25). There was no statistically significant difference between aripiprazole and typical drugs in terms of occurrence of anxiety, agitation, asthenia, headache, psychosis, insomnia or somnolence. Vomiting, abdominal pain and dyspepsia were equally common in both comparator groups. Weight gain data were not significantly more common among patients allocated to aripiprazole compared with typical drugs. Local pain at the injection site occurred as commonly with aripiprazole as typical antipsychotic drugs. More well-designed and reported studies are required to further determine any differential emergence of adverse effects in the two comparator groups.</P>
<P>7.5.2 Physiological (serum) measures<BR/>Serum CPK levels were not differentially affected by aripiprazole and typical antipsychotic drugs. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> suggests a clinically significant advantage for aripiprazole over perphenazine in causing raised serum prolactin levels (NNT 2 CI 1 to 3). However mean prolactin levels were elevated in both groups at baseline. Mean prolactin levels decreased during treatment with aripiprazole in more people than with perphenazine. This finding may have important clinical implications with reference to the problems caused by hyperprolactinaemia, such as galactorrhoea and osteoporosis.<BR/>
<BR/>7.5.3 Cardio-vascular effects<BR/>Aripiprazole produced sinus tachycardia in fewer people than the typical antipsychotic drugs (NNT 22 CI 13 to 63). Even though the number-needed-to-treat is high, the nature of the symptom makes the difference clinically significant. It is important to note that these results were derived from only one study. Participants receiving aripiprazole were not more likely than those given typical drugs to experience orthostatic hypotension, QTc abnormalities and tachycardia due to unspecified reasons.</P>
<P>7.6 Satisfaction with treatment: leaving study early due to withdrawal of consent<BR/>More people given aripiprazole appeared to be satisfied with treatment and withdrew their consent for the study less frequently than did those on typical antipsychotic drugs (NNH 33 CI 20 to 100). However the clinical applicability of these findings is limited in the absence of information about specific reasons for dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>7.7 Quality of Life: clinically significant improvement in QLS score<BR/>More people on aripiprazole perceived a change for the better in their perceived quality of life compared to those on perphenazine (NNT 7 CI 4 to 31). This may be interpreted as a significant observation with important implications for patient satisfaction and compliance, but the wide confidence interval reduces the clinical significance of the finding. However the mean change in Quality of Life scale scores were more favourably inclined towards perphenazine. These findings may be an example of the pharmaceutical industry presenting the data in a more favourable light than any real gains achieved.</P>
<P>7.8 Concomitant drug treatment<BR/>Participants given aripiprazole did not require significantly greater amounts of additional concomitant antimuscarinic, antipsychotic or benzodiazepine medication compared with those receiving typical antipsychotic drugs. However we were unable to identify clear methods about the determination of the doses of the comparator drugs; nor ascertain any objective criteria for administration of concomitant adjunctive medication. The clinical applicability of these findings remains limited.<BR/>
<BR/>7.9 Leaving study early<BR/>Participants who were given aripiprazole did not discontinue from the study in the short term more often due to an adverse event, development of psychosis, lack of efficacy or marked deterioration, or non-compliance with study protocol compared to those treated with typical antipsychotic drugs. Haloperidol was the comparator typical antipsychotic in all the studies included in this analysis apart from <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> which compares aripiprazole to perphenazine. These data are homogenous and suggest that aripiprazole is an effective antipsychotic drug. But the equally moderate numbers of participants in both comparator groups who left the study early due to any reason suggest that aripiprazole may not offer any significant advantage over typical antipsychotic drugs in terms of tolerability in the short term.</P>
<P>8. COMPARISON 2: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus TYPICALS ( medium / long term &gt; 12 weeks ).<BR/>8.1 Death<BR/>Deaths were rare and do not appear to be significantly more or less common among participants taking aripiprazole compared with those on typical drugs. Further well-designed and reported studies of longer duration will hopefully shed light on this very important outcome.</P>
<P>8.2 Global state<BR/>There were no data available for relapse or changes in global functioning in the long term.<BR/>
<BR/>8.3 Leaving study early<BR/>Large numbers of participants in both the aripiprazole and typical groups left the study early due to any reason, but significantly fewer participants in the aripiprazole arm (57%) left the study early compared with those on typical antipsychotic drugs (70%) (n=1294, 1 RCT, RR 0.81 CI 0.8 to 0.9 NNT 8 CI 5 to 14). Aripiprazole appeared to be at a clinically significant advantage compared to typical drugs in terms of the attrition rate due to any reason (NNT 8 CI 5 to 14). Participants on aripiprazole did not discontinue from the study more often due to lack of efficacy or marked deterioration as compared to those on typical antipsychotic drugs. Aripiprazole appeared to confer an advantage over typical antipsychotic drugs in terms of discontinuation due to the occurrence of an adverse event including psychosis (NNT 14 CI 8 to 100), but the results may not be clinically significant due to the relatively large number-needed-to-treat and wide confidence interval. Aripiprazole appears to afford a clinically significant advantage over typical antipsychotic drugs in terms of potential non-compliance in the long-term, as evident in discontinuation rates due to non-compliance with study protocol (NNT 9 CI 7 to 14).</P>
<P>Data from studies where huge levels of attrition are deemed acceptable are clinically meaningless and clinicians and recipients of care are left with no reliable information upon which to base decisions.<BR/>When leaving the study early was attributed to the occurrence of adverse effects, marked deterioration or lack of efficacy there were no significant differences between groups. These findings indicate that aripiprazole may confer greater advantage over the older drugs in encouraging long-term compliance.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:56:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> 1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Aripiprazole is not clearly more or less effective than typical antipsychotics in terms of improving global outcomes or mental state. However it confers a significant advantage over older drugs in terms of fewer occurrences of extra-pyramidal symptom related adverse events, but it is more likely to cause dizziness and nausea. Hyperprolactinaemia and associated complications of unpleasant breast pain and secretion and osteoporosis do not seem to be a significant concern with aripiprazole; while they remain adverse effects commonly seen with the older drugs. There appears to be a lesser chance of developing sinus tachycardia whilst taking aripiprazole even though it does not present any significant advantages over the typical drugs in causing QTc abnormalities. </P>
<P> 2. For clinicians<BR/>Aripiprazole appears to be as efficacious and effective as the comparator typical antipsychotic drugs in the included studies. It presents a significantly favourable adverse effect profile when compared to the older drugs. This suggests a significant advantage over typical drugs in ensuring compliance. However aripiprazole has been compared to haloperidol, perphenazine, and chlorpromazine in the studies included in this review and a sensitivity analysis could not be conducted due to lack of adequate relevant data; it cannot therefore be definitively concluded that it is as effective as or better tolerated than all typical antipsychotic drugs at various dose ranges. More studies are needed to replicate and validate these findings. </P>
<P> 3. For managers / policy makers<BR/>No data has emerged about service outcomes. Data about economic outcomes are minimal and insignificant. Even though aripiprazole appears to be an efficacious and effective drug there is inadequate data about medium and long-term outcomes. In the context of finite resources, the lack of good quality data leaves managers and policy makers with difficult decisions to make. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:02:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. General<BR/>As with all similar studies, public registration of a study before anyone is randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Unique study numbers would help researchers to identify single studies from multiple publications and reduce the risk of duplicating the reporting of data. Compliance with CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), both on the part of authors and editors, would help to clarify methodology and ensure outcome data were more transparent and usable. Failure to comply produces loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians, patients or managers.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis should be performed on all outcomes and all trial data should be made easily accessible. A minimal requirement should be that all data should, at least, be presented as numbers. In addition, continuous data should be presented with means, standard deviations (or standard errors) and the number of participants. Data from graphs, 'p' values of differences and statements of significant or non-significant differences are of limited value. Unfortunately, in spite of the large numbers of participants randomised, we were unable to use most of the data in the trials included in this review due to the high drop-out rates observed as well as poor data reporting.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>As an antipsychotic agent with a novel mechanism of action, aripiprazole is an interesting compound, but pragmatic, real world, randomised controlled trials should be carried out to determine its value in standard clinical practice. Studies of medium and long-term risks, including mortality, behaviour, satisfaction with treatment and cost-effectiveness-in comparison to typical and atypical antipsychotics, are a priority. Pragmatic entry criteria and non-blinding with hard endpoints may be helpful in decreasing the study attrition (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 1998</LINK>).</P>
