We have a query over reporting change scores. I have removed negative signs in Metaview and switched the axes. Is this legitimate for change scores? On this occasion perhaps not an issue, but for future reference, how can we deal with change scores which are going in opposite directions? Can negative signs be used then? &lt;br&gt;Toby,&lt;br&gt;I am not clear exactly what data you have entered here. Is the change in Bronchial hyperresponsiveness a percentage decrease? If so it should have a negative sign! Likewise what are the units of PEak flow amplitude (is this a diurnal variation?). Cross-over data used so is this first arm data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15/3/2002&lt;br&gt;Technical Editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;Authors and contributions: - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Citations for the included studies are missing.

No significant differences were detected between active intervention and control on most primary and secondary outcome measures. There was a significant response when BHR was measured by van der Heide 1999, and compared with baseline data. Data on absence from school or work were not reported in either study. &lt;br&gt;IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE ACTIVE RESPONSE IS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL NOT JUST TO BASELINE, OTHERWISE THE SIGNIFICANCE IS SPURIOUS.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REMOVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic searches yielded a total of 34 references. Of these, three were identified as potentially relevant (van der Heide 1999, Wood 1998). One study was excluded (van der Heide 1997). Upon searching the bibliography of these studies, 5 further reports were identified and retrieved for possible inclusion in this review, however none met the inclusion criteria (see Excluded Studies). &lt;br&gt;WHY WAS VAN DER HEIDE 97 EXCLUDED PLEASE&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;NOW CLEARER&lt;br&gt;1. Study design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both van der Heide 1999 and Wood 1998 were randomised, double blind placebo controlled studies. Wood 1998 was a parallel designed study and van der Heide 1999 was designed as a cross-over study, but analysed as a parallel study. &lt;br&gt;WAS THIS ANALYSIS BY THE AUTHORS OF THE PAPER (IF SO WHY) OR BY THE REVIEWERS?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;CLEARER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYMPTOM SCORES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood 1998 reported no significant changes in symptom scores in either the placebo or active groups. Mean values were provided as unpublished by Dr Wood for chest and nasal symptom scores in the asthmatic participants. The p values provided with these data did not reach significance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeping difficulty data were also provided for asthmatic participants for Wood 1998. 12% and 4% asthma sufferers in the placebo and active group respectively reported difficulty with sleeping during the study. &lt;br&gt;ARE THESE DICHOTOMOUS DATA SUITABLE FOR INCLUSION IN REVMAN? LOOKS TO ME AS IF THEY COULD GO IN.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PUT IN AND METAVIEW DOES MATCH THE TEXT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood 1998 found no significant difference between the active and control arms of the study after adjusting for baseline. van der Heide 1999 reported that AHR was significantly decreased after intervention but not after control. Direct comparison between active and control groups was not calculated. Change from baseline may have been a fairer comparison for such a small heterogeneous population, but such data were not reported. Data were log transformed due to uneven distribution. Consequently, the forest plot pertaining to BHR should be regarded with caution. &lt;br&gt;IN VIEW OF THIS THE RESULT IN THE ABSTRACT SHOULD BE REMOVED AS IT IS MISLEADING IN MY VIEW. DIRECT COMPARISON BETWEEN ACTIVE AND CONTROL IS THE ONLY VALID COMPARISON. WHAT DATA WENT INTO METAVIEW FOR THIS COMPARISON BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE COMPARING ACTIVE AND CONTROL GROUPS SO DOES NOT TALLY WITH THE TEXT?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added Claire Allen to the acknowlegdements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23/3/2002&lt;br&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;br&gt; Mike McKean has OK'd this now.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Some people with asthma who own pets can be allergic to the dander that accumulates in and around the home. Certain guidelines recommend the removal of pets as the most effective way of reducing exposure to the allergens emanating from their hair and skin. Other measures have been proposed as an alternative to pet removal, such as pet washing, sprays and air filtration units. The aim of these interventions is to lower the amount of allergen in the air and on the floor of the home, and so limit the risk of asthma symptoms worsening. Very little research of a high quality has been published on this topic, and the current evidence is not sufficiently reliable to draw firm conclusions. Further research should consider the effectiveness of pet washing, sprays and possibly pet removal from the home.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Although pet removal has been recommended in guidelines on the management of allergic asthma, pet ownership remains high in families where one or more members have an allergy to pet dander. Allergen control measures such as air filtration units placed in the homes of pet-allergic asthmatics have been used as a means of reducing allergen exposure.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy of pet allergen control measures in the homes of people with pet-allergic asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-26 15:53:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We carried out an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials. No restriction was placed on language of publication. Searches are current as of September 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing an active allergen reduction measure with control were considered for analysis. Participants had stable pet-allergic asthma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers extracted data independently. Only a limited amount of data could be analysed and no meta-analysis was possible. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Both examined the effectiveness of air filtration units. Both trials were small (n = 22 and n = 35). No significant differences were detected between active intervention and control on the primary and secondary outcome measures reported in the studies. Data on absence from school or work were not reported in either study. No meta-analysis could be performed due to lack of common outcomes. An update search conducted in September 2006 did not identify any further trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-15 15:45:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The available trials are too small to provide evidence for or against the use of air filtration units to reduce allergen levels in the management of pet-allergic asthma. Adequately powered trials are needed. There are no trials of other allergen reduction measures, such as pet washing or possibly pet removal.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-26 16:01:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma can be defined by its major clinical symptoms, variable airflow obstruction and reversibility (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>). The etiology of the disease is complex and is attributable to both genetic and environmental influences. It is widely recognised that in Western countries atopy is associated with asthma with just over 50% of asthmatic adults and children having at least one positive skin prick test to a common allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-Lynn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour Lynn 1999</LINK>). There is evidence that atopy is a predictor of asthma in children (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1962</LINK>), but its role has yet to be fully elucidated (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Mutius-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Mutius 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>In Western countries up to 40% of adults or children (two to four years) with atopy and asthma may be sensitised to cat (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1996</LINK>). Inhalation challenge studies in the laboratory setting demonstrate that contact with cat allergen can induce respiratory symptoms in those with cat allergy and asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Wanger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanger 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>It would appear that the allergenic components of cat dander are relatively stable in house dust and are difficult to remove with regular cleaning (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1962</LINK>). Cat allergen is also found in unexpected places such as dust in schools (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1962</LINK>). It would seem that cat allergen is ubiquitous in societies where cat ownership is common, and indeed the community prevalence of cat shows a correlation with the community prevalence of respiratory symptoms and sensitisation prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Roost-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roost 1999</LINK>). However, the contribution that the real life 'challenge' of pet ownership has on respiratory symptoms compared to what is present in the community, is unclear.</P>
<P>Some guidelines for asthma indicate that pets especially cats should be removed from the homes of those with specific allergies and asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>), but others do not (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prodigy" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prodigy</LINK>). Anecdotally compliance with pet removal is reported to be poor. "Rather than dictatorial, it is best for the families to come to decisions about removing pets themselves. This may be helped by providing objective evidence." (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-Lynn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour Lynn 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>In those families that choose to keep the pet some techniques aimed at reducing indoor allergen load are available. Methods focused on the source include washing or wiping the pet with and without chemical agents and those focused on airborne and dust allergen reservoirs include air filtration and chemical cleaning agents (<LINK REF="REF-Avner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Custovic-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Custovic 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review attempts to summarise the evidence for the effectiveness of any measures to reduce pet allergen exposure on reducing the symptoms of asthma associated with pet allergy.</P>

The study duration in the <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> study was four months in total. Following a one-month run in, patients were treated with active or placebo filters for three months with no follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK> had a one week run in and a treatment period of six months with cross-over at three months.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Populations </HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> recruited 38 adult patients with allergic asthma and/or rhinitis associated with cats. Thirty five patients were randomised to the two treatment groups, three having been excluded during the one month run-in. Asthma was defined as respiratory symptoms (either asthma or rhinitis) requiring regular medication use on more than 50% days. Severe asthmatics were excluded but no definition of severe was cited as these data were obtained by questionnaire. Sensitisation to pet allergen was established by cat specific skin prick test and a history of developing symptoms on exposure to cat. A skin prick test was undertaken which consisted of several allergens (dust mite, cat, dog, cockroach, molds, grass, tree and ragweed pollen), and this was used to determine other coexistent allergies. Participants were enrolled outside of the pollen season for which they had had an allergic reaction, or were not enrolled if part of the study period included part of the pollen season. Participants who planned to be away from their domicile for more than one week during the study period were excluded. A subgroup of asthmatics were defined as methacholine reactive (N = 23). Participants were recruited from the community via a newspaper advertisement.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK> recruited 22 children with mild asthma (mean FEV1 90.2 +/-11.2 % predicted) who were allergic to cat or dog. There were two drop outs, both due to changes in inhaled steroid medication. Asthma was defined as 'moderate' although participants had minimal symptoms on inhaled steroids and all participants were responsive to adenosine monophosphate. Particpants were enrolled provided they were sensitised to cat or dog allergen (RAST class &gt; or = two units). The study period was out of the pollen season (September to April), and this study also included participants with perennial allergies. Participants were excluded from the study if they changed their medication. No patients had viral upper respiratory tract infections during the study period, but it is unclear if this was an inclusion criterion. Participants were recruited from an outpatient paediatric chest clinic.</P>
<P>Neither study gave data for the total eligible population or the number that declined to consent.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions </HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> used a Honeywell envirocare HEPA filter used in the bedroom alone, with the capacity for 15 changes of air per hour in an average bedroom (350 cubic feet per minute). In both treatment groups, participants' pillow and mattress were encased with impervious covers, and they were instructed to wash bedding once a week and keep the cats from entering the bedroom at all times by keeping the door shut. Compliance was closely monitored, with a timing device inserted into the HEPA filter and a regular visit by a study investigator to ensure that the device was used. Participants were excluded from the trial if they failed to comply with any of the environmental allergen control measures. The control intervention consisted of an identical HEPA unit with the filter removed. This sounded and looked identical to the active HEPA unit.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK> used a Phillips air cleaner in the living room and the bedroom and no additional control measures were used. Active and placebo units were identical, other than the absence of the active filter in the placebo unit.</P>

<P>The published data did not enable us to conduct a meta-analysis.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-26 16:01:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review has not found sufficient objective evidence to support or refute the use of measures for allergen control, which aim to benefit patients with pet allergic asthma. The studies had some methodological limitations but extensive efforts were made in both instances to blind the patients to whether the treatment they received was active or placebo.</P>
<P>The studies were small with no sample size calculations shown, and as such they may have been underpowered. The authors were unable to conduct a meta-analysis with the two studies included, and so any overall treatment effect may not be detected until further studies are conducted with similar outcomes to those measured in these studies. In the Cochrane review on house dust mite reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2008</LINK>), one subgroup analysis detected a significant effect (asthma symptom scores - parallel group trials) and whilst this significant effect may have occurred by chance, meta-analysis can overcome inadequately powered trials by combining data from more than one trial (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>). This is possible with regard to the interventions analysed in this review, but impossible to prove without further adequately powered studies.</P>
<P>The presence of co-interventions aimed at reducing contact with allergens in the <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> study may also have compromised the detection of a clear treatment effect in favour of the filter. Further research in the area of allergen avoidance measures should take into account the possibility that concomitant 'active' measures may confound the overall efficacy of the intervention in question. The design of the excluded <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK> study did account for this to a certain degree, with three groups allocated to: active filter, impermeable mattress covers plus placebo filter; and active filters plus impermeable mattress covers. In that study participants with an allergic reaction to house dust mite allergen were included, among whom there were several pet allergic participants. Pet ownership was not a specified entry criteria, and it is difficult to conclude whether air filter and mattress covers used in that study would improve symptoms of pet allergic asthmatics where pets were present. Four cat-owning pet-allergic participants whose PC 20 improved following the introduction of the filter and mattress covers were also highly sensitised to house dust mite and grass pollen. Reducing exposure to any of these allergens may therefore induce a positive response.</P>
<P>The populations chosen for <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK> were mild and stable on current medication, the baseline symptom scores were minimal and the FEV% predicted averaged at 90.2% at baseline. The implications for a clear demonstration of treatment efficacy may be more difficult in this population of asthmatics, given their relatively healthy status at the start of the trial. In <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> the population was considered to be symptomatic, and subgroup analysis was performed groups on for high and low maintenance therapy groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> changes in medication use were based on outcome measure but there is no indication that patient medication was regularly reviewed in a systematic manner. In the <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK> study, patients whose medication altered over the course of the study were withdrawn from the final analysis, and so the effect on medication usage could not be measured in this review.</P>
<P>This review does not attempt to summarise the evidence on the effectiveness of control measures to reduce allergen concentrations in the air or dust of homes housing pets. Indeed as little is known about what allergen concentration would be 'safe' for a typical asthmatic that aim would be futile. The included studies did compare settled dust concentration of Fel d 1, but found no significant difference between homes with placebo or active filters. Even airborne allergen concentrations were not significantly different in placebo or active filter groups.</P>
<P>Non-compliance with treatment protocol was taken into account by <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK> and a subgroup analysis for compliant participants was subsequently conducted. Even in this group the reduction in mean allergen concentration only just reaches significance. Compliance was assessed by a home visit to determine if cats were excluded from the bedrooms and mattress and pillow covers maintained. Timer devices were also installed in the filters to determine for how long they had been left to run. This population had been screened for poor compliance during the one month baseline period and had consented to participate in the study. Consequently, compliance would be expected to be higher than in the normal clinical setting. Further studies of adequate sample size may give a clearer answer to this question. In <LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2008</LINK>, one study (<LINK REF="REF-Huss-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huss 1992</LINK>) examined the additional benefit of a computer assisted education programme to instruct the participants in the study on allergen avoidance. However, this was not found to improve asthma symptoms at all timepoints. In this review the possible role of an education programme has not been evaluated, but could be considered by future studies.</P>
<P>Other interventions that were represented in the literature that we reviewed included pet washing. Pre- and post-treatment comparisons of washing cats (<LINK REF="REF-Avner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avner 1997</LINK>) or dogs (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 1999</LINK>) by immersion in water or shampooing showed a reduction in the shedding of allergen in the short term, but this is not maintained and would need repeating twice weekly (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 1999</LINK>). Chemical wipes are perhaps even less effective (<LINK REF="REF-Perzanowski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perzanowski 1997</LINK>), although presumably easier to use. The impact upon asthma needs to be measured in future studies.</P>
<P>Until a rigorous study of successful allergen concentration reduction has been conducted, the impact of such devices as a HEPA filtration unit on health status remain unclear. Pollution may also have an affect on asthma in patients who experience exacerbations or a worsening of symptoms when exposed to environmental triggers. Some research on the impact of traffic pollution on the respiratory system, has described a hypothesis that diesel particles may have an impact on allergic respiratory reactions (<LINK REF="STD-Sabbah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sabbah 2000</LINK>). This may in turn have a bearing on people with allergic asthma living in large urbanised areas. However, this hypothesis has not been proven in the published literature considered in this review.</P>
<P>There is little objective evidence of the benefit of pet removal on asthma symptoms. It is impossible to determine whether such a strategy may be more effective than using a HEPA filter, or other pet allergen avoidance measures such as washing or chemical sprays.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On the strength of the current body of evidence, HEPA filtration units have not been shown to reduce asthma symptoms significantly in people with pet allergic asthma. This may be due to the small number and size of the studies to date. If a pet is kept in the same residence as a pet allergic asthmatic, there seems to be no evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of allergen avoidance measures in the management of symptoms. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The impact of pet removal on patients with pet allergic asthma should be evaluated, using patient centered outcomes such as quality of life symptom scales, medication reduction in addition to lung function tests. Clinical trials with sample size calculations, rigorous methodology and appropriate patient populations are required to determine what role allergen reduction measures may play in the treatment of asthma. </P>

<P>Note: This comment was based on the previous version of the review which has since been amended as a consequence.</P>
<P>The authors suggest that we should have found a treatment effect in our review of house dust mite control measures for asthma (1). We did not. We reported two significant subgroup results and noted that because of the large number of significance tests we performed, two significant results would be expected to occur by chance.</P>
<P>The authors furthermore refer to a study by Huss et al. (2) which was included in our review and claim that the intervention was found to improve asthma symptoms. This is not correct. As we have reported, there was no significant improvement in asthma symptoms. The study ran for 12 weeks but Huss et al inappropriately did multiple analyses and found a significant difference after 9-10 weeks, but not after 12 weeks (or after 1 week, 3 weeks, 5 weeks or 7 weeks), and reported only the significant result in the abstract. </P>

<P>We thank Gotzsche et al for their useful comments about our review and for drawing attention to some important methodological issues we raise in the Discussion section. The Discussion section of our review refers to the fact that individually some studies are under-powered to detect a significant treatment effect, and that in combination a significant effect can be detected, and not in fact as Gotzsche et al believe, that they should have found a significant treatment effect. Indeed, combining data from studies in a meta-analysis is useful in deriving global assessments of treatment efficacy1. Our review may not have explained that the outcome measure to which we referred from the House-dust mite review was 'asthma symptom scores' and that the subgroup analysis referred to was 'physical interventions' (parallel group trials). We have amended the Discussion to indicate this explicitly. We felt that it would be inappropriate to take the summary statistic for the pooled analysis for this outcome measure as it combined the results not only from different types of interventions (chemical and physical) but this was pooled data from parallel and crossover studies.</P>
<P>We accept the comment regarding the study by Huss et al and the Discussion section has been amended accordingly.</P>

<P>Electronic searches yielded a total of 34 references. Of these, two met the inclusion criteria for the review (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1999</LINK>). One further randomised study did not meet the inclusion criteria, because pet ownership was not stipulated at study entry (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Heide-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van der Heide 1997</LINK> - see Excluded Studies). Upon searching the bibliography of these studies, five further reports were identified and retrieved for possible inclusion in this review. None met the inclusion criteria (see Excluded Studies). The principal reason for exclusion was no randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Villaveces-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Villaveces 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reisman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reisman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boquete-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boquete 1997</LINK>). Two other references identified were a review article (<LINK REF="STD-Sabbah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sabbah 2000</LINK>) and a randomised study which recruited participants sensitive to house dust mites (<LINK REF="STD-Antonicelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Antonicelli 1991</LINK>).</P>
