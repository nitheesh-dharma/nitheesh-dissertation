<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-19 13:33:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of oral betamimetics (drugs that reduce or prevent uterine contraction) to prevent preterm birth of twins.</P>
<P>When babies are born too early they can suffer from ill health, which is sometimes severe and very occasionally babies die. This may be due to their lungs and other organs not being mature enough. The problems related to preterm birth may also result in long-term disabilities including cerebral palsy. Twins are more likely to be born early, have intrauterine growth restriction, and suffer from these problems. Drugs that reduce labour contractions (betamimetics) have been found to delay preterm birth when the mothers are carrying a single baby. However, this review of six trials (374 twin pregnancies) with only five trials (344 twin pregnancies) contributing data, found insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral betamimetics. The results of two small studies suggested that betamimetics can reduce the incidence of preterm labour, but the results from four trials did not show a reduction in preterm births at less than 34 or 37 weeks' gestation. There was no evidence of an effect of betamimetics in reducing the number of low- or small-for-gestational age babies or deaths in newborns. The difference in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome with betamimetics was not clear. Betamimetic drugs can cause maternal adverse effects such as heart palpitations, although this was not reported in the included trials. The quality of evidence is low because there were small numbers of participants and few outcomes in the included trials.</P>
<P>The gestational age at trial entry ranged from 20 weeks to 34 weeks. The types and doses of betamimetics used in the trials varied and the outcomes reported were incomplete and defined in different ways. None of the included trials described whether or not steroids were used before birth to improve the baby&#8217;s lung maturity.</P>

<P>Overall, the quality of evidence is low for the primary outcomes. All of the included trials had small numbers of participants and few events. Preterm birth, the most important primary outcome, had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect.</P>
<P>Six trials (374 twin pregnancies) were included, but only five trials (344 twin pregnancies) contributed data. All trials compared oral betamimetics with placebo.</P>
<P>Betamimetics reduced the incidence of preterm labour (two trials, 194 twin pregnancies, risk ratio (RR) 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.78; <I>low quality evidence</I>). However, betamimetics did not reduce prelabour rupture of membranes (one trial, 144 twin pregnancies, RR 1.42; 95% CI 0.42 to 4.82; <I>low quality evidence</I>), preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (four trials, 276 twin pregnancies, RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10; <I>low quality evidence</I>), or less than 34 weeks' gestation (one trial, 144 twin pregnancies, RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.50; <I>low quality evidence</I>). Mean neonatal birthweight in the betamimetic group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (three trials, 478 neonates, mean difference 111.22 g; 95% CI 22.21 to 200.24). Nevertheless, there was no evidence of an effect of betamimetics in reduction of low birthweight (two trials, 366 neonates, average RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.85, random-effects), or small-for-gestational age neonates (two trials, 178 neonates, average RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.99, random-effects). Two trials showed that betamimetics significantly reduced the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (388 neonates, RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.77), but the difference was not significant when the analysis was adjusted to account for the non-independence of twins (194 twins, RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.11 to 1.16). Three trials showed no evidence of an effect of betamimetics in reducing neonatal mortality, either with the unadjusted analysis, assuming twins are completely independent of each other (452 neonates, average RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.15 to 5.37, random-effects), or in the adjusted analysis, assuming non-independence of twins (226 twins, average RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.23 to 2.38, random-effects). A maternal death was reported in one trial without a significant difference between the groups (144 women, RR 2.84; 95% CI 0.12 to 68.57).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-18 11:50:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-18 11:49:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The incidence of twins and higher order multiple pregnancy is increasing because of various factors including the wide availability of assisted reproductive technologies. In the United States, the rate of twin pregnancies rose from 18.9 per 1000 births in 1980 to 33.1 per 1000 births in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2013</LINK>). Twin pregnancies carry a higher risk of neonatal mortality compared to singleton pregnancies. In 2010 in the United States, infant mortality in twin pregnancies was 24.03 per 1000 livebirths while it was 5.45 per 1000 livebirths in singleton pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Mathews-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathews 2013</LINK>). In addition to increased perinatal mortality, perinatal morbidity is also more likely. The increased risk of neonatal death and long-term morbidity among twin infants is likely attributable to increased preterm birth and low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nearly 60% of twins are born preterm (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2014</LINK>). Twins are 5.7 times more likely to be born at less than 37 weeks of gestation compared with singletons and 7.1 times more likely to be born at less than 32 weeks of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2014</LINK>). Problems related to preterm birth result in significant anxiety for the parents; in addition, these problems are also public health concerns because the premature babies need care with high cost and may have long-term disabilities. Preterm birth is associated with respiratory distress syndrome (a respiratory disorder that is characterised by failure of the immature lungs to expand and contract properly during breathing), intracranial haemorrhage (bleeding within the brain), necrotising enterocolitis (a serious gastrointestinal disease in neonates characterised by mucosal or transmucosal necrosis of part of the intestine), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a chronic lung condition that is caused by tissue damage to the lungs and usually occurs in immature infants who have received mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen), and cerebral palsy (a disability resulting from damage to the brain before, during, or shortly after birth and outwardly manifested by muscular incoordination and speech disturbances). A case-control study based on the Swedish Medical Birth Registry and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry showed that when looking at a group of infants with cerebral palsy and a group of non-cerebral palsy controls, twins were identified significantly more often in the group with cerebral palsy (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.6) (<LINK REF="REF-Thorngren_x002d_Jerneck-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorngren-Jerneck 2006</LINK>). From a European multicentre study, the rate of cerebral palsy in children born in 1975 to 1990 increased from 1.8 per 1000 live births of singleton pregnancy to 7.6 per 1000 live births of twin pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Topp-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topp 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-11-18 11:50:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Reducing the rate of preterm birth in twins is a major goal of obstetricians worldwide. However, interventions to prevent preterm labour in twin pregnancies have been disappointing. Bed rest is the oldest proposed method for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies. A meta-analysis found not enough evidence to support a policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest in multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2010</LINK>). Similarly, prophylactic cerclage has not been shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth in twins (<LINK REF="REF-Rafael-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rafael 2014</LINK>). Home uterine activity monitoring may possibly have a role in predicting preterm birth in very small and specific populations; however, there is insufficient evidence supporting benefit in preventing preterm birth in twin gestations (<LINK REF="REF-Reichmann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichmann 2009</LINK>). Prenatal administration of progesterone has demonstrated an effectiveness on the reduction of preterm birth in singleton pregnancies in women who are high risk for preterm birth (women with a past history of spontaneous preterm birth or short cervix) (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>). However, progesterone treatment could not prevent preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Betamimetics or beta-adrenergic agonists have been used for tocolysis since the 1980s. These drugs include beta-1 agonist (isoxsuprine) and beta-2 agonists (ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline, hexoprenaline, orciprenaline, fenoterol). They cause myometrial relaxation by activating adenyl cyclase to form cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that will decrease myosin light-chain kinase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Simhan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simhan 2007</LINK>). Betamimetics given to women with preterm labour can delay birth by 48 hours to seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>). Additional to intervention for reducing preterm birth, corticosteroids administration to mothers prior to preterm birth was shown to be effective in preventing respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-22 14:20:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-17 17:34:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The effectiveness of betamimetics in preventing preterm labour and preterm birth in twins is still unproven. Furthermore, betamimetics can cause maternal adverse effects from minor symptoms such as palpitations to life-threatening conditions such as pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Sciscione-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciscione 2003</LINK>), and have been associated with maternal death. We conducted this review to evaluate the role of prophylactic oral betamimetics administered to women with a twin pregnancy for the prevention of preterm labour and preterm birth. The primary outcomes are the incidence of preterm labour, preterm birth, neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and adverse maternal effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using GRADE</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE Handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons: </P>
<OL>
<LI>preterm labour;</LI>
<LI>preterm prelabour rupture of membranes;</LI>
<LI>preterm birth - less than 37 weeks' gestation;</LI>
<LI>preterm birth - less than 34 weeks' gestation</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.gradepro.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We used the number of women as the denominator for the incidence of preterm labour and birth and adverse maternal effects. For neonatal and infant outcomes, we used the number of babies as the denominator. To avoid incorrect conclusions due to the non-independence of babies from twin pregnancies, the sensitivity analysis was performed assuming different degrees of correlation between twins. This was done by dividing both numerator and denominator by either the numbers one or two. Dividing by one gave the unadjusted figures, assuming independence between twins, whereas dividing by two gave the most conservative figures, assuming complete correlation.</P>

<P>For included studies, levels of attrition were noted. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses.

We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I² was greater than 30% and either the Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-11-18 11:59:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-19 14:55:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ashworth-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ashworth 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skjaerris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Skjaerris 1982</LINK>) suggested that betamimetics can reduce the rate of preterm labour, but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this intervention could reduce the incidence of prelabour rupture of membranes or preterm birth. The difference in incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in neonates between the groups was not clear because the sensitivity analyses for different degrees of correlation between twins showed contrary results. The criteria used for diagnosis and assessment of severity of respiratory distress syndrome in various studies remains to be verified and the information as to whether there were any undisclosed co-interventions, such as steroid administration, needs to be ascertained. The neonates in the betamimetic group had a higher mean birthweight than in the placebo group, with a mean difference of 111.22 g. The clinical relevance on childhood and later outcomes is uncertain. This finding was statistically significant, but has limited clinical importance as the mean birthweight of neonates in the placebo group was between 2360 and 2670 g. More importantly, there were no demonstrable differences between neonates in the betamimetic and placebo groups in the incidence of low birthweight, small-for-gestational age or neonatal mortality.</P>
<P>Most of the secondary outcomes were not reported in the included trials. These outcomes included admission neonatal intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, intracranial haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, length of hospital stay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, abnormal neurodevelopmental status, and all maternal morbidities (pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrhythmias, glucose intolerance and postpartum haemorrhage).</P>
<P>One maternal death was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ashworth-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ashworth 1990</LINK>). The woman had been taking salbutamol for 12 days before having a precipitous labour at home. Postpartum haemorrhage was reported as the cause of death. The death may be related to the intervention if the haemorrhage was due to uterine atony, but no detail regarding the cause of haemorrhage was described.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-18 12:04:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There were some limitations that should be considered in interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>Firstly, the allocation concealment was not clearly defined in three of the six trials. Of the other three trials with adequate allocation concealment, two trials had some participants, mostly in the betamimetic group, with incomplete outcome measurements.</P>
<P>Secondly, types and doses of betamimetics used in the trials varied. However, the dosage of each betamimetic used in these trials is comparable to dosage used in a singleton pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thirdly, the outcomes reported in the trials were incomplete and variously defined. No trial reported on childhood outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-11-18 12:04:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence is low for the primary outcomes: preterm labour; prelabour rupture of membranes; preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation; very preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. All of the included trials had small numbers of participants and few events, which led to downgrading evidence for imprecision of findings. Preterm birth, the most important primary outcome, had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-11-18 12:04:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We were aware of the possibility of introducing bias at every stage of the reviewing process. In this updated review, we tried to minimise bias in a number of ways. The eligibility for inclusion of the trials was assessed in duplicate, and two review authors carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias; each worked independently. Nevertheless, the process of assessing risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and includes many personal judgements. Further, the process of reviewing research studies is known to be affected by prior beliefs and attitudes. It is difficult to control for this type of bias in the reviewing process.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-12-25 07:33:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is limited evidence regarding the use of oral betamimetics for reducing preterm birth. In a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Whitworth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitworth 2008</LINK>), insufficient evidence was also found to support or refute the use of prophylactic oral betamimetics for preventing preterm birth in women at high risk of preterm labour with a singleton pregnancy.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence either supporting or refuting the use of prophylactic oral betamimetics for preventing preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-07 15:32:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is still no effective intervention to prevent preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy. Appropriate research is necessary for finding interventions that may be useful in these cases. Each of the included trials in this meta-analysis had a small sample size. If a trial is proposed to test the effect of betamimetics with a reduction rate of 50% of preterm birth (less than 34 weeks' gestation) at a 0.05 significance level and a power of 90%, a sample size of 524 twin pregnancies in each group is needed. In addition, the outcome measurements in such a trial should include not only the incidence of preterm birth, but also the incidence of precisely defined immaturity-related neonatal morbidities and include longer-term childhood outcomes.</P>
