<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Family therapy for depression</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review looks at whether family therapy is an effective intervention in treating people of any age with depression. Family therapy for depression is widely used, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. The small number of randomised controlled trials included in the review were very heterogeneous, and therefore difficult to synthesise. Family therapy seems more effective than no treatment or being placed on a waiting list, but it remains unclear how effective this intervention is in comparison to other interventions. Further randomised controlled trials are needed. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with depression often experience interpersonal problems. Family therapy for depression is a widely used intervention, but it is unclear whether this is an effective therapy for the treatment of depression.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of family therapy for depression.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched using a specific search strategy: CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References searched on 21/10/2005, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1980 to January 2005), Psycinfo (1974 to January 2005). Reference lists of articles were also searched. Handsearches of relevant journals and bibliographies were conducted and first authors of included studies and experts in the field were contacted for further information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Included studies were randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials comparing family therapy with no intervention or an alternative intervention in which depression symptomatology was a main outcome measure. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors using the Maastricht-Amsterdam Criteria List. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the selected trials were independently extracted by three review authors using a standardised data extraction form. Levels of evidence were used to determine the strength of the evidence available. It was not possible to perform meta-analyses because of the heterogeneity of the selected studies. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three high-quality and three low-quality studies, involving 519 people with depression, were identified. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments. Despite fairly good methodological quality and positive findings of some studies, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression did not exceed level 3 (limited or conflicting evidence), except for moderate evidence (level 2), based on the non-combined findings from three studies, indicating that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on decreasing depression, and on increasing family functioning. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. Further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>Description of the condition</B>
<BR/>Major depression is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses, both in the United States and in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Bijl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESEMeD-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESEMeD 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESEMeD-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESEMeD 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1994</LINK>). Characteristics of depression include dysphoria, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, impaired concentration and memory difficulties, and feelings of worthlessness, often associated with suicidal ideation. Physical symptoms such as sleep disturbance, weight change, fatigue and anxiety may occur simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Hays-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hays 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>The Global Burden of Disease Study by the World Health Organisation reports that psychiatric illness accounts for over 15% of the burden of disease in established market economies (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). The point prevalence of current major depression and dysthymia in various European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) is 3.9% and 1.1%, respectively. The lifetime prevalence rates for major depression and dysthymia are 12.8% and 4.1%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ESEMeD-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESEMeD 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESEMeD-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESEMeD 2004b</LINK>). These rates show that depression is a public health issue of considerable magnitude. Not only is the individual who is diagnosed with depression faced with distress and impairment in many domains of functioning, depression may also cause major suffering for the families of depressive individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Hays-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hays 1995</LINK>). Aside from the individual consequences of depression, evidence from both the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Kind-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kind 1993</LINK>) as well as in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Berto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berto 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>) indicates direct costs in terms of treatment and indirect costs in terms of lost work days and premature mortality are also high. </P>
<P>
<B>Description of interventions for depression</B>
<BR/>In view of the high prevalence of depression and the significant public health impact associated with this condition, it is important to identify effective and cost-effective treatments for depression. Individuals who receive treatment for their depressive symptoms are currently treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. Although there is evidence of effectiveness for antidepressants, psychotherapy is more popular with patients, and a number of different types of psychological therapies are available, including cognitive behaviour therapy, interpersonal therapy, brief psychotherapy, and counselling. All these therapies have shown to be effective in the treatment of common mental disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Hammen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammen 1997</LINK>). Cognitive behaviour therapy has shown to be most effective in alleviating depressive symptoms when compared with psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy and supportive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2001</LINK>). Nevertheless, in all therapies, about 40 % of the patients who are suffering from depression do not respond to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-AHCPR-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHCPR 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>How the intervention might work</B>
<BR/>In most psychological therapies, the system in which an individual lives is not taken into account. However, there is a small, but convincing, body of empirical evidence for the relationship between the characteristics of the system in which an individual lives and the onset and continuation of depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Gotlib-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotlib 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gotlib-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotlib 2002</LINK>). Individuals suffering from depression often report significant problems in multiple areas of their family functioning, suggesting the need for a more family-oriented approach such as family therapy, or combinations of family therapy with individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Keitner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keitner 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Family therapy may be defined as any psychotherapeutic endeavour that explicitly focuses on altering interactions between or among family members and seeks to improve the functioning of the family as a unit, or its subsystems, and/or the functioning of the individual members of the family (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). The goal of family therapy for depression is working with participants and their family to disengage from destructive forms of communication, and through that process, to reduce the symptoms of depression. Therefore, the primary outcome in trials is not always the reduction of depression in the patient. </P>
<P>There are several family-oriented treatment traditions. Psychoeducational models focus on altering negative attributions about patient illness, teaching coping skills, and providing support to patient and family (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>). Behavioural models are based on learning theory and operant conditioning. They typically focus on the parent or parent-child dyad and seek to improve skills by teaching about behavioural contingencies and reinforcement (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>). Object relations family therapy is a form of psychoanalytic therapy in which marital and family relationships are considered in terms of the projection of internalised infant-parent patterns onto contemporary adult relationships. The therapist takes a position of containment and comments on replication of patterns and working through toward a more complete integrated and realistic perspective (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Systemic models view dysfunctional family relationships as causing or reinforcing symptoms. Consequently, systems therapists attempt to restructure maladaptive patterns of family interaction, such as re-establishing parental hierarchy, detriangulating a child from parental conflicts, and adjusting weak or rigid boundaries (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>). (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). In structural family therapy, problems are viewed to result from inappropriate family structure and organisation. The therapist is concerned with the boundaries between subsystems and takes responsibility for the direction in which she or he pushes the family by the intentional use of commands, directions, and suggestions (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). In post-Milan family therapies, the emphasis is on communication and learning. Problems arise from limitations in alternatives. The therapy focuses on a process of posing questions that would facilitate different connections (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). Solution-focused family therapy suggests that problems are maintained by the way difficulties are viewed and by the repetitive behavioural sequences surrounding attempts to solve them. The task for the therapist is to develop knowledge of the client's strengths and solutions to other problems and then set about the process of applying these to the particular problem at hand (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). In White's narrative therapy, the therapist looks for unique outcomes and positive exceptions to the problematic story, and amplifies change by use of letter writing, specific audiences and personal enthusiasm. The problem recedes to relative insignificance as a more positive account of the individual emerges (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). The depressive individual and his or her family members are involved in family therapy and all attend at least part of the sessions. </P>
<P>
<B>Why it is important to do this review</B>
<BR/>Family therapy is often used in the treatment of conduct disorders, substance misuse, eating disorders and depression. It has become a widely used intervention in child and adolescent mental health services over the last twenty years in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>). Several reviews on family therapy have been conducted previously (<LINK REF="REF-Asarnow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asarnow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curry 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillham 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaslow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaslow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherrill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherrill 2004</LINK>). These reviews show that little research has been conducted on the efficacy of family therapy for the treatment of depression, and that the available evidence for the efficacy of this intervention is heterogeneous. However, to date, no systematic review has been undertaken in this area. In this systematic review, we examined the effectiveness of any type of family therapy for the treatment of depression. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of family therapy in the treatment of depressive symptoms.<BR/>The specific objectives of this review were:<BR/>1) To examine the efficacy of family therapy for depression in comparison with no treatment or waiting list conditions<BR/>2) To examine the efficacy of family therapy for depression in comparison with treatment with antidepressants for depression<BR/>3) To examine the efficacy of family therapy for depression in comparison with other psychotherapies for depression<BR/>4) To examine the efficacy of family therapy for depression in comparison with other forms of treatment in combination with family therapy<BR/>5) To examine the efficacy of categories of family therapy versus one another. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>This review included randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, published or unpublished. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trial participants were both male and female, with no age restrictions. </P>
<P>For the purposes of reducing clinical heterogeneity, it might have been preferable to limit inclusion based on whether studies had used formal diagnostic criteria to recruit their subjects. However, since individuals with depressive symptoms do not always meet formal diagnostic criteria, but can still experience major problems in family functioning that might benefit from family therapy, we chose to include studies involving participants meeting a diagnosis of major depression disorder (according to standardised criteria, such as DSM-III, DSM-IV or ICD-10) as well as studies involving participants experiencing depressive symptoms. </P>
<P>In this review, 'family' was defined as the nuclear family, consisting of one or two parents and children. The family members did not have to be biologically-related, for instance, parents could be foster-parents. At least one family member had to be identified as having depressive symptoms. The identified family member could be any member of the nuclear family. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Different types of family therapy (psychoeducational, behavioural, object relations, solution-focused and systemic models, to include structural and post-Milan approaches) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions had to meet the following criteria:<BR/>1) The family intervention consists of several phases -assessment, psychoeducation, improving functioning in several areas (cognitive, affective, interpersonal and adaptive behaviour) by cognitive, behavioural and/or systemic approaches and feedback, and closure <BR/>2) The intervention must be explicitly delivered by at least one experienced clinician or a trained therapist.<BR/>3) The majority of the sessions within the family treatment should be attended by the participant and (all or part of) the family members or primary caregivers.<BR/>4) The family intervention should consist of a minimum of six sessions, with a length of at least one hour. </P>
<P>Studies were excluded if the family intervention described was a therapy in which multiple families were treated in a group therapy. </P>
<P>For the purposes of comparing different types of family therapy, when sufficient studies were available, interventions were also categorised as follows:<BR/>1) Behavioural (including psychoeducation)<BR/>2) Psychodynamic (including object relations)<BR/>3) Systemic (including structural, post-Milan)</P>
<P>The eligible studies involved comparisons of family therapy with any comparison, whether it was no treatment or a waiting list condition, any structured individual or group psychological treatment (for example, cognitive behaviour therapy, social skills training, interpersonal psychotherapy), antidepressant therapy, or both.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<B>Primary outcome</B>
<BR/>1) The primary outcome measure in this review was depression symptom levels. This is usually measured using a range of rating scales, for example, self rating scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>) and clinician-rated scales, such as the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HRSD) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Secondary Outcomes </B>
<BR/>Other important outcomes assessed if available in included trials: <BR/>2) family functioning<BR/>3) other symptoms (eg hopelessness, suicidal ideation, anxiety)<BR/>4) behaviour and functioning. <BR/>5) other outcomes (eg social support, expectancies of treatment, quality of life)</P>
<P>For overall improvement and improvement of symptoms of depression, both results at the end of treatment and results at follow-up were taken into consideration. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>
<B>Electronic bibliographic databases</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration Depression Anxiety and Neurosis group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) - Studies was searched - 21/10/2005 - using the following terms:<BR/>Diagnosis = Depress* or Dysthymi* or "Adjustment Disorder*" or "Mood Disorder*" or Affective<BR/>and <BR/>Intervention = Family</P>
<P>CCDANCTR-References was searched - 21/10/2005 - using the following terms:<BR/>Keyword = Depress* or Dysthymi* or "Adjustment Disorder*" or "Mood Disorder*" or Affective<BR/>and<BR/>Free-text = Family</P>
<P>To supplement the results from the CCDANCTR and CENTRAL the databases MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards) and PsycINFO (1974) were also searched using the above terms.</P>
<P>
<B>Handsearching</B>
<BR/>Psychiatric journals identified as being likely to contain RCTs of family therapy for depression were handsearched to identify relevant articles with references to randomisation within the text (Family Process 2003-2004, Journal of Family Therapy 1999-2004).</P>
<P>
<B>Bibliographies</B> <BR/>References and bibliographies from the text of reports of relevant trials and reviews were examined for further RCTs not yet identified. Social Sciences and Science Citation Index were searched for all included studies. </P>
<P>
<B>Personal Communication</B>
<BR/>The first author on all included studies and experts in the field were contacted for information regarding published and unpublished trials.<BR/>Professional associations for family therapy were also identified and contacted.</P>
<P>
<B>Grey literature</B>
<BR/>Grey literature such as conference abstracts/proceedings, government documents and other literature outside of the main journal literature were searched where possible, and the electronic database of Information on Scientific and Technical Proceedings was also explored.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Two authors (TH and MH) independently screened the abstracts of studies retrieved by the computer-assisted searches. Abstracts of studies identified by citation-tracking or personal communication were also screened by both TH and MH. The inclusion criteria were used to determine whether studies were eligible, and full articles were then obtained from these studies. Any disagreements between TH and MH about the selection of studies were resolved through discussion between TH and MH, and a third author (JR). Thus, the final selection of studies was established.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction </B>
<BR/>Three review authors ( TH, JR, and KR) independently extracted qualitative and quantitative data from the selected studies using a standardised data extraction sheet. Disagreement between TH and JR, and between TH and KR, was resolved through discussion between the three authors and a fourth review author (MH). </P>
<P>For each study, information was recorded on the study population, interventions, randomisation and blinding procedures, sample size, patient follow-up, statistical analyses, outcome data, follow-up, discussion and conclusions (this was a summary of recorded information).</P>
<P>
<B>Obtaining unpublished data for the included trials</B>
<BR/>Attempts were made to obtain data which were not included in published reports. The first author of each study was contacted through dissemination of a standard letter explaining the purposes of the review and the reasons for requesting the additional unreported data. If no usable information was forthcoming, the study would nevertheless contribute to the meta-analysis. </P>
<P>
<B>Methodological assessment of the quality of included trials </B>
<BR/>Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted relating to the internal validity (the extent to which trials measured what they purported to measure), study power (to establish the likelihood of random errors), and external validity (the extent to which the results are generalisable or applicable to clinical practice). This was done independently by TH and MH using the Maastricht-Amsterdam Criteria List (MACL) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>). JR was involved in rating methodological quality if disagreement occurred between TH and MH. Accordingly, review authors were allowed to adjust their score assignments. If additional information on study characteristics was provided by authors on request, this information was used in the scoring of the MACL items. If studies met all inclusion criteria, they were not excluded solely on the basis of their methodological quality. </P>
<P>The MACL was originally developed in the field of muscular-skeletal disorders, but is considered to produce disease non-specific quality ratings. The MACL also incorporates all criteria of other prominent quality scales, such as the Jadad List (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) and the Delphi List (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>). The MACL contains 17 items to assess internal validity (e.g. selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias, ten items), external validity (descriptive criteria, 5 items) and statistical aspects (2 items) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for list of items). The total score on the MACL ranges from 0 to 17. To prevent different interpretations of study characteristics between review authors, each item of the MACL was explained in a separate appendix that provided uniform operationalisations of the criteria. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data synthesis<BR/>
</B>The selected studies were very heterogeneous in types of interventions, types of complaints, study population and outcomes measures, and therefore meta-analyses were not performed. Findings were reported narratively. Review Manager software was used to summarise the findings.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<B>
<I>Levels of evidence</I>
</B>
<BR/>For a more qualitative approach to synthesise the findings from included studies, so-called 'levels of evidence' were used (<LINK REF="REF-Ostelo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostelo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2001</LINK>). This method of rating evidence enables authors of systematic reviews to summarise the strength of scientific evidence. We classified results of studies with comparable interventions and sufficiently comparable outcome measures according to one of four levels:</P>
<P>1. Good evidence - provided by generally consistent findings in two or more high-quality studies<BR/>2. Moderate evidence - provided by generally consistent findings in one high-quality study and one or more low-quality studies, or by generally consistent findings in two or more low-quality studies<BR/>3. Limited or conflicting evidence - only one study (either high or low quality), or inconsistent findings in two or more studies<BR/>4. No evidence - no studies.</P>
<P>Each item of the MACL was scored as 'positive'(+), 'negative' (-) or 'unclear' (?). A positive score on items 2 to 10 was accredited one point, while a negative or unclear point was accredited no points. Item 1 consisted of 1a and 1b: positive scores on these items were accredited 0.5 points each. </P>
<P>High quality studies were defined as studies that fulfilled 5 or more of the 10 MACL internal validity items (range 0-10). Low quality was defined as scoring less than 5 points on the 10 MACL internal validity items. </P>
<P>Generally consistent findings were defined as 75% or more of the studies having statistically significant findings in the same direction. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Methods for future updates</I>
</B>
<BR/>In future updates of this review, meta-analyses will be performed where more than two studies report data on a particular outcome for a clinically comparable intervention with a similar follow-up period. Analyses will be performed using the following methodology: </P>
<P>
<I>Measures of treatment effect</I>
<BR/>For binary outcomes, relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. For continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated where the same instrument has been used across studies, and the standardised mean difference (SMD) will be used where different scales have been used to measure the same outcome. </P>
<P>In the first instance, the fixed-effect model will be used. The random-effects model will be used to test the robustness of the findings. The random-effects model will be used where statistical heterogeneity is observed. </P>
<P>
<I>Assessment of heterogeneity<BR/>
</I>Formal assessment of heterogeneity will be conducted using the chi-squared test and I<SUP>2</SUP> test. A chi-squared value of less than 0.10 and an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of greater than 50% will be interpreted as significant heterogeneity. </P>
<P>
<I>Dealing with missing data<BR/>
</I>For binary outcomes, intention to treat (ITT) analysis will be used, in which it is assumed that all dropouts had negative outcomes. For continuous outcomes, available case analysis will be used. Missing statistics, such as standard deviations, will be obtained from trial authors where possible, or calculated from available data.</P>
<P>
<I>Subgroup analyses and investigation of heterogeneity</I>
<BR/>The following subgroup analyses will be performed: <BR/>Severity of depression<BR/>Clinical setting <BR/>Child/adolescents vs adults diagnosed with depression</P>
<P>Where statistical heterogeneity is present, subgroup analyses will be conducted to examine clinical heterogeneity </P>
<P>
<I>Sensitivity analyses</I>
<BR/>Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Where statistical heterogeneity is observed, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to examine methodological heterogeneity, through excluding lower quality studies from analyses. </P>
<P>
<I>Publication bias</I>
<BR/>Data from all selected trials will be entered into a funnel plot to investigate publication bias.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>The computer-assisted searches of databases yielded 13 studies in CCDANTR-studies and 85 references in CCDANTR-references. Of these, 29 full-text articles were retrieved, based on title and abstract, and were screened for eligibility. A further 14 articles were identified through citation tracking or personal communication, and were retrieved for further screening. Of these 43 full-text articles, 30 were selected for additional reading. </P>
<P>Seven authors were contacted for additional information or unpublished data, and five authors responded to our requests. This process resulted in six studies (21 articles) that met eligibility criteria and were included in the review (see 'Characteristics of included studies' table). Fourteen studies (19 articles) were excluded from the review (see 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table). The results from one study have not been published yet, and will be assessed at a later date (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Excluded studies</B>
<BR/>Fourteen studies did not meet our inclusion criteria (see 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table). Four studies were aimed at prevention of depression and therefore depression was not an important outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Beardslee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Beardslee 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cicchetti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cicchetti 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2003</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1986</LINK>, the intervention was only one 4-hour session, instead of the minimum of six one-hour sessions. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Asarnow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Asarnow 2002</LINK>, the intervention was not aimed at the entire system. The intervention used by <LINK REF="STD-Brodaty-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Brodaty 1983</LINK> did not appear to be family therapy. In two studies, the outcome measures did not include depression symptom levels (<LINK REF="STD-Eisdorfer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eisdorfer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1996</LINK>). In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1975</LINK>, the intervention was marital therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Fristad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fristad 2002</LINK> used a multi-family therapy intervention. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Podorefsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Podorefsky 2001</LINK> was not a randomised controlled or a controlled clinical trial. <LINK REF="STD-Sherrill-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sherrill 1997</LINK> used a single-session workshop as the intervention, while in <LINK REF="STD-Uebelacker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelacker 2004</LINK>, the outcome measures of different treatment arms were unknown. </P>
<P>
<B>Included studies</B>
<BR/>Six studies met the inclusion criteria, the most important characteristics and outcomes of which were summarised in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. The studies were published in eight journals (Archives of General Psychiatry, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Journal of Consulting &amp; Clinical Psychology, Hospital and Community Psychiatry, American Journal of Psychiatry, Journal of Affective Disorders, Behaviour Therapy, and the American Journal of Community Psychology), and were written in English.</P>

<B>
<I>Characteristics of individual studies</I>
</B>
<BR/>In an RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>, 107 adolescent participants with DSM-III-R major depressive disorder and their parents were randomised to receive individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), or systemic behaviour family therapy (SBFT) (<LINK REF="REF-Brent-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 1996</LINK>), with an attempt to control for therapist exposure by offering individual nondirective supportive therapy (NST) as a control condition. The treatment period covered 12 to 16 weeks, with a boosterphase of two to four sessions in as many months. Participants received an average of 11 sessions. Outcomes were measured at intake, at the sixth session, at the end of treatment, at one year follow-up, and 24 months after treatment ended. In this study, predetermined criteria were set for a successful outcome which was of clinical relevance. </P>
<P>In an RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>, 32 adolescent participants with DSM-II-R major depressive disorder and their primary caretakers were randomised to receive attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1995</LINK>), or a waiting list control condition. The duration of the treatment period is 12 weeks. Participants received an average of 8 sessions. Outcomes were measured at intake, mid-treatment (after six weeks), post-treatment (after 12 weeks), and six months' post-treatment. Outcome measures included measures for family functioning, and anxiety for children. </P>
<P>In an RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>, 169 adult inpatients with schizophrenic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, major affective disorder, and a subgroup meeting other DSM-III axis I diagnoses and their families were randomised. 50 participants in this trial were subgrouped in the group for affective disorders, of whom 29 met criteria for a unipolar depression. These participants received a psychoeducational inpatient family intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1988</LINK>) or a comparison treatment, in which the participants were offered treatment as usual, which was among other things individual psychotherapy. Treatment duration was eight weeks. Participants received an average of nine sessions. Outcomes were measured at admission, at discharge, at six months follow-up, and at 18 months follow-up. Outcome measures included family attitude, and role performance. </P>
<P>In an RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>, 92 adult participants who met criteria for current bipolar I disorder (of which 18 patients met criteria for unipolar depression: data for this subgroup was reported separately) and their family members were randomised to receive family therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1990</LINK>) and pharmacotherapy, psychoeducational group therapy and pharmacotherapy, or pharmacotherapy alone. The length of the RCT is 10 weeks. Participants received six to 10 sessions of family therapy. Outcomes were measured at intake and monthly thereafter. The period of follow-up measurements was 28 months. Predetermined criteria for a successful outcome which was of clinical relevance were set. </P>
<P>In an RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>, 47 families with mothers with DSM-IV major depressive disorder, who had children aged between 3 and 9 years old, meeting DSM-IV criteria for either conduct disorder or oppositional-defiant disorder were randomised to receive behavioural family intervention (BFI) (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1993</LINK>), or cognitive behavioural family intervention (CBFI) (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1993</LINK>). The period of intervention was 12 weeks. Participants received 12 sessions. Outcomes were measured at baseline, post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up. Outcome measures included cognitive scales, measurements on child behaviour, and perceived social support.</P>
<P>In an RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>, 72 surviving spouses of individuals aged 25-50 who had died within the prior two years, with at east one child aged 7-17 years were randomised to receive a family bereavement program (<LINK REF="REF-Sandler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>), or a waiting list control condition. Depressive symptoms were measured in the participating children. The length of the RCT was 15 weeks. Participants received three sessions of grief workshop and 12 sessions in the adviser program. Outcomes were measured at intake, and post-treatment. There were no follow-up measurements. Several measures of family characteristics were included, such as family coping, discussion of grief-related issues, and family cohesion. </P>

<B>
<I>Overall characteristics of included studies</I>
</B>
<BR/>Five of the included studies were conducted in the United States and one in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). In four of the studies, outpatients were included (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>), and in two studies inpatients were included (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>). Two studies focused on adolescent participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>), one on children (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>), and three on adult participants (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). The number of participants included varied from 32 (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>) to 169 (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>The length of included studies varied from eight (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>) to 15 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>). Participants received eight (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>) to 15 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>) of family intervention. All included studies measured outcomes at intake, three studies measured outcomes during the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>), and five studies measured outcomes post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>). The range of follow-up measurements was no follow-up measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>) to follow-up at 28 months (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>). The types of family therapy offered to the participants in the trials were different in all included studies. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) were of high methodological quality (five points or more out of ten items on internal validity) and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>) had a low methodological quality (less than five points out of ten items on internal validity). Scores on individual items of the MACL for the trials are presented in an additional table 'Quality assessment: internal validity items (MACL) and scores on MACL' (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is not possible to blind participants or care providers in studies of this nature. In one study there was no concealment of treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>), and in all the others it was unclear whether or not concealment of treatment allocation was used. </P>
<P>In three studies, information on the avoidance or comparability of co-interventions was poor (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>), and in the other three studies co-interventions were avoided or comparable (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Acceptable compliance of participants, which is an indication of the acceptability of the treatment to participants, was achieved in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>), while withdrawal rates were acceptable in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). The latter is of particular concern since unacceptable withdrawal/dropout rates, especially due to selective withdrawal, represent a major threat to the validity of the results. </P>
<P>In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>), adverse events were not described. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>, it was unclear if adverse events were described.</P>
<P>In general, it should be noted that all studies reported well on the supervision and training of therapists during the trial. In only two studies, it was clear that therapists had worked with treatment manuals (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). The same two studies performed integrity checks. In all studies, it remained unclear if therapists were licensed or registered family therapists. </P>
<P>The nature of usual care (the exact care participants received) was clearly described in all studies. Four studies reported subgroup analyses or prognostic analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>). In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>), subgroups were similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>, subgroups were not similar at baseline. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>, it was unclear if subgroups were similar at baseline.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The six included studies investigated different interventions, different participants, and different outcomes. For this reason, findings from the studies were reported individually, and no attempt was made to integrate the data in meta-analyses. An overview of the results of included studies is presented in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. The findings of these studies for the main outcomes of interest are described below. Since the six studies used a diverse range of outcomes and outcome measures, outcome data from each individual study are not reported. </P>
<P>For the purposes of the current version of the review, the findings are organised by type of outcome measure. When additional studies with combinable data are included in updated versions of the review, the results will be organised by treatment comparison. </P>
<P>
<B>1. Depression symptom levels</B>
<BR/>The principal outcome measure used by the six studies in this review was depression symptom levels. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Attachment-based family therapy versus waitlist condition</I>
</B>
<BR/>In a low-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>, over 80% of adolescents treated with ABFT no longer met criteria for major depression at post-treatment, against nearly 50% of adolescents in the waiting list condition. At 6-month follow-up, 15 out of the 24 participants (from a sample of the subgroup that had received treatment, combined with the subgroup that at first was put in a waiting list condition, but later had also received treatment) treated with ABFT were assessed, of whom 13 (87%) did not meet criteria for major depression. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Family bereavement program versus waitlist condition</I>
</B>
<BR/>In a low-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>, there were significant improvements for older children who received the family bereavement program on depression. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Psychoeducational inpatient family intervention versus treatment as usual </I>
</B>
<BR/>In a high-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>, female participants who received an inpatient family intervention compared with those in the comparison group (who received standard hospital treatment; a full range of diagnostic services and drugs plus individual, group and milieu therapies), were doing significantly better at time of discharge from hospital on measures of depression symptomatology. Males were little affected by treatment assignment. At both 6 and 18 months, bipolar patients who received an inpatient family intervention showed a better outcome (female patients only), in contrast with unipolar patients, where those who did not receive the intervention showed a better outcome (both sexes). The positive effect of inpatient family intervention on females in the overall group of affective disorders at discharge was attenuated over time; a negative effect on males became evident at 18 months. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Individual cognitive behaviour therapy versus systemic behaviour family therapy</I>
</B>
<BR/>In a high-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>, individual cognitive behaviour therapy was superior to systemic behaviour family therapy at post-treatment self-reported depressive symptoms, and remission rate. At one year and two year follow-up, no significant differences were seen in rates of major depression between groups. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Cognitive behavioural family intervention versus behavioural family intervention </I>
</B>
<BR/>In a high-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>, mothers in both the cognitive behavioural family intervention group (CBFI) and the behavioural family intervention group (BFI) reported significantly less depression at post-intervention. When comparing pre-intervention to 6-month follow-up, mothers in both conditions showed less depression at follow-up. At follow-up, more mothers in the CBFI condition had depression within the functional range than mothers in the BFI condition. At 6 months follow-up, more families in the CBFI group experienced a concurrent clinically reliable reduction in maternal depression. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Family therapy and pharmacotherapy versus multifamily group therapy and pharmacotherapy versus pharmacotherapy</I>
</B>
<BR/>The results of a low-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK> suggest that neither adjunctive family therapy nor adjunctive multifamily group therapy significantly improved recovery from bipolar I mood episodes, compared to pharmacotherapy alone. However, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK> stated that the sample size for participants with major depression at intake (n = 18) was not large enough to determine whether there was a significantly different response to the randomly assigned treatments for this group. <BR/> <BR/>
<B>
<I>Levels of evidence for depression symptom levels</I>
</B>
<BR/>There is moderate evidence (level 2) that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on depression (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that inpatient family intervention is less effective than treatment as usual for patients with unipolar depression (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that family therapy is less effective than individual cognitive behaviour therapy for depression (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that cognitive behaviour family therapy is equally effective as behaviour family therapy in treating depression (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). There is limited (level 3) evidence that family therapy and pharmacotherapy are equally effective as multifamily group therapy and pharmacotherapy, and pharmacotherapy alone for depression (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>2. Family functioning</B>
<BR/>Five of the six trials included in the review measured the effects of the interventions on family functioning.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Attachment-based family therapy versus waitlist condition</I>
</B>
<BR/>In a low-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>, participants receiving ABFT reported significantly less family conflict post-treatment than participants in the waiting list group. Furthermore, adolescents treated with ABFT reported significantly higher levels of attachment to their mothers.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Family bereavement program versus waitlist condition</I>
</B>
<BR/>The family bereavement program in a low-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK> increased parental reports of the warmth of their relationship with their children relative to the control group. Parents in the control group reported a greater decrease in discussion of grief-related issues in time than did parents in the treatment group. Significant decreases in the occurrence of negative events were reported for younger children in the control group, and marginal decreases of negative events were reported for older children in the treatment program.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Psychoeducational inpatient family intervention versus treatment as usual </I>
</B>
<BR/>The results from a high-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK> showed that family attitude toward treatment was significantly better in inpatient family intervention females than in comparison females, whereas family attitude toward the participant was significantly better in males who received the comparison treatment than in males who received inpatient family intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Individual cognitive behaviour therapy versus systemic behaviour family therapy</I>
</B>
<BR/>In a high-quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>, results suggested that systemic behaviour family therapy decreased family conflict and parent-child relationship problems more than individual cognitive behaviour therapy did.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Cognitive behavioural family intervention versus behavioural family intervention </I>
</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK> found that mothers in both the CBFI and BFI condition reported greater competence, and less child problem behaviour at post than pre-intervention. Fathers reported more parenting competence at post-intervention. Children in both conditions showed significantly less negative behaviour at follow-up than at pre-intervention. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Levels of evidence for family functioning</I>
</B>
<BR/>There is moderate (level 2) evidence that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on increasing family functioning measures, such as family conflict, attachment to mother (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2002</LINK>) and warmth of parents' relationships with their children (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1992</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that family therapy is more effective than treatment as usual in improving family attitude toward treatment in female patients (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that family therapy is less effective than treatment as usual in improving family attitude toward the patient in male patients (<LINK REF="STD-Glick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Glick 1985</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that family therapy is more effective than individual cognitive behaviour therapy in decreasing family conflict, and parent-child relationship problems (<LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK>). There is limited evidence (level 3) that cognitive behaviour family therapy is equally effective as behaviour family therapy in improving family functioning (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>Summary of main findings</B>
<BR/>The main objective was to provide a systematic review of the available evidence on the effects of family therapy for depression. Six studies were selected on a priori determined criteria. These studies were largely non-combinable from several aspects, including intervention (participants were treated from very different approaches such as cognitive, behavioural, systemic, psychoeducational or other more unfamiliar theories of family therapy intervention), participants (adults, adolescents and children), and the disorder (measurement instruments). Therefore, results could not be pooled or classified into a single 'level of evidence'. Consequently, an overall conclusion concerning the effectiveness of family therapy for depression could not be drawn. </P>
<P>Despite the existence of some good quality studies and some positive findings, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression does not exceed level 3 (limited or conflicting evidence), except for moderate evidence (level 2) that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition in reducing depression levels and in increasing family functioning. It should be noted that good evidence (two or more high quality trials with consistent findings) could not be established.</P>
<P>Of all studies conducted on family therapy, only a small number met our inclusion criteria, and the trials that were included were mutually divergent. The inclusion criteria were stringent in terms of criteria related to methodology and reducing the risk of bias, but this is essential to obtain an unbiased evaluation of any treatment. Although well-defined, stringent inclusion criteria in systematic reviews increase the validity of any conclusions that can be drawn, they can, as in this review, limit the scope of findings. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>Three of the six included studies were of high methodological quality. The other three studies were of low methodological quality. Often, the low methodological quality was due to incomplete description of the design of the study, but also to randomisation methods, to randomised subgroups that were not similar at baseline, and high attrition rates. </P>
<P>Some deficiencies in published data were identified. <LINK REF="STD-Uebelacker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelacker 2004</LINK> reports results for the same trial described in the article by <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Uebelacker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelacker 2004</LINK>, the same number of participants (n = 92) as described in Miller's article met criteria for unipolar depression, while in the article by Miller, these participants all met criteria for bipolar I disorder. Further clarification on this apparent inconsistency between articles is still awaited.</P>
<P>
<B>Previous reviews </B>
<BR/>Several earlier reviews on the effectiveness of family therapy for depression have been published, none of which were systematic or assessed the methodological quality of included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Asarnow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asarnow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curry 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillham 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaslow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaslow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherrill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherrill 2004</LINK>). Most of these reviews describe the effects of family therapy for depressed children and adolescents. Few reviews have included studies with depressed adults. Furthermore, in earlier reviews, small numbers of studies were discussed. The interventions which have been compared in existing studies are diverse in focus, design, length, and procedure. </P>
<P>Given the fact that there is some evidence for the relationship between the characteristics of the system in which an individual lives and the onset and continuation of depressive disorders, and for reciprocal relationships between depression, parenting behaviour, and parenting stress, it seems intuitively obvious that family therapy might be effective. However, as found in this systematic review, almost all previous reviews on the effects of family therapy for depression have concluded that there is too little evidence to draw any conclusions on the effectiveness of this intervention, and more thorough research is needed to determine the effectiveness of family therapy in comparison to other treatments for depression. </P>
<P>Some reviews have suggested that in case of juvenile depression, the participation of parents in the treatment might be essential (<LINK REF="REF-Cottrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottrell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherrill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherrill 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brent-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brent 1997</LINK> found that parent-child conflict predicted depression relapse of adolescents. They also found that systemic behaviour family therapy decreased family conflict. These are interesting findings, which could be used in future research on family therapy for depression. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Strengths and weaknesses of this review</B>
<BR/>In this review, we have attempted to provide an overall picture of the evidence on family therapy for depression in a systematic way. Other reviews on family therapy have not used this approach of the available evidence, and this is the first systematic review on the subject of family therapy for depression. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by the review authors to increase the internal validity of this review. </P>
<P>In addition, we have linked the assessment of the methodological quality of the included studies to the results by means of the use of levels of evidence. The methodological quality of studies is often assessed in reviews, but in general it is analysed separately from the results which may cause researchers to draw strong conclusions from low-quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moja-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moja 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, we were not able to perform a quantitative meta-analysis in this review, as the six studies each conducted different comparisons. If the results from more high-quality studies become available, our estimates of the effectiveness of family therapy for depression may be made more precise through the quantitative synthesis of trial data. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Family therapy seems superior to a waiting list condition or no treatment. However, when the effectiveness of family therapy is compared to the effectiveness of group interventions, individual cognitive or behavioural interventions, it remains unclear whether family therapy is an effective intervention. There is no evidence on the potentially adverse consequences of this sort of intervention.</P>
<P>It should be noted that family therapy is already a widely used intervention for the treatment of depression, in spite of the lack of high-quality evidence in this field. Whilst acknowledging that clinical practice and the results of research do not always correspond, common sense tells us that a family intervention for depression should only be offered to patients on a systematic basis when there is enough high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of the intervention. At this point, therefore, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In order to assess the effectiveness of family therapy for depression, more high-quality trials need to be conducted. To date, the efficacy literature is hampered by small sample sizes, variations in methodological quality and non-comparability between the different forms of family therapy, so that general conclusions concerning the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of this intervention can not be made. Based on the findings in this review, several recommendations for future research can be made:</P>
<P>Firstly, it is imperative to explicitly test differing models of family therapy. Family therapy is loosely defined in the literature. This leads to a heterogeneous set of treatments that are all conducted under the umbrella of family therapy. </P>
<P>Secondly, the effectiveness of family therapy should be compared against other evidence-based therapies for depression, such as medication, interpersonal therapy, and cognitive behavioural treatments. It may also be worthwhile examining family therapy as an adjunctive treatment to other psychological interventions. </P>
<P>Thirdly, with increased emphasis in the literature on the design and conduct of high quality treatment trials, there are methodological aspects that appear particularly relevant, including: the requirement for trials to use treatment allocation procedures of high quality; the need for satisfactory blinding of outcome assessment; and the need for follow-up duration to reflect the possibility that family therapy has incremental benefits after the end of formal treatment, a suitable minimum follow-up duration being twelve months after treatment end (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>). Trials should be designed with the assistance of a health economist, in order to facilitate the gathering of data relevant to the assessment of cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Fals_x002d_Stewart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fals-Stewart 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, future RCTs should ideally contain study samples large enough to include several subgroups of patients. The reporting of trials should also accord with agreed high quality criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), including a clear description of the design and methods.</P>
<P>Fourthly, therapists in research studies should use manuals to guarantee the highest possible quality and delivery of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>). In this way, family therapy for depression can be standardised, and the variety of therapies that are denominated family therapy can be classified. Furthermore, active components of family therapy interventions can be identified, and built upon in further research and practice. In future research, the use of licensed family therapists seems important to assure and improve the quality of the treatments. </P>
<P>Finally, future research studies should focus on the acceptability of family therapy for patients.</P>
