<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-31 10:34:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the efficacy and safety of intravaginal oestrogenic preparations compared with each other or placebo (inactive or sham treatment) in women undergoing treatment for the symptoms of vaginal atrophy.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Vaginal atrophy is a common condition in women after menopause. It causes vaginal dryness and itching and can make intercourse painful. The female hormone oestrogen is a treatment option for vaginal atrophy, but can cause adverse effects such as increased thickness in the lining of the womb (endometrium) which could be due to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer (resulting in vaginal bleeding) and breast tenderness. Oestrogen is available as an oral tablet, skin patch or implant under the skin. Alternatively, women can apply the hormone locally using creams, pessaries (tablets placed in the vagina) or a hormone-releasing ring placed in the vagina. There is, therefore, the need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these locally-administered oestrogenic preparations.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 30 randomised controlled trials comparing intravaginal oestrogenic preparations with one another or with placebo in a total of 6235 postmenopausal women undergoing treatment for the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. The evidence is current to April 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement in symptoms of vaginal atrophy between the following treatment comparisons: oestrogen ring and oestrogen cream, oestrogen ring and oestrogen tablets, oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream, oestrogen cream and isoflavone gel. However, a higher proportion of women reported improvement in symptoms in the following active treatments compared with placebo: oestrogen ring versus placebo, oestrogen tablets versus placebo and oestrogen cream versus placebo. In the case of oestrogen tablets versus placebo and using a random-effect model for analysis of the data because of substantial heterogeneity, there was no longer evidence of a difference in effect on improvement in symptoms.</P>
<P>With respect to safety, a higher proportion of women who received oestrogen cream showed evidence of increase in endometrial thickness compared to those who were treated with oestrogen ring, which may have been due to the higher doses of cream used. However, there was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with increase in thickness of the lining of the womb between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was of low quality for both improvement in symptoms as reported by women and increase in endometrial thickness. The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, and lack of precision (i.e. effect estimates with wide confidence intervals) in the findings for both outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-08 12:11:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Vaginal atrophy is a frequent complaint of postmenopausal women; symptoms include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort and painful intercourse. Systemic treatment for these symptoms in the form of oral hormone replacement therapy is not always necessary. An alternative choice is oestrogenic preparations administered vaginally (in the form of creams, pessaries, tablets and the oestradiol-releasing ring). This is an update of a Chochrane systematic review; the original version was first published in October 2006.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-01 15:55:44 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched the following databases and trials registers to April 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Register of trials, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016 issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, DARE, the Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-06-15 11:49:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oestrogenic preparations administered intravaginally in postmenopausal women for at least 12 weeks for the treatment of symptoms resulting from vaginal atrophy or vaginitis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-31 10:36:16 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were improvement in symptoms (participant-assessed), and the adverse event endometrial thickness. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptoms (clinician-assessed), other adverse events (breast disorders e.g. breast pain, enlargement or engorgement, total adverse events, excluding breast disorders) and adherence to treatment. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) (dichotomous outcomes) and mean differences (MDs) (continuous outcomes) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-30 21:17:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 30 RCTs (6235 women) comparing different intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations with each other and with placebo. The evidence was low to moderate quality; limitations were poor reporting of study methods and serious imprecision (effect estimates with wide confidence intervals)</P>
<P>1<B>. Oestrogen ring versus other regimens</B>
</P>
<P>Other regimens included oestrogen cream, oestrogen tablets and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in improvement in symptoms (participant assessment) either between oestrogen ring and oestrogen cream (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.19, two RCTs, n = 341, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence) or between oestrogen ring and oestrogen tablets (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15, three RCTs, n = 567, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence). However, a higher proportion of women reported improvement in symptoms following treatment with oestrogen ring compared with placebo (OR 12.67, 95% CI 3.23 to 49.66, one RCT, n = 67). With respect to endometrial thickness, a higher proportion of women who received oestrogen cream showed evidence of increase in endometrial thickness compared to those who were treated with oestrogen ring (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.94, two RCTs, n = 273; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence). This may have been due to the higher doses of cream used.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Oestrogen tablets versus other regimens</B>
</P>
<P>Other regimens in this comparison included oestrogen cream, and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement in symptoms between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.01, two RCTs, n = 208, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% low-quality evidence). A higher proportion of women who were treated with oestrogen tablets reported improvement in symptoms compared to those who received placebo using a fixed-effect model (OR 12.47, 95% CI 9.81 to 15.84, two RCTs, n = 1638, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%, low-quality evidence); however, using a random-effect model did not demonstrate any evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement between the two treatment groups (OR 5.80, 95% CI 0.88 to 38.29). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with increase in endometrial thickness between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.60, two RCTs, n = 151, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>3. <B>Oestrogen cream versus other regimens</B>
</P>
<P>Other regimens identified in this comparison included isoflavone gel and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with improvement in symptoms between oestrogen cream and isoflavone gel (OR 2.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 53.76, one RCT, n = 50, low-quality evidence). However, there was evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with improvement in symptoms between oestrogen cream and placebo with more women who received oestrogen cream reporting improvement in symptoms compared to those who were treated with placebo (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.88 to 8.93, two RCTs, n = 198, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 50%, low-quality evidence). None of the included studies in this comparison reported data on endometrial thickness.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-27 04:14:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between the various intravaginal oestrogenic preparations when compared with each other. However, there was low-quality evidence that intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations improve the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women when compared to placebo. There was low-quality evidence that oestrogen cream may be associated with an increase in endometrial thickness compared to oestrogen ring; this may have been due to the higher doses of cream used. However there was no evidence of a difference in the overall body of evidence in adverse events between the various oestrogenic preparations compared with each other or with placebo.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-31 10:34:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-05 17:22:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-05 17:22:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The ovaries produce a large proportion of circulating oestrogen in women of reproductive age. Before menopause the vagina is made up of thick layers of healthy cells. Oestrogen encourages growth and development of these cells so the vaginal epithelium remains thick and moist and the vagina supple and elastic. However, a dramatic reduction in circulating oestrogen occurs following the loss of ovarian function at the menopause. This oestrogen deficiency induces metabolic and trophic changes. Initially, these may include hot flushes and sweating, mood and sleep disturbances and fatigue. Skin begins to loose its elasticity and bone its strength. Changes occur in the vagina and other genital tissues. These tissues become thinner, drier and less elastic. Low oestrogen levels result in genital areas becoming dry, itchy and more easily irritated. A decrease in blood flow leads to fewer secretions and more dryness and intercourse can become uncomfortable or painful.</P>
<P>Falling oestrogen levels also cause changes in the lower urinary tract: for example the urinary bladder and urethra may display symptoms of urge incontinence, urgency, and frequency. A deterioration in vaginal and urethral tissues is called genitourinary syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2016</LINK>) with a low oestrogen level being the primary cause.</P>
<P>Assessment of vaginal pH is a method for establishing vaginal atrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1992</LINK>). At menopause decreased oestrogen levels cause the vaginal pH to rise to between 6.0 and 7.5 (<LINK REF="REF-Caillouette-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caillouette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crandall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crandall 2002</LINK>). A low premenopausal vaginal pH of 3.5 to 4.5 helps to prevent colonisation with uropathogens. Colonisation can lead to vaginal infection. Therefore, restoration of vaginal pH reflects a clinically important achievement in maintaining the body's natural protection against vaginal infection (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksson 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that about 50% of otherwise healthy women over 60 years of age have symptoms related to vaginal atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Iosif-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iosif 1984</LINK>). In about 45% of menopausal women vaginal atrophy can be clinically manifest as a syndrome of vaginal dryness, itching, irritation and dyspareunia (painful intercourse) (<LINK REF="STD-Bygdeman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bygdeman 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-31 05:14:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oestrogen-based hormone therapy (HT) is effective in treating symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1977</LINK>). However, only a small percentage (10%) of those who would benefit from oestrogen therapy actually receive it (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1988</LINK>), since women are often reluctant to volunteer that they have significant vaginal symptoms because of embarrassment (<LINK REF="REF-Notelovitz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Notelovitz 1997</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-SOGC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOGC 2005</LINK>). Several forms of HT are available, systemic dosage forms include oral, transdermal preparations, nasal sprays, and injectable (not commonly used), as well as local dosage forms using the vaginal route. Local dosage can be administered in the form of the oestradiol-releasing vaginal ring, oestrogen-based vaginal creams, pessaries containing oestriol and a slow-release 17&#946;-oestradiol tablet. The harmful effects of HT have resulted in considerable caution in the manner it is currently used (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 2016</LINK>). Current guidelines advise local oestrogen administration over systemic HT if vaginal atrophy is the only indication for treatment ( <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAMS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAMS 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-01 15:39:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Locally administered oestrogenic preparations work directly on the oestrogen-sensitive tissues of the lower genito-urinary tract, relieving the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Local treatment does not induce altered liver metabolism and this makes it possible to use lower doses of oestrogen compared with oral therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Heimer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heimer 1984</LINK>). This mechanism of action of local oestrogen results in reduction of systemic adverse effects associated with systemic oestrogen such as bleeding, breast tenderness, and endometrial stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Gerbaldo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerbaldo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kivovic-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kivovic 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mettler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mettler 1991</LINK>). Although local treatment appears to have fewer adverse effects many women consider creams and pessaries to be messy and application times difficult to remember. An alternative treatment is a silicone ring with an oestradiol-loaded core which can be inserted and left within the vagina to provide a relatively low and constant release of hormone.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-05 17:17:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>This review evaluated the efficacy and safety of intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations for the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women to inform patient-centred decision making. Different local oestrogenic preparations are currently available for the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. However, uncertainty still exists as to the efficacy and safety of these various preparations. It has, therefore become imperative to critically appraise the existing empirical evidence related to the efficacy and safety of the various local oestrogenic therapies relative to each other. </P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Suckling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suckling 2003</LINK>), and previously updated in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Suckling-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suckling 2006</LINK>). In the 2006 version,there was evidence that creams, tablets and the oestradiol vaginal ring appeared to be equally effective but more potent than placebo for the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. With respect to safety, there was evidence that the use of conjugated equine oestrogen cream resulted in more incidents of vaginal bleeding than oestrogen ring, as reported by two trials in 274 participants.</P>

<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. proportion of participants showing improvement in symptoms), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). For continuous data (e.g. endometrial thickness), we calculated mean differences (MDs) between treatment groups. We reversed the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes. Where data to calculate ORs or MDs were not available, we utilised the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of included studies (e.g. test statistics, P values). We assessed whether the estimates calculated in the review for individual studies were compatible in each case with the estimates reported in the study publications.</P>

In the current update, we did not exclude any studies for not reporting the review's relevant outcomes. Symptoms reported by the included studies were many and disparate, therefore we grouped symptoms found to be consistent across studies as composites, where appropriate. For participant-assessed improvement, the symptoms found to be consistent across studies were dryness, itching, dysuria and dyspareunia. For clinician-assessed improvement, the components of composite were vaginal mucosal pallor (pale appearance), petechiae (small red spots on the skin), friability (fragile and delicate tissue) and dryness. The components of breast disorders were: breast pain, enlargement and engorgement. We considered consistency in directions of effect estimates of individual components before we reported them as composites. Thus all symptoms grouped as composites have similar directions in effect estimates.</P>

<P>Twelve of the included studies measured improvement in symptoms, defined as the proportion of women showing cure or improvement (mild symptoms) in most bothersome symptoms relating to atrophy (participant-assessed at end point i.e. immediately after treatment) (<LINK REF="STD-Ayton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ayton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barentsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barentsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cano-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cano 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casper-1999-study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Casper 1999 study 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-Lara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia Lara 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hosseinzadeh-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hosseinzadeh 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lima-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lose-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lose 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manonai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manonai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simunic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Simunic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weisberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weisberg 2000</LINK>).

The evidence suggests that if the chance of improvement following placebo is assumed to be 29%, the chance following oestrogen tablets would be between 80% and 87%. We explored the presence of substantial heterogeneity between the two studies that contributed data to the meta analysis using sensitivity analysis. The results on using RR were similar to the results above, showing evidence of a difference in improvement in symptoms between the two treatment groups; however, a random-effects model showed no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement in symptoms between the two treatment groups (OR 5.80, 95% CI 0.88 to 38.29). In addition, although there were no variations in the directions of the effect estimates between the two studies, one of the studies demonstrated a substantial difference in symptom improvement between the two treatment groups while the other showed no evidence of a difference. A close look at the two studies showed some differences with respect to participants and doses of interventions. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-Lara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia Lara 1993</LINK> included women aged 43 to 45 years and treated them with vaginal ovules of oestradiol 3.5 mg, two per week in the first three weeks and one per week for the remaining weeks over a period of four months. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Simunic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Simunic 2003</LINK>) included women between 51 and 66 years who were treated with 25 µg of micronised 17&#946;-oestradiol vaginal tablet once a day over a period of two weeks and then twice a week for the remaining 12 months. This study was assessed as at high risk of attrition bias as the proportions of withdrawals differed between the two treatment groups and data were not analysed on the basis of ITT.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-30 15:48:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>This review assessed the efficacy and safety of available intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations, in particular the oestradiol-releasing ring versus oestrogen creams, tablets or placebo, oestrogen tablets versus oestrogen cream, placebo or oestriol tablets and oestrogen cream versus isoflavone gel, non-hormonal local bio adhesive vaginal moisturising gel, non-hormonal lubricant gel or placebo.</P>
<P>We assessed efficacy using participant-reported improvement in symptoms, clinician-assessed improvement in symptoms, and laboratory as well as cytological evidence of improvement in symptoms; decrease in vaginal pH; and increase in vaginal maturation indices. We assessed safety using evidence of increase in endometrial thickness; incidents of breast disorders, such as breast pain and engorgement; and total adverse events associated with the treatment.</P>
<P>From the overall body of the findings, there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in efficacy between the various oestrogenic preparations compared with each other. However, findings from the review showed that oestrogenic preparations were associated with better efficacy in terms of improvement in symptoms compared with sham treatment or placebo. With respect to safety, there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in the main adverse events (endometrial thickness, breast disorders and total adverse events) between oestrogenic preparations versus each other or placebo. Although two small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ayton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ayton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1995</LINK>; n = 273) reported an increase in endometrial thickness in women who were treated with oestrogen cream compared to those who received oestrogen ring, the evidence was of low quality due to a high level of uncertainty associated with the effect estimate. In addition the studies used higher doses of cream than now recommended in clinical practice. In one trial, 1 g of oestrogen cream was administered as a preparation containing 0.625 mg of conjugated equine oestrogen every night for 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ayton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ayton 1996</LINK>). In the other trial, 2 g of the preparation was administered three times weekly for 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1995</LINK>). The recommended dose of conjugated equine oestrogen administered vaginally is 0.625 mg daily for one to two weeks as an induction therapy, followed by low doses for maintenance therapy (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2014</LINK>). Typically this would be twice weekly in a clinical setting. Both studies thus used higher doses of cream than currently recommended in clinical practice which may have caused systemic absorption and increase in endometrial thickness. Further research using recommended doses of vaginal cream would be useful to confirm or refute this finding.</P>
<P>Effect estimates for both efficacy and safety measures were small with wide confidence intervals. The quality of the evidence for the GRADE-specific outcomes (participant-assessed improvement in symptoms, endometrial thickness, clinician-assessed improvement in symptoms and total adverse events) was either low (for most of the outcomes) or moderate, indicating a high level of uncertainty in the effect estimates which may change with further research.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-29 01:32:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review set out to examine the evidence in respect of the efficacy and safety associated with intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations in relieving the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. All the included studies investigated postmenopausal women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy in a broad range of comparisons, including oestrogenic preparations compared with each other, placebo or non oestrogenic preparations. Although diverse outcome measures were investigated by the included studies, a number of them were relevant to the review's main objectives. However, most of the comparisons were investigated in small trials which were not adequately powered to detect effect estimates with low levels of uncertainty. In addition, the disparate nature of the treatment regimens made it difficult to combine data in meta analyses. Similarly, six of the included studies could not be included in quantitative synthesis because either they did not report outcome measures relevant to the review or reported them in non usable form. Thus the evidence was largely based on a small number of underpowered trials resulting in effect estimates with wide confidence intervals. Most of the included studies did not investigate endometrial thickness, which was one of the review's primary outcomes. Similarly, few included studies investigated other adverse events (breast disorders and total adverse events). In all the included studies, data were either not reported on long-term outcomes or reported in non usable forms. We could not investigate the separate evidence of the effect of symptom duration and severity on the efficacy and safety of the various oestrogenic preparations due to insufficient data. This review excluded women with a history of severe atrophy and breast or endometrial cancer. Thus the efficacy and safety of local vaginal oestrogen were not assessed in this group of women. From a clinical point of view, it would be useful to consider these women in a future update of the review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-31 04:47:15 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All the identified interventions were subsumed under three main comparisons: oestrogen ring versus other regimens, oestrogen tablets versus other regimens and oestrogen cream versus other regimens. Four outcome measures were included in the 'Summary of findings' tables: improvement in symptoms (participant-assessed), endometrial thickness, improvement in symptoms (clinician-assessment) and adverse events (total adverse events). In oestrogen ring versus other regimens, data were available on all the GRADE-specific outcomes. The quality of the evidence was low for all the outcomes except total adverse events, with moderate-quality evidence. In the second comparison, oestrogen tablets versus other regimens, all the GRADE-specific outcomes were assessed. A similar pattern of findings were observed as in the first comparison. In the third and final comparison, oestrogen cream versus other regimens, findings on one of the GRADE-specific outcomes (endometrial thickness) were not incorporated into the table. The remaining outcomes were all of low quality.</P>
<P>Low-quality evidence implies that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate while moderate quality evidence while moderate-quality evidence means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>
<P>The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting (a majority of the included studies had most risk of bias domains assessed as unclear due to insufficient information) and imprecision due to small sample sizes or effect estimates with wide confidence intervals, or both.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-15 14:15:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched all the important databases and imposed no language restriction in the course of the search. However, we were mindful of the fact that these database searches might not have identified all the potentially eligible trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-31 05:21:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found one systematic review which examined the efficacy and safety of vaginal oestrogen for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Rahn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahn 2014</LINK>). In the review, 14 studies (n = 4232) compared vaginal oestrogen with placebo while 18 studies (n = 2236) compared one type of vaginal oestrogen preparation with another. In the first comparison (vaginal oestrogen versus placebo), women who were treated with vaginal oestrogen at the recommended doses consistently demonstrated evidence of more benefits with improvement in both genital and urinary symptoms compared to those who received placebo. The review, however, found no conclusive evidence of a difference in endometrial safety between the two treatment groups. In the second comparison (one vaginal oestrogen versus another), the review did not find evidence of differences in efficacy and safety between the different vaginal oestrogen preparations administered at the recommended doses and frequencies. These findings are consistent with those of this review.</P>
<P>In the 2013 position statement of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), which is based on cumulative evidence from many studies, intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations (oestrogen vaginal ring, oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream) are considered to be equally effective and well tolerated in the management of postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Lindah-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindah 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAMS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAMS 2013</LINK>). The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in its 2015 guidance for the management of menopause, recommends the use of vaginal oestrogen for the treatment of postmenopausal women with symptoms of urogenital atrophy without any preference for any oestrogenic preparations with respect to efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>). Similarly, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada states in its clinical practice guideline: "Conjugated estrogen cream, an intravaginal sustained-release oestradiol ring, and low-dose oestradiol vaginal tablets are recommended as effective treatment for vaginal atrophy." (<LINK REF="REF-SOGC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOGC 2014</LINK>). These findings are in agreement with those of this review which did not find evidence of a difference in efficacy and safety between the various oestrogenic preparations when compared with each other.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-31 05:21:17 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no conclusive evidence of a difference in efficacy between the various intravaginal oestrogenic preparations when compared with each other. However, there is low-quality evidence that intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations improve the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women when compared to placebo. There is low-quality evidence that oestrogen cream may be associated with increase in endometrial thickness compared to oestrogen ring, but this may have been due to the higher doses used. However there is no conclusive evidence of a difference in the overall body of evidence in adverse events between the various oestrogenic preparations compared with each other or with placebo. As previously noted, the low quality of the evidence resulted from poor reporting, with the review authors assessing a majority of the included studies as unclear in most risk of bias domains, due to insufficient information; and imprecision, due to small sample sizes or effect estimates with wide confidence intervals, or both.</P>
<P>These results should be applied in the context of improvement of the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations in the forms of creams, pessaries, tablets and the oestradiol-releasing ring are shown to be effective for the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. There are few trials comparing an intervention with placebo. The oestradiol vaginal ring can be considered as an effective and practical alternative to creams, pessaries and tablets. Dienoestrol cream has been withdrawn worldwide, and conjugated equine oestrogen cream has been withdrawn in New Zealand and Australia; 17ß oestradiol tablets in the dose of 25 µg have also been withdrawn worldwide and replaced with the lower dose 10 µg tablet. This is not available in New Zealand.</P>
<P>Women using intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations who have postmenopausal bleeding should have endometrial investigation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-29 01:51:33 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More well powered RCTs conducted in accordance with the CONSORT statement are required to adequately address the balance of efficacy and safety of the individual oestrogenic preparations for the management of postmenopausal women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2010</LINK>). Although not a subject of this review, there is the need for RCTs on the efficacy and safety of intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations in women with severe vaginal atrophy following treatment for breast or endometrial cancer. In addition, findings from this review can be further enriched by future trials which examine the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment. Intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations versus placebo should be investigated further. Future trials of intra-vaginal oestrogenic administration should consider investigating serum oestradiol levels, as some of the adverse events associated with treatment might be surrogate markers, indicating systemic absorption.</P>

<P>In the 2016 update the authors re-evaluated the importance of the outcomes and specified that they were either primary or secondary. Improvement of vaginal symptoms according to participants' own assessment was made a primary outcome, as this reflects the participants&#8217; own experiences. The primary safety outcome became endometrial thickness, as this is an important concern relating to local oestrogen administration. Other outcomes were specified as secondary: improvement in symptoms according to clinician assessment or laboratory parameters, other adverse events and adherence to treatment. The 2016 update also grouped symptoms so the assessed outcome was an aggregate measure. Previous versions of the review assessed individual symptoms and did not distinguish between primary and secondary outcomes.</P>
