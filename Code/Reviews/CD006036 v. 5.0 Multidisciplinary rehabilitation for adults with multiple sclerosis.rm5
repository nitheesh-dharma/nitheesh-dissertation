<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-01 20:16:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological condition, which can cause multiple disabilities and limit participation in young adults. This review looked for evidence of MD rehabilitation in adults with multiple sclerosis. The authors concluded there was strong evidence that inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation can lead to improvement in activity (disability) and in overall ability to participate in society, even though there is no reduction in actual impairment. There was limited evidence for short-term improvements in symptoms and disability, and in participation and quality of life with the high intensity outpatient and home-based rehabilitation programmes. For low intensity programmes conducted over a longer period there were longer term gains in quality of life; and for benefits to carers in terms of general health and engagement in social activities. The evidence available for other aspects of MD rehabilitation, including outpatient and home based therapy is not yet sufficient to allow many conclusions to be drawn.</P>

<P>Multidisciplinary (MD) rehabilitation is an important component of symptomatic and supportive treatment for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but evidence base for its effectiveness is yet to be established.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-04-28 18:40:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of organized MD rehabilitation in adults with MS. To explore rehabilitation approaches that are effective in different settings and the outcomes that are affected.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-05-23 19:36:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group's Trials Register (25 February 2011), PeDRO (1990 - 2011), the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field trials Register, the National Health Service National Research Register (NRR) and relevant journals were handsearched. No language restrictions were applied.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-04-28 21:03:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) that compared MD rehabilitation with routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or trials comparing interventions in different settings or at different levels of intensity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-04-28 21:03:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three reviewers selected trials and rated their methodological quality independently. A 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality was performed. Trials were grouped in terms of setting and type of rehabilitation and duration of patient follow up.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-28 21:03:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials (9 RCTs and 1 CCT) (954 participants and 73 caregivers) met the inclusion criteria. Eight RCTs scored well; while one RCT and one CCT scored poorly on the methodological quality assessment. Despite no change in the level of impairment, there was &#8217;strong evidence&#8217; to support inpatient MD rehabilitation in producing short-term gains at the levels of activity (disability) and participation in patients with MS. There is &#8216;moderate evidence&#8217; to support inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation programmes (compared with control wait-list groups) in improving disability; and bladder related activity and participation outcomes up to 12 months following MD rehabilitation intervention. For outpatient and home-based rehabilitation programmes there was 'limited evidence' for short-term improvements in symptoms and disability with high intensity programmes, which translated into improvement in participation and quality of life. For low intensity programmes conducted over a longer period there was 'strong evidence' for longer-term gains in quality of life; and also 'limited evidence' for benefits to carers. Although some studies reported potential for cost-savings, there is no convincing evidence regarding the long-term cost-effectiveness of these programmes. It was not possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy or supremacy of one therapy over another. This review highlights the limitations of RCTs in rehabilitation settings and need for better designed randomized and multiple centre trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>MD rehabilitation programmes do not change the level of impairment, but can improve the experience of people with MS in terms of activity and participation. Regular evaluation and assessment of these persons for rehabilitation is recommended. Further research into appropriate outcome measures, optimal intensity, frequency, cost and effectiveness of rehabilitation therapy over a longer time period is needed. Future research in rehabilitation should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-04 18:33:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-04 18:31:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease that is characterized by patchy inflammation, gliosis and demyelination within the central nervous system. It is the third most common cause of neurological disability in adults between 18-50 years of age after trauma and arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Dombovy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dombovy 1998</LINK>) affecting approximately 2.5 million worldwide and 20,000 persons in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-MS-Society-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">MS Society 2011</LINK>). Prevalence of MS (per 100,000 people) in Australia has been estimated at 40-80 in Victoria and Hobart, 30-35 in Perth and Newcastle (<LINK REF="REF-Hammond-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammond 1988</LINK>) compared with a much higher prevalence in Europe of 30-150 (<LINK REF="REF-Compston-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compston 1998</LINK>), and in the US 40-220 (<LINK REF="REF-Kraft-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraft 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact etiology of MS is unclear but is associated with an abnormal immune response within the central nervous system. An infectious agent has been implicated in its etiology (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>). MS has a latitudinal discrepancy and occurs more frequently in temperate regions away from the equator. The likelihood of a person getting the disease is predicted by a person's residence for the first 15 years of their life (<LINK REF="REF-Detels-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detels 1978</LINK>). MS is more common in females- 2.5:1 ratio.</P>
<P>The patterns of presentation in MS can vary.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Relapsing remitting </B>(RR) MS (80%) - This pattern is marked by exacerbations and remissions. The attacks may be followed by complete or near-complete recovery and the patient remains well until the next exacerbation.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Secondary progressive</B> (SP) MS: Over time person with RR MS may convert to a SP form of MS (<LINK REF="REF-Kraft-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraft 2005</LINK>), with progressive disability acquired between attacks.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Primary progressive </B>(PP) MS (15%). A smaller group of persons do not have acute attacks, but develop progressive disability from the onset. This form is less responsive to immunotherapy, has a more equal gender distribution and tends to have an older age of onset (<LINK REF="REF-Kraft-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraft 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 2002</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Progressive relapsing MS</B> (5%) - These patients begin worsening gradually and subsequently start to experience discrete attacks.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>) is commonly used to rate the neurological status of MS patients. It is a 10-point scale divided into half steps (0, 1, 1.5 etc. with 0= normal, 10= death due to MS). Patients with EDSS score of 3 have minimal disability, at 6 require a gait aid to ambulate and at 7 are wheelchair bound.</P>
<P>The prognosis in MS is variable, the rate of progression depends on type, severity and location of MS. Cognitive and behavioural problems can be subtle and often precede overt physical disability, but up to 50% will require a gait aid within 15 years of onset (<LINK REF="REF-Weinshenker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinshenker 1989</LINK>). Immune modulatory drugs have been shown to decrease relapse rates and produce a trend towards slowed accrual of impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Langdon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langdon 1999</LINK>). However a clinically meaningful effect of drug treatment in minimizing disability (activity) has not yet been demonstrated.</P>
<P>MS is a costly disease due to early onset, long disease duration, detrimental impact on functional status and issues of job retention/employment (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2000</LINK>). In 2001-2002, in Australia, the average annual direct and indirect costs per patient were estimated to be AU$20,396 and AU$15,085, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2007</LINK>). In United States, currently MS is estimated to cost $28 billion annually in medical costs and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Society-of-Neuroscience-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Society of Neuroscience 2011</LINK>). One study estimated the total lifetime cost per patient of MS in 1994 at $A 2.5 million (<LINK REF="REF-Whetten_x002d_Gol-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whetten-Gol 1998</LINK>). There is a positive correlation between EDSS score categories and rising cost of care (<LINK REF="REF-Patwardhan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patwardhan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The World Health Organization has developed an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) which defines a common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Impairments </B>are problems with body (anatomical) structures or (physiological) function- the symptoms and signs of disease such as paresis, pain etc</LI>
<LI>
<B>Activity limitation</B> (previously known as 'disability') (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) describes the difficulties that a person may have in executing everyday tasks such as self care</LI>
<LI>
<B>Restriction in participation</B> (previously known as handicap) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) relates to problems experienced by a person with involvement in societal participation and life situations such as employment, social activities.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Contextual factors</B> include: -Environmental factors which make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live their lives.-Personal factors include gender, race, self-efficacy, coping style, social and educational background which may affect the person's experience of living with their condition.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Person with MS (pwMS) can present to rehabilitation with various combinations of deficits, such as physical, cognitive, psychosocial, behavioural and environmental problems. Classified according to the WHO ICF, these include impairments (strength, coordination, balance, spasticity, memory, urinary urgency), which result in activity limitation (mobility, self care, incontinence, pain, cognitive deficits) and restriction in societal participation (impact on work, driving, family, finances). The issues of progressive physical disability, psychosocial adjustment, social reintegration progress over time (<LINK REF="REF-Frankel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankel 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-07-04 18:33:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rehabilitation may be defined as 'a problem-solving educational process aimed at reducing impairment (disability) and participation (handicap) experienced by someone as a result of disease or injury' (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1992</LINK>). Although it is sometimes effective in reducing impairment, its principal focus is on reducing symptoms and limitations at the level of activity and participation, through holistic interventions which include personal and environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, multidisciplinary (MD) (or interdisciplinary) rehabilitation was defined as 'an inpatient, outpatient, home or community-based coordinated intervention, delivered by two or more disciplines in conjunction with physician consultation (neurologist or rehabilitation medicine physician), which aims to limit patient symptoms, and enhance functional independence and maximise participation, as defined by ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The multiple disciplines include nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, orthotics, dietetics, social work, psychology or neuropsychology. Settings were either inpatient (hospital ward or specialist rehabilitation unit), outpatient (hospital or community), or home-based settings. Rehabilitation multidisciplinary care is usually tailored to suit an individual&#8217;s specific needs and therefore varies in content and intensity.</P>
<P>We included studies with interventions that satisfy the definition of MD care and which compared to some form of &#8216;control&#8217; condition, these include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>lower level or different types of intervention such as 'routinely available local services&#8217; (for example, medical and nursing care);</LI>
<LI>'minimal intervention&#8217; (such as 'information only&#8217;);</LI>
<LI>wait-list conditions;</LI>
<LI>intervention given in different settings;</LI>
<LI>lower intensity of intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We excluded studies with interventions that assessed the effect of therapy from a single discipline (for example, physiotherapy), or any unidisciplinary intervention or modality (for example, physical exercise).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-07-04 18:33:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Systematic reviews have demonstrated that holistic MD rehabilitation is effective in other neurological conditions such as Stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2002</LINK>), and Acquired Brain Injury (<LINK REF="REF-Turner_x002d_Stokes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner-Stokes 2005</LINK>), but the evidence base for the effectiveness in patients with MS is not yet established. A number of Cochrane reviews have addressed the effects of unidisciplinary or limited interventions.</P>
<P>Steultjens et al (<LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2003</LINK>) identified three trials with a total of 271 patients, which addressed the effects of energy conservation techniques and counselling, but were unable to identify clear benefits from these limited studies. They highlighted lack of properly controlled efficacy studies for most intervention categories of occupational therapy (OT).<BR/>Reitberg et al (<LINK REF="REF-Reitberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitberg 2004</LINK>) examined the effectiveness of exercise therapy (alone) in MS, identifying nine trials with a total of 260 patients. They found evidence for benefits in terms of power and mobility-related activities, and to a lesser extent in mood. However, these did not carry over into functional benefits in terms of activities of daily living or quality of life (QoL).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-05-23 18:28:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no systematic reviews of MD rehabilitation care in person with MS. Other reasons to do this review include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>There are inherent difficulties in demonstrating evidence-based effectiveness of rehabilitation through experimental trials due to heterogeneity of types of MS patients and disease manifestations, unpredictable disease course, the variety of rehabilitation services and inconsistent use of appropriate outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2002</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The MD rehabilitation intervention vary in different settings (inpatient, ambulatory), intensities and modalities of therapies, these need further investigation as there are associated cost implications.</LI>
<LI>Long-term MS related disability results in a significant burden of disease both for the patient and society as a whole.</LI>
<LI>Advances in medical care and increased life expectancy among persons with disabilities (including pwMS), the ongoing health and well being become increasingly important and require long-term planning for health service delivery. (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turk 2001</LINK>). From the rehabilitation perspective, the challenge is not just helping the pwMS become as independent as possible, but helping them stay independent in the community in the face of changes brought with aging (<LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2005</LINK>).</LI>

<P>This review is un update of the review first published in 2008.</P>
<P>This review analysed published (and unpublished) controlled trials relating to MS and rehabilitation, and specifically at MD rehabilitation in MS to identify the existing evidence base for MD rehabilitation in adults with MS, and to discuss issues for future expansion of the evidence base by traditional research and other methods.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:26:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of organized MD rehabilitation in adults with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), aged 18 years and above. To explore approaches that are effective in different settings, and the outcomes that are affected. Specific questions addressed by this review are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does organized MD rehabilitation achieve better outcomes than the absence of such services in pwMS?</LI>
<LI>Does organized MD rehabilitation achieve better outcomes than the absence of such services in caregivers of pwMS? </LI>
<LI>Which type of programmes are effective and in which setting?</LI>
<LI>Which specific outcomes are influenced (dependency, mood, social reintegration, return to work)?</LI>
<LI>Does a greater intensity (time and /or expertise) of rehabilitation lead to greater gains?</LI>
<LI>Are there demonstrable cost- benefits for multi disciplinary rehabilitation in MS?</LI>

<P>All trials that stated or implied use of MD or interdisciplinary rehabilitation intervention were included. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that were included compared MD rehabilitation with either routinely available local services; or lower or minimal levels of intervention; or wait list conditions; or intervention in different settings or at different levels of intensity.</P>
<P>In this review, definition of a clinical trial used was 'a prospective experimental evaluation of a clinical intervention that assesses its outcome against those of a control group' (<LINK REF="REF-Fuhrer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuhrer 2005</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-04-07 14:53:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>Trials were included if the study population had the diagnosis of MS based on the validated criteria (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumaker-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumaker 1965</LINK>), above 18 years of age and of either gender. These participants included all diagnostic subgroups of MS and all stages of disease such as relapsing remitting (RR), primary progressive (PP) and secondary progressive (SP) MS.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:27:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>All trials included MD or interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. These comprise elements of physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech pathology (SP), psychology and or neuropsychology (NP), cognitive therapy and or behaviour management, social work (SW), nutrition, orthotics, counselling input, recreation and vocational therapy.</P>
<P> The setting of rehabilitation programmes included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Inpatient rehabilitation settings that provide 24 hour care, such as a specialist medical rehabilitation unit or a hospital ward unit (general medical unit, neurology)</LI>
<LI>Outpatient or day treatment settings, located within the hospital, a community centre/ day centre or a specialist rehabilitation environment.</LI>
<LI>Home-based setting in the patients' own home and local community.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>For the purpose of this review, intensity of MD rehabilitation programme was subdivided into 'high' or 'low' intensity.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High intensity therapy involved input from at least two disciplines, a minimum of thirty minutes per session and total duration of at least 2-3 hours of interrupted therapy per day for at least 4 days per week. This is usually provided in inpatient settings and some outpatient programmes.</LI>
<LI>Low intensity programmes varied, the intensity and duration of therapy was lesser than that provided in inpatient rehabilitation settings and was dependent upon the type of rehabilitation setting and available resources</LI>
</UL>
<P>All studies that involved a MD or an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme were included, provided they compared the named intervention with some form of control condition. For the purpose of this review the control conditions considered were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A lower level or different type of intervention such as 'routinely available local services' or 'minimal intervention such as' information only' or 'single session treatment'</LI>
<LI>MD Interventions given in different settings, such as inpatient versus community rehabilitation</LI>
<LI>Lower intensity of treatment programmes</LI>
<LI>Wait list conditions</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies assessing the effect of the following were excluded:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Therapy from a single discipline (physiotherapy), including studies on intensity of treatment within that discipline</LI>
<LI>A single uni-disciplinary intervention or modality (e.g., physical exercise)</LI>
<LI>Efficacy of occupational therapy programmes - already dealt with Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2003</LINK>) - except where it formed part of a coordinated multidisciplinary approach.</LI>
<LI>Programmes that included complementary medicine (yoga, meditation) in the absence of rehabilitation.</LI>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-07-04 18:46:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were included if outcomes were reported at the level of activity or participation according to the WHO ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Studies where outcomes were reported only at the level of impairment were excluded.</P>
<P>Outcomes were categorized as indicated in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> into:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Those that focus on impairment (muscle tone and strength);</LI>
<LI>Those that focus on goals at the level of limitation in activities (disabilities), such as the Functional Independence Measure (<LINK REF="REF-Granger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granger 1990</LINK>) with domains for self care, mobility, communication and cognition;</LI>
<LI>Those that focus on goals at the level of participation, environmental and/or personal context. These include QoL, psychosocial adjustment, social integration in pwMS and caregiver mood.</LI>
<LI>Those reflecting other outcomes such as associated costs, service utilization, caregiver burden.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>It should be noted however that some outcome scales crossed boundaries between these ICF concepts,for example include items relating to both impairment (symptoms) and activity.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:15:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>The reviewers (FK, BA, LN, LTS) independently screened all abstracts and titles of studies that were identified by the search strategy for inclusion and appropriateness based on the selection criteria. Once all potentially appropriate studies had been obtained, each study was independently evaluated by the three reviewers for inclusion. If necessary, further information was obtained to determine if the trial met the criteria. If no consensus was met about the possible inclusion/exclusion of any individual study, a final consensus decision was made by discussion amongst all the reviewers. If there was still no consensus agreement regarding inclusion/exclusion of the study, then the full article was to be submitted to the editorial board for arbitration. Reviewers were not masked to the name(s) of the author(s), institution(s) or publication source at any level of the review.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:15:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>Three reviewers independently extracted the data from each study that met the inclusion criteria. If insufficient data were available, then authors were contacted to provide data and clarification. If the data were unavailable or insufficient, the study was reported but not included in the final analysis. All studies that met the inclusion criteria were summarized in the 'Included Studies' table provided in the Review Manager software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration (RevMan 5.1.1) to include details on design, participants, interventions, and outcomes.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:11:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>The methodological quality of studies included in this review were assessed independently by the reviewers (FK, LN, BA, LTS). The methodological quality criteria proposed by Van Tulder (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) were used for assessing internal validity, descriptive and statistical criteria (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>: Assessment of Methodological Quality). This criteria list draws from the previous Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group list (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>), which incorporated the three Jadad criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>): randomization (subsequently developed to include concealment of allocation), double blinding (participant and outcome assessor) and description of withdrawals (subsequently developed to include intention to treat analysis).</P>
<P>The van Tulder et al (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) criteria consist of 11 methodological criteria for internal validity. In addition, for improved sensitivity and discrimination between high and poor quality trials, we included the four remaining descriptive and two statistical criteria from the earlier list (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>) giving a total of 17 criteria. All items on the methodological criteria list had equal weight. Each item was scored at 2 points for 'Yes', 1 for 'Don't know', and 0 for 'No', and item scores were summated to a single total score. Any disagreements regarding scoring were resolved by consensus between reviewers. Studies were considered to be of high methodological quality if the score was at least 50% - i.e., 11 out of 22 for the internal validity criteria, 4 out of 8 for descriptive criteria and 2 out of 4 for statistical criteria. Studies scoring 50% out of a total maximum score of 34 were considered of high methodological quality. Studies were rated low methodological quality if they achieved less than these scores.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:33:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhasker Amatya">
<P>A quantitative analysis was not possible due to the use of diverse outcome measures and other clinical heterogeneity. Therefore, qualitative synthesis of "best evidence" was presented based on the levels of evidence proposed by Van Tulder et al (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) as detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.

<B>Participant characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The participants of studies considered in this review included 954 (920 completers) persons with MS and 73 caregivers. This included the 207 persons with MS from the two new identified studies (including one study with two reports) (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK>).

Most included studies describe a neurologist's assessment of patient eligibility for inclusion. Criteria for exacerbation or relapse of MS however were not always defined.</P>
<P>In the three trials that compared 'Inpatient rehabilitation with controls', the mean EDSS scores were between 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>) and 6.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK> included only patients with relapsing-remitting MS, <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK> considered progressive MS (primary and secondary) while <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK> included participants with all types of MS (63% secondary progressive). The disease duration range of the participants was from 0 to 37 years. Approximately two-thirds of the participants were women (range 64 - 67%) with a mean age ranged from 40 to 51.5 years.</P>
<P>The preliminary trial by <LINK REF="STD-Francabandera-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Francabandera 1988</LINK> was the only study comparing 'Inpatient rehabilitation with outpatient therapy'. Although originally targeted at 24 months, the analysis in this report was limited to 3 months. However despite contacting the centre we were unable to trace any further report of the study. The participant EDSS scores ranged from 6 to 9, but the types of MS, mean disease duration and mean age of participants were not specified, and could not be provided by the author.</P>
<P>One trial with two reports (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>) compared &#8216;Inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation with controls&#8217;. The primary patient cohort in this trial included all types of MS (more than half were secondary progressive). The participant EDSS score ranged from 2 - 8, with majority (58.4%) in EDSS score range of 3.5 to 6.0. The mean disease duration was 10.2 years. Approximately two-thirds were women (71%) with a mean age of 50.3 years (range 29-65 years).</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Pozzilli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzilli 2002</LINK> comparing 'Home rehabilitation with a control group' included patients with a slightly wider range of EDSS scores (3.6 to 8.0). It included both relapsing-remitting, and progressive MS (primary and secondary). Again two-thirds of the sample were women, with a mean age of 47 years and disease duration 18.5 years.</P>
<P>For the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guagenti_x002d_Tax-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guagenti-Tax 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK>) comparing 'Outpatient rehabilitation with controls', the severity of disease (EDSS scores) ranged from 4 to 8.5, and crossed the range of MS types. The proportion of women ranged from 56-100%, mean age 44-49 years and mean disease duration of the subjects was wide ranging (1 to 40 years).<BR/>

<B>A) Effectiveness of Inpatient MD therapy versus control </B>
</P>
<P>The three trials addressing the efficacy of inpatient MD rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK>) recruited a total of 217 patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK> compared individualized inpatient MD rehabilitation (for approximately 3-5 weeks) with a wait-list control group that received no intervention. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>, focused specifically on patients admitted following an acute relapse of MS. Both groups received intravenous methylprednisolone, but in addition, the treatment group received a programme of MD rehabilitation (either on an in-patient or day-patient basis) while the control group received only standard care (which included therapy intervention according to local availability (quantity unspecified).</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>) were rated as good quality RCTs on all assessment criteria, although both were unblinded and intention to treat was unspecified. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK> was of low quality due to a number of methodological flaws - it was quasi-randomised and despite reporting double-blinding, the method for patient blinding was unspecified. The follow up periods were at 6 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>), 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>) and two further follow ups with an interval of 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooling of data from these three studies was confounded by the design differences high-lighted above, and in addition by the use of different outcome measures.</P>
<P>For assessment at the level of impairment, <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK> used EDSS, <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK> used the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) whilst <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK> used EDSS<B> </B>and the MS Impairment Scale (MSIS).<BR/>At the level of activity, <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK> used the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) as the primary outcome measure, <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK> used the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS) and Barthel Index (BI) whilst <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK> used GNDS, Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) and Timed 10-meter walking test (TW10).<BR/>At the level of participation and quality of life, <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK> used the London Handicap Scale (LHS), <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK> used the Human Activities Profile (HAP) and SF-36 whilst <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK> used Life Appreciation and Satisfaction Questionnaire (LASQ) and the Functional Assessment in MS (FAMS) scales.</P>
<P>Despite no change at the level of impairment, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>) showed modest benefits at the level of activities and participation, but these were not reflected in quality of life scores (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK>, however, did not demonstrate any benefits at the level of impairment, disability (activities) or participation.</P>
<P>The best evidence synthesis from these three RCTs (217 patients) suggests:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Strong evidence that organised MD rehabilitation can improve overall disability as measured by the total FIM (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>) and the BI (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>); and overall level of participation in favour of the treatment group as measured by LHS (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>) and HAP (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Moderate evidence that inpatient rehabilitation can improve symptoms as measured by the GNDS (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>); and self care and sphincter control as measured by FIM (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>); mobility and locomotion (wheelchair users only) in the study by (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>), measured by the AMCA (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>) and FIM (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>).</LI>

<P>
<B>B) Effectiveness of Inpatient rehabilitation versus Outpatient rehabilitation: </B>
</P>
<P>One study with 84 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Francabandera-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Francabandera 1988</LINK>) compared the effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation with outpatient rehabilitation in persons with severe MS. The follow up was completed either by a nurse via phone or when the patient visited the MS Center. Although this RCT reached the requirements for high methodological quality on the assessment criteria, it was unblinded and intention to treat was not specified. Details of participants and interventions such as length of rehabilitation and contents of the outpatient rehabilitation programme were not given and could not be obtained from authors. The participant attrition rate was high at 13%. In addition, the groups were poorly matched for incapacity status (ISS) at baseline (t=2.18 p&lt;0.05), so that analysis of covariance was used to adjust for this at the outcome assessment point. Originally planned with a 2 year follow up period, this report presents only the 3 month data, and we were unable to find any further published reports of this trial or to obtain further data from the author.</P>
<P>According to this report, the ambulatory status and independence in self care (ISS) improved by two points for the in-patient group, whilst deteriorating slightly (1.5 points) for the outpatients, resulting in a statistically significant effect in favour of in-patient treatment group at 3 months. However, there was no difference between the groups in their need for aids and home care - indeed both showed a trend towards increased need for assistance.</P>
<P>The best evidence synthesis of this study (84 patients) suggests:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Limited evidence that inpatient rehabilitation in persons with MS can result in greater short-term gains at the level of activity (ambulatory status and independence in self-care (ISS) compared with the outpatient care.</LI>
<LI>No evidence was offered at the level of participation</LI>
<LI>In addition, there was no evidence that these benefits result in reduction in the need for aids or assistance at home, which might have translated into cost-effectiveness, and the longer term benefits are unknown.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>C) Effectiveness of Inpatient or Outpatient MD therapy versus control</B>
</P>
<P>One trial with two reports (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>) addressed efficacy of inpatient or outpatient MD rehabilitation in a total of 101 patients with MS. <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK> compared individualized MD inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation (for approximately 3-6 weeks) with a wait-list control group. Although breakdown of the number of inpatient versus outpatient participants was provided, further subgroup analysis was not presented. <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>, specifically included only patients with bladder issues (n = 74) from the original cohort and focused on individualised MD inpatient or outpatient bladder management compared with control wait-list group (managed in the community by their usual treating doctors) in a MD rehabilitation programme.</P>
<P>At the level of activity, <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK> used the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) as the primary outcome measure; and the Multiple sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS29) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ28) for measuring participation. <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK> used the Guy&#8217;s Neurological Disability Scale (NDS) (bladder subscale only), Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI6), American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA) scale for symptoms and activity (disability). While measures for participation included the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ7), and a single QoL item in the AUA scale.</P>
<P>The trial was rated as good quality on all assessment criteria. The follow up period was 12 months.</P>
<P>The synthesis of best evidence from this study (101 patients) suggests:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Moderate evidence to support the effectiveness of the inpatient or outpatient MD rehabilitation programme in reducing disability (FIM) (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>); and bladder impairment and &#8216;activity limitation&#8217; outcomes (UDI6, NDS, AUA) (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Moderate evidence that inpatient or outpatient MD bladder rehabilitation improves continence-related QoL and participation outcomes (AUA, IIQ7) (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of the inpatient or outpatient MD rehabilitation programme for improvement in participation and patient QoL (MSIS29, GHQ28) (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>D) Effectiveness of MD Home rehabilitation versus control</B>
</P>
<P>Only one study addressed the effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation in MS compared with a control group (<LINK REF="STD-Pozzilli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzilli 2002</LINK>) reported a reasonably high quality study for 201 participants with definite MS, although once again, the study was unblinded and intention to treat was unspecified, as was the amount of therapy received. The study aimed to assess the benefits and cost effectiveness of a coordinated multi-disciplinary home-based rehabilitation programme, compared with a control group receiving standard out-patient hospital care at their usual MS referral centre.</P>
<P>The outcome point was at 12 months and 188 patients reached this point (6.5% attrition). No difference was found in activity measures (both FIM and FSS) between the home-based programme group and standard outpatient hospital care group. There was however significant difference in four SF-36 health dimensions (bodily pain, general health, social functioning and emotional role) favouring home-based management. The cost of home-based care was slightly less (&#8364; 822 euros/patient/year) than hospital care, mainly due to decreased hospital admissions. The authors concluded from this study that MD home-based rehabilitation may provide a cost-effective approach to management of persons with MS and improve their quality of life.</P>
<P>Based on this one reasonably high quality study (201 patients), the best evidence synthesis suggests:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Limited evidence that MD home based rehabilitation can produce significant advantage over standard hospital care in some domains of patient quality of life- (SF-36) for up to 12 months, despite no change at the level of activity (disability).</LI>
<LI>Whilst there may be potential for reducing service costs if hospital admissions are avoided, actual evidence for cost effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>E) Effectiveness of MD Outpatient rehabilitation versus control</B>
</P>
<P>Four studies examined the effects of out- patient rehabilitation programmes for MS. Two reports of the same study by Patti et al (<LINK REF="STD-Patti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2003</LINK>) examined the short-term effects of a high intensity out- patient rehabilitation programme in 111 patients. The other three studies (one with 2 reports) (<LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guagenti_x002d_Tax-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guagenti-Tax 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1998</LINK>) (total 240 patients) addressed the effects of a low intensity outpatient rehabilitation programme compared with control group with MS with a longer-term follow up (more than 6 months). Attrition rates were unfortunately high: 24% in <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1998</LINK>, 30% in <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1997</LINK>, and 38% in <LINK REF="STD-Guagenti_x002d_Tax-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guagenti-Tax 2000</LINK>; although not sufficient to cause exclusion of the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2003</LINK> assessed the effect of a high intensity outpatient rehabilitation programme (six days per week) for 6 weeks, followed by a home self exercise programme for 6 weeks in a randomized, single blind controlled trial. The control group received only home exercises. The study was of high methodological quality on all criteria assessed. The first report (<LINK REF="STD-Patti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2002</LINK>) addressed outcomes at the level of participation, mood and quality of life, and the second (<LINK REF="STD-Patti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2003</LINK>) at the level of activities (disability). Despite no change in impairment (EDSS scores) or cognitive function (FIM cognitive score), the treatment group showed significant improvements in self-care, mobility, transfer skills and continence (as measured by the FIM motor scale) compared with controls; and also in quality of life (SF-36), mood (Beck Depression Inventory), fatigue (FIS) and social function (SET).<BR/>
<BR/>Of the three studies addressing lower intensity programmes, two were unblinded RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Guagenti_x002d_Tax-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guagenti-Tax 2000</LINK>) of reasonably high methodological quality on assessment criteria. The third (<LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1998</LINK>) was a non-randomised controlled trial (CCT) which therefore scored poorly on many of the items of internal validity and achieved an overall 'low quality' grading, although it fared better on descriptive and statistical criteria.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stuifbergen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuifbergen 2003</LINK> examined the effects of an 8-week MD group-based outpatient "wellness intervention programme" for women with MS on health behaviours and quality of life, compared with a wait-list control group who received their programme after the last data collection point (n=121). Data collection points were at the beginning and end of the programme and at 3 and 6 months post rehabilitation. Data at the level of impairment and activity (ISS) were provided only at baseline and 6 month follow-up to confirm group comparability, and they did not change in either group. Measures of participation such as barriers to health promoting activities and personal support were also similar for the two groups. A hierarchical linear modelling regression technique was used to avoid bias from repeated measures data and showed a statistically significant 'group by time' effect for self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours and for the 'mental health' and 'pain' scales of the SF-36. The treatment group were also more likely to be employed than the control group at follow-up. The authors concluded that low intensity therapy and education improves health behaviours and some dimensions of QOL for women with MS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guagenti_x002d_Tax-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guagenti-Tax 2000</LINK> compared low intensity MD group based therapy for patients and caregivers for 12 months (twice-monthly groups and 10 workshops) compared with standard care (which was not specified) (total 73 patient-caregiver units). Outcomes were measured at 12 and 24 months. This complex study included a large number of parameters, with no apparent attempt to correct for multiple statistical tests, and the analysis was sometimes hard to follow. Both groups declined significantly over the two year period in terms of impairment and physical functioning (EDSS and ISS) and in cognitive deficits; and both groups reported increased satisfaction with caregiver help. However, in terms of participation a significant interaction was seen on the SF-36 general health subscale, for both patients and carers with the control group reporting a greater decline in perceived health. Caregivers in the control group also reported greater interference with social activities over time. The authors concluded that the outpatient therapy and carer/patient education improved patient perceived health and anxiety.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1998</LINK>, examined extended low intensity outpatient therapy (1 day per week for 1 year) compared with a wait-list control group in a total of 46 subjects. Outcomes were measured at 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1998</LINK> reports outcomes at the level of impairment and functional status (Symptom checklist, fatigue and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago Functional Assessment scale). <LINK REF="STD-DiFabio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">DiFabio 1997</LINK> reports outcomes at the level of participation and quality of life (SF-36 and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Questionnaire). The principal findings from this study were that patients receiving out-patient rehabilitation had significantly reduced frequency of symptoms and fatigue (F 1, 30 =9.68, p=0.004) at one year compared to the control group. The treatment group also showed small improvements in six quality of life measures (fatigue, general health, social function and support). These did not improve in the control group. No data were presented on cost benefit or other utility measures.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-06-01 20:16:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review investigated the effectiveness of organized MD rehabilitation in adults with MS based on measures of activities and participation in the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>), and also of utility and service costs. Unfortunately, there was a large degree of variation in patient baseline characteristics and severity of MS, stages of MS, measurement tools used (even for identical outcomes), treatment and control protocols and length of follow up in these studies. Because of this heterogeneity, it was not possible to pool data statistically. Instead best evidence synthesis was performed using a qualitative analysis.</P>
<P>We found &#8217;strong evidence&#8217; that inpatient MD can produce short-term gains at the levels of activity impairment (disability) and participation for patients with MS. There is &#8216;moderate evidence&#8217; to support inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation programmes (compared with control wait-list groups) in improving disability; and bladder related activity and participation outcomes up to 12 months following rehabilitation intervention. This updated review increases the body of evidence for centre-based MD rehabilitation programmes. For outpatient and home-based rehabilitation programmes there was 'limited evidence' for short-term improvements in symptoms and disability with high intensity programmes, which translated into improvement in participation and quality of life. For low intensity programmes conducted over a longer period there was 'strong evidence' for longer term gains in quality of life (albeit to a modest degree and not in all domains); and also 'limited evidence' for benefits to carers in terms of general health and engagement in social activities. Although some studies reported potential for cost-savings, at the current time there is no convincing evidence regarding the long-term cost-effectiveness of these programmes.</P>
<P>The strength of findings was limited by the small number of studies and in some cases by methodological weaknesses. All of the studies were single centre trials, with fairly small participant numbers, with a risk of type I and II errors. Many of the trials, particularly in outpatient settings used a larger number of statistical tests without adjustment of the level of probability. Details of the participants and the interventions were frequently missing and were not obtainable from the authors despite attempts to contact them.</P>
<P>Local practices tended to vary in different countries (US, UK, Italy, Denmarkand Australia) making it harder to interpret and compare outcomes. The issues of design in MD health services intervention are complex. The &#8216;real life&#8217; clinical settings may have operational issues such as relating to rehabilitation &#8216;slots&#8217; availability within health service, appropriate staffing levels for timely intervention etc. In several of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2006</LINK>), rehabilitation programmes were individually tailored for MS participants and therefore not possible to standardize across the care spectrum. This heterogeneity may reflect the wide variety of the rehabilitation programmes in different settings and under different healthcare system. From this review, it has not been possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy, further studies are needed to suggest optimum number, duration and intensity of treatment sessions.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of rehabilitation are possible, but rarely seen in practice. Only one trial with two reports (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2010</LINK>), reported adverse effects attributable to the rehabilitation. Fatigue is a major issue in MS, and many of the studies measured fatigue, but none showed an increase in fatigue as a result of rehabilitation.</P>
<P>This review has served to highlight some of the limitations and challenges for randomised controlled trial methodologies in complex interventions such as rehabilitation for chronic degenerative conditions. Previous authors (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner_x002d_Stokes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner-Stokes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>) have highlighted some of these limitations which include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Rehabilitation is a complex form of treatment which is difficult to quantify, and may include multiple interventions, and depends on the interaction between the patient and the clinician. Programmes frequently involve dynamic interplay in behaviour between patient and therapist, which are dependent upon patient response and potentially confound simple division into 'treatment' and 'control' conditions.</LI>
<LI>The target population is characterised by relatively small numbers of patients with marked heterogeneity within participants in terms of disease type, clinical presentation, goals for treatment. A large pool of patients or 'pure participants' would be required to minimize confounding impairments, and this is often beyond the capacity of a single institution. Multi-centre trials may provide larger numbers but often at the expense of increased heterogeneity, with little net benefit.</LI>
<LI>In longer term conditions, intervention must be evaluated over a significant period of time and this may lead to difficulties with recruitment and retention, especially in the control groups. There may also be ethical and consent issues, particularly where patients have cognitive deficits arising from their condition.</LI>
<LI>True 'blinding' of participants and care providers is rarely possible in the context of rehabilitation, and attempts to blind outcome assessor may be confounded if patients unwittingly volunteer information about their treatment during the course of assessment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>More recently an alternative approach to gathering evidence was trial led through the use of &#8216;clinical practice trials&#8217; that acquire prospective and retrospective data without disrupting the natural milieu of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gassaway-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gassaway 2005</LINK>). This routine data collection can provide additional information about the nature of services provided, the outcomes and models of care for rehabilitation and implications for clinicians. This approach was used recently in a pilot study in an inpatient MS population (n=24) to quantify the intensity and frequency of rehabilitation to understand patient complexity and need for therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2010a</LINK>). More work is needed to build evidence base in this context and identify components comprising the &#8216;black box&#8217; of rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Persons with MS often have complex issues. Clinicians may not always agree with one another or incorporate the perspective of the person with MS and/or caregivers. The clinical decision making process can be subjective and biased (<LINK REF="REF-Elstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elstein 2002</LINK>). The use of only standardized instruments for functional assessments can also cause bias (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>). One patient centred outcome process is the use of &#8216;goal attainment scaling&#8217; (GAS) procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Kiresuk-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiresuk 1968</LINK>). In one MS inpatient cohort, GAS was found to be more meaningful compared with standard outcomes measures (FIM, BI), as it evaluated outcomes considered important by patients (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2008a</LINK>). Incorporation of the perspectives of patients with MS (and their carers) can facilitate clinical decision making processes and approaches. In one study of persons with MS (n=101), their self reported problems were linked with the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2007a</LINK>) for incorporation in MD care programmes. Further, an expert consensus opinion (used a Delphi exercise) about issues that should be addressed in MD programmes for pwMS was also reported (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2007b</LINK>). Lists of ICF categories or &#8216;core set&#8217; was selected by experts to facilitate clinical care and agreement, and these in the future may assist in outcome development in MS using the ICF item banking and scale development techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Cieza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cieza 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grill-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grill 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assimilation of data from different trial also poses challenges because of marked heterogeneity in intervention type and setting; and also with respect to the outcome measures used and time points for assessment. Floor/ceiling effects may limit sensitivity to treatment effects, and even the most carefully standardised measures may behave differently in different cultures and settings (<LINK REF="REF-Tennant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennant 2002</LINK>). In this review we have attempted to subdivide outcomes into the levels of impairment, activity (disability) and participation as described by the WHO ICF. However, many of the measures straddle these concepts and include items at different levels. For example, the EDSS includes a mixture of impairment and disability, and whilst it may provide useful categorisation of disease severity, it is not a sensitive outcome measure for rehabilitation which generally does not alter impairment.</P>
<P>Many of the outcomes measures used in MS trials were primarily designed for other conditions (for example the London Handicap Scale was developed for use in stroke patients and the SF-36 for general populations). These scales may not be sensitive to changes peculiar to fluctuating conditions such as MS (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>). Although specific measures, such as the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) (<LINK REF="REF-Hobart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobart 2001</LINK>) have since been developed for use in this context, these have yet to be widely taken up and most of the trials included in this review pre-dated their development. Newer techniques of data analyses such as application of Rasch analyses can convert ordinal data to interval estimates, which allow improved measurement (<LINK REF="REF-Ramp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramp 2009</LINK>). Rasch analyses can demonstrate significant difference in responsiveness at the &#8216;individual person&#8217; level rather than &#8216;group level&#8217; estimates. This technique is recommended for future rehabilitation trials. </P>
<P>Finally, more research is needed (at national and international level) to study the variability and outcomes of MS rehabilitation programmes, to improve data collection and identify health service planning needs. One recent report (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2009</LINK>) used the Australian national rehabilitation dataset to review the rehabilitation outcomes of 1100 pwMS (over a 5 year period) from 162 accredited rehabilitation facilities across Australia. Analysis of outcome measures showed that following inpatient rehabilitation, there was reduction in disability (FIM) and in hospital length of stay, and increased discharge of these persons back into the community. This study highlighted need for further research to improve standardized data collection in the national datasets for the information to be more clinically meaningful in the future.</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of this review</B>
</P>
<P>The assimilation of available evidence was challenging due to the diversity of trials in this review. The authors accept that there may have been a degree of:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias from the literature search (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>) if trials have not been published due to they have small patient numbers and negative results</LI>
<LI>reference bias (<LINK REF="REF-Goetzsche-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetzsche 1987</LINK>) for published studies included in this review.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The review has taken an inclusive approach to a broad area of clinical practice and this approach has posed significant challenges for the assessment and assimilation of the available evidence. It may be contended that we have adopted too low threshold for inclusion of studies of low quality. On the other hand, we believe that the presented synthesis of 'best evidence' based on assessment of methodological quality, has facilitated a helpful comparison of the various studies available. It also allows open acknowledgement of the 'limited evidence' which comes from these poorer (or single ) studies which is nevertheless the best available at the current time.</P>
<P>Our attempt to categorise evidence according to the WHO ICF posed some methodological problems, since many of the outcome measures used in trials crossed the boundaries between the different levels of the model. However we still believe that this model is helpful to clarify the experience of people who live with long term neurological conditions.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary and future research</B>
</P>
<P>Based on a qualitative synthesis of best evidence, this review suggests that, despite no change at the level of impairment, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation can improve the experience of people living with multiple impairment in terms of both activity and participation. However, the evidence for cost-effectiveness is as yet 'suggestive' and further direct evidence is required. No adverse effects of rehabilitation intervention were reported, and it was not possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy or supremacy of one therapy over another.</P>
<P>With spiraling health care costs and the increased demand for rehabilitation services, it has become increasingly important to justify expense of rehabilitation services. This review highlights the limitations of RCTs in rehabilitation settings and the need for better designed randomized and multiple centre trials; also the use of complimentary research methods to build a rounded evidence-base in this area. The perspective of the person with MS should be incorporated; and participation issues relevant to MS (such as return to work, driving, community reintegration, leisure, parenting and psychosocial issues) need further evaluation.</P>

<P>The evidence presented in this review supports the recommendation that patients with all types of MS should undergo regular specialist evaluation and follow up to assess their need for appropriate rehabilitation intervention as well as maintenance therapy in order to maximise their capacity for independent living and societal participation. The type and setting of the rehabilitation treatment (inpatient, community) should be individualized based on patients' specific needs. Inclusion or exclusion of patients for rehabilitation shortly after relapse is available only for some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>) and could be a significant confounding factor when it is not reported or where there is a significant imbalance between treatment and control groups. Gaps in this knowledge could then suggest directions for future research. The needs of their caregivers should also be addressed.</P>

<TD>
<P>A. Method of randomization was positively scored if a random assignment sequence was used (computer generated random table number and/or use of opaque sealed envelopes).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>B. Concealment of treatment allocation was scored positively where an independent person generated the assignment and was not responsible for determining eligibility of the patients. A central randomization scheme involved numbered or coded containers such as on-site computer systems that provided allocation in locked unreadable files accessible only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant and sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. If concealment of treatment allocation was described only as randomized, it was considered unclear.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>C. To get a positive score the groups had to be similar at baseline (regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurologic symptoms and value of main outcome measures).</P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>D. The reviewer determines if enough information about blinding is given to score a 'yes'.</P>

<TD>
<P>F. The reviewer determines if enough information about blinding is given to score a 'yes'.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>G. Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or should be similar between index and control groups to score a 'yes'.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>H. The reviewer determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on reported intensity, duration and number of sessions for both index intervention and control intervention, to score a 'yes'.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>I. The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop outs does not exceed 20% for short term follow-up and 30% for long term follow-up and does not led to a substantial bias, a 'yes' is scored.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>J. Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments to score a 'yes'.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>K. All randomized patients are analysed in the group they were allocated to by randomization, for the most important moment of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non- compliance and co-interventions to score a 'yes'</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>L. The reviewer determines whether the participant inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry were clearly defined to score a 'yes'.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>M. The reviewer determines whether details of the index and control interventions were explicitly described - including disciplines involved and treatment duration. For example, whether a clearly defined treatment protocol was present.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>N. Each adverse event should be described and attributed to the allocated treatment. If it is explicably reported that no adverse effects have occurred, a 'yes' should be scored.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>O. The outcomes measured within 6 months of intervention period (short term) or after 6 months of randomization (long term) should be scored 'yes' if mentioned.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>P. To be presented for each group at randomization and for most important outcome assessments to score a 'yes'. Therefore in contrast to previous lists there is no preset cut-off point to determine whether sample size is sufficient.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Q. Both point estimates and measures of variability should be presented (to be scored for each important outcome parameter separately) to score a 'yes'. Point estimates include means, medians and modes. Measures of variability include standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Other procedures used included:</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Blinding: Single blinding of outcome assessors was scored positive only if assessors were blinded regarding treatment allocation and when standardized assessment measures or procedures were used to structure interviews.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Patient blinded to intervention is unlikely in rehabilitation settings if consent procedures were applied.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Intention to treat (ITT): was scored positive if all patients randomized to the intervention group were included in the analysis regardless of non- compliance and co-interventions. If loss to follow-up was substantial (20% or greater), an ITT analysis, as well as an alternative analysis, which accounts for missing values (eg. worst case analysis) should have been performed.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Eligibility criteria: scored positive if a list of explicit inclusion/ exclusion criteria was provided.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Outcome measures relevant: outcome measures reflecting limitation in impairment, activity (disability) and participation as relevant to the intervention.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Adverse effects can occur with rehabilitation intervention. We looked for evidence on report of adverse effects in the included trials for this review.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Fatal flaws in studies included: withdrawals of more than 40% of patients, non-adherence to the protocol and poor or non-adjusted comparability in the baseline criteria. These studies were considered inadequate for inclusion in the review.</P>

<P>Search methods for identification of studies This review drew on the search strategy developed in consultation with search coordinators for the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group to avoid unnecessary duplication. We used Cochrane handbook search strategy for optimal sensitivity in identifying randomized clinical trials (Handbook 2000) (11a 15 Appendix B. Handbook 4.1 June 2000).<BR/>
<BR/>A systematic search without language restrictions was conducted to identify all relevant published and unpublished randomised controlled trials, with translation available if required.<BR/>
