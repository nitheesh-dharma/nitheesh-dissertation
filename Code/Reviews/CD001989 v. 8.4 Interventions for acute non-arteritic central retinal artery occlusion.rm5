<TITLE>Treatments for acute central retinal artery occlusion (blockage of the blood supply to the retina of the eye)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-29 11:30:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Central retinal artery occlusion occurs when the blood supply to the inner part of the retina (the light sensitive layer inside the eye) is suddenly stopped. If the blockage is removed in time, and the blood supply returns to the retina, full recovery is possible. However, if the blockage is prolonged the retina dies. Various methods have been tried in an attempt to remove the blockage including massaging the eye, lowering the pressure inside the eye and dissolving clots with drugs. Which of these methods is best for re-establishing the blood supply is not known and some of the treatments can be associated with serious adverse effects. This review did find two studies that suggested that the blood supply to the retina could be improved with the treatments they tested - although vision was not shown to be improved with either method in the study population. These were, however, small studies and did have potential flaws so more research is still needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:44:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) occurs as a sudden event when the blood supply to the inner part of the retina is blocked. The resulting ischaemia causes an almost immediate and profound loss of vision. The blood supply may be interrupted in several ways. The artery may be blocked by an embolus (a small piece of blood clot, cholesterol or calcium that has entered the bloodstream, usually from the wall of the carotid artery or sometimes the heart). Alternatively there may be a sudden narrowing of one of the vessels that supplies the central retinal artery or of the central artery itself (i.e. haemorrhage into an atheromatous plaque in the vessel wall). This review does not deal with CRAO associated with inflammation of the central retinal artery (arteritic CRAO) such as that seen secondary to temporal arteritis (a chronic condition involving inflammation of many arteries supplying blood to the head and neck and sometimes inflammation of the optic nerve).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The true incidence of CRAO in the population is unknown. <LINK REF="STD-Rumelt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rumelt 1999</LINK> estimated an incidence of acute (less than 48 hours) CRAO of 0.85/100,000 population/year at their institution. Over 75% of patients with CRAO have evidence of atherosclerosis and there is an association with diabetes and systemic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Ffytche-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ffytche 1974</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>There is debate about how long after the artery is blocked permanent visual loss occurs. If the blockage is removed in time, either spontaneously or with treatment, then full visual recovery is possible. Hayreh et al. have shown that the primate retina can tolerate up to 105 minutes of ischaemia but beyond this time irreparable damage occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Hayreh-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayreh 1980</LINK>). Extrapolation of this information to the human has led to the theory that treatment is only beneficial if commenced within eight hours of the occlusion. More recently, authors have reported beneficial effects from treatments given up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1999</LINK>) and Augsburger reported significant visual improvement after 48 hours of ischaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Augsburger-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Augsburger 1980</LINK>). However, studies suggest that shorter occlusion time results in better eventual visual recovery, usually as measured by Snellen visual acuity (<LINK REF="STD-Rumelt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rumelt 1999</LINK>). The devastating nature of the condition on the vision has led to a number of therapies being tried.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Waiting</I>
</B>
<BR/>Spontaneous resolution of the block (e.g. embolus moving on from the ophthalmic circulation) is reported by some authors to occur in less than 1% to 8% of cases (<LINK REF="STD-Rumelt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rumelt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1992</LINK>). Others have suggested up to 15% (<LINK REF="STD-Atebara-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atebara 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Dilation of artery</I>
</B>
<BR/>Various methods have been used to try to dilate the artery thereby allowing an increased blood flow and/or removal of the blockage. They have the potential disadvantage that they can also produce systemic vasodilatation and therefore reduce the systemic blood pressure. Vasodilators described in the literature include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (<LINK REF="STD-Rumelt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rumelt 1999</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>rebreathing of expired carbon dioxide (<LINK REF="REF-Harino-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harino 1995</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>breathing in a fixed mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide (called carbogen) (<LINK REF="STD-Atebara-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atebara 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deutsch-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deutsch 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmetterer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmetterer 1996</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Physical removal of obstruction</I>
</B>
<BR/>This is only likely to work when the cause of the obstruction is an embolus to the central retinal artery. The aim of treatment is to physically dislodge this embolus so that it passes through the ophthalmic circulation. Methods described include the patient massaging their own eye (this usually involves gently pressing on one side of the eye and then the other through closed lids) (<LINK REF="REF-Ffytche-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ffytche 1974</LINK>) or the practitioner massaging the patient's eye with fingers or a contact lens (the latter allows the retinal circulation to be viewed at the same time) (<LINK REF="STD-Rumelt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rumelt 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Increasing perfusion pressure by reduction of intraocular pressure</I>
</B>
<BR/>Ocular perfusion (blood flow through the eye) increases if intraocular pressure decreases. It has therefore been suggested that a sudden decrease in intraocular pressure may prompt an increase in perfusion pressure and a consequent reduction in retinal ischaemia. Methods of reducing intraocular pressure include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>anterior chamber paracentesis: this involves putting a small needle into the anterior chamber of the eye and withdrawing a small amount of aqueous (fluid in the front chamber of the eye) (<LINK REF="STD-Atebara-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atebara 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ffytche-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ffytche 1974</LINK>;);</LI>
<LI>intravenous acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) (<LINK REF="REF-Ffytche-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ffytche 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rassam-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rassam 1993</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>intravenous mannitol (an osmotic diuretic) (<LINK REF="STD-Rumelt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rumelt 1999</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>trabeculectomy: a surgical procedure that involves the creation of an aqueous fistula (channel) between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Thrombolysis (dissolving the clot)</I>
</B>
<BR/>Thrombolysis or fibrinolysis is a recognised treatment for acute myocardial infarctions and some types of stroke. The principle of lysis of the clot with subsequent restoration of the circulation has been extended to CRAO. The thrombolytic agent is administered intravenously and may be given locally or systemically. Local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) involves super-selective administration of the thrombolytic agent directly into the ophthalmic artery. A review and meta-analysis of the published data on this treatment has been prepared by <LINK REF="REF-Beatty-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beatty 2000</LINK>. Fibrinolytics used include urokinase (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 2005</LINK>) and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (<LINK REF="STD-Pettersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersen 2005</LINK>). Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has been used for some time in acute myocardial infarction and stroke - of all the thrombolytics studied this has the most data and is thought to be associated with less hazard and more benefit than other thrombolytics (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Antiplatelet therapy</I>
</B>
<BR/>It is known that in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (which has some analogy to CRAO), platelets become activated and this can worsen the ischaemia. Administration of antiplatelet drugs may reduce the progression of cerebral thrombosis and therefore the ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Holschermann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Holschermann 2005</LINK> used intravenous tirofiban - this is nonpeptide inhibitor of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor which has been used for acute ischaemic events in other organs. Although there are no formal studies identified, evidence from the stroke literature would suggest that all patients who have sustained a CRAO in one eye should be on long-term aspirin to reduce the risk in the fellow eye (<LINK REF="STD-Neubauer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neubauer 2000</LINK>). Clopidogrel is an alternative for patients in whom aspirin is contraindicated (<LINK REF="STD-Kattah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kattah 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Reducing red blood cell rigidity</I>
</B>
<BR/>The less deformable red blood cells are the harder it is for them to pass through the capillaries and the greater the tissue ischaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Iwafune-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Iwafune 1980</LINK>). Pentoxifylline has been shown to increase red blood cell deformability and has been used orally on patients with CRAO (<LINK REF="STD-Iwafune-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Iwafune 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kieswetter-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kieswetter 1983</LINK>). It has been used for other vascular conditions associated with reduced tissue perfusion including 'multi-infarct' dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Frampton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frampton 1995</LINK>). A Cochrane review of its use in acute ischaemic stroke did not find enough evidence to support its use (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Systemic steroids</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vascular endothelial oedema (swelling from excess fluid) has been suggested as a contributory factor to tissue damage following CRAO. Because of this, intravenous steroids have been suggested as a treatment option (<LINK REF="REF-Hausmann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hausmann 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP)</I>
</B>
<BR/>This non-invasive technique has been used in patients with ischaemic heart disease and reported to help relieve angina, improve exercise tolerance and improve cardiac perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Arora-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arora 1999</LINK>). The technique involves wrapping three sets of pneumatic cuffs around the lower extremities and monitoring the cardiac rhythm. The cuffs are inflated sequentially at the onset of diastole causing aortic counter pulsation and increased venous return (<LINK REF="REF-Pettersson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettersson 2006</LINK>). At the onset of systole the cuffs are released producing a decrease in systolic pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Pettersson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettersson 2006</LINK>). The results of these haemodynamic changes are increased coronary blood flow and a reduction in myocardial ischaemia.</P>
<P>Enhanced external counterpulsation has been suggested for use in other diseases with ischaemic problems e.g. hepatorenal syndrome, erectile dysfunction and restless leg syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Manchanda-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manchanda 2007</LINK>). It has also been suggested that it may have a role in the treatment of CRAO (<LINK REF="STD-Werner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Combinations of treatment</I>
</B>
<BR/>Some researchers (and probably most clinicians) have used combinations of the above. Kattah et al. used a combination of anterior chamber paracentesis (if the intraocular pressure in the affected eye was greater than 12 mmHg) and all patients were given intra-arterial rtPA (<LINK REF="STD-Kattah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kattah 2002</LINK>). This was followed by heparin and then warfarin for one month. The latter was replaced with aspirin or clopidogrel after one month. Arnold et al. used a combination of intraocular pressure lowering, intravenous urokinase and aspirin in their patients (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>There is no generally agreed standard treatment regimen for CRAO and this is exemplified by the number of different treatments that have been tried. Many of the treatment options have potential side effects, including serious haemorrhagic complications. This needs to be considered when assessing the value of interventions for a condition that sometimes resolves spontaneously.<BR/>It is not known how many hours after the event any potential treatment would be effective. Nor has there been any analysis comparing the cost of the treatment with the costs of visual loss.<BR/>Finally, it is important to be aware that experimental studies have shown that retinal damage may arise not only from the period of non-perfusion, but also from the cascade of oxidative damage which occurs with reperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1994</LINK>) i.e. there is the potential for a 'successful' treatment to make the ocular damage worse.</P>

</I>Updates to the searches conducted in September 2005 retrieved a further 305 titles and abstracts. Six papers were retrieved in full for further assessment. Four papers were rejected after reading the full paper (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drago-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Drago 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kattah 2002</LINK>). Two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Incandela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Incandela 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Werner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2004</LINK> were included in the review.</P>
<P>An updated search was done in June 2007 which yielded a further 203 reports of studies. The Trials Search Co-ordinator scanned the search results and removed any references which were not relevant to the scope of the review. Two papers were assessed for potential inclusion but were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Holschermann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Holschermann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pettersen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersen 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>An update search was run in September 2008 which yielded a further 110 reports of studies.The abstracts were scanned but no references were relevant to the scopic of the review. </P>

<P>Two studies were included in the review. See Table: <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for further details.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Incandela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Incandela 2002</LINK> reported a study that used oral pentoxifylline in patients with &#8216;sudden loss of vision&#8217;. Inclusion criteria was sudden loss of vision associated with thrombosis of the central retinal artery (i.e. CRAO) and patients were randomised to either pentoxifylline tablets (three 600 mg tablets daily) or placebo for four weeks. The endpoint measurement was both objective (change in central retinal artery flow velocity) and subjective - the patients were asked, using an analogue scale, how much they felt their vision had improved after treatment? There is no mention in the paper of how the analogue score was administered or what questions the patients were asked. The suggestion in the paper is that the lower the score the &#8216;better&#8217; the patients felt they were after treatment.</P>
<P>The paper mentions that during treatment patients &#8216;had to avoid smoking&#8217; though there is no mention of how many patients did this, or whether there was a difference between cases and controls in regard to smoking. From the description in the paper, patients seemed to be demographically similar. There is no mention of the number of patients who declined to be randomised for the study.</P>
<P>There is no mention in the paper of how the patients were allocated to the two treatment groups. An attempt was therefore made to contact the authors but, to date, there has been no response. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Werner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2004</LINK> reported a study where patients with acute (defined as within five days) CRAO or BRAO were given a short treatment of EECP. The diagnosis of arterial occlusion was made clinically. The study was prospective and randomised but non-masked and had 20 participants. There is no description in the paper of how the treatment was allocated. Ten patients were given haemodilution therapy plus two hours of EECP whilst the other 10 were given &#8216;regular&#8217; haemodilution only (the word &#8216;regular&#8217; is taken from the authors description). Haemodilution involved 500 ml of intravenous hydroxyethyl starch or if the patient had compromised cardiac function, 500 ml of electrolyte solution was used (this alternative was used in four of the EECP group and five of the &#8216;control&#8217; group). Fifteen patients were excluded from the study and their characteristics are described in the paper.</P>
<P>The outcome used was change in retinal perfusion measured by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry. This was initially measured during haemodilution, 30 minutes after EECP (or 30 minutes after when EECP would have been given - for the control group) and finally 48 hours later. Visual acuity was also measured after initial admission with the event and just before the final perfusion measurement (i.e. 48 hours after the end of treatment). The patients were also monitored for any adverse events during the treatments.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:12:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Both studies had a risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Incandela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Incandela 2002</LINK>: The study was small (10 participants) and in a single centre. The method of treatment allocation is not clear from the paper and the authors have not been contactable. A placebo was used but it is not possible to guage from the paper if the practitioners were masked - either those who dispensed the treatment or those who measured the central retinal artery flow velocity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Werner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2004</LINK>: Again the study was small with 20 participants and again was in a single centre. It is difficult to be sure of the method of treatment allocation - the main author was contacted and stated that 'lots' were drawn by a colleague to decide treatment allocation but could not give further detail. The therapy was non-masked but it is not known if the Doppler flow readings were taken by a masked observer. Further contamination comes from the fact that both EECP and non-EECP groups had haemodilution.<BR/>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:16:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Incandela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Incandela 2002</LINK>: There are a number of unanswered questions in relation to this study. Never the less this is the first study in patients with CRAO, that we identified, that attempted to randomly allocate treatment. There is no mention of the duration of visual loss of the patients enrolled in the study. The results presented showed an increase in retinal blood flow velocity and a decrease in analogue score in both case and controls. The authors report a greater increase in blood flow parameters in cases compared to controls and a &#8216;significant&#8217; difference in analogue score decrease with a greater decrease in the treated group. As both groups contained very small numbers it would be difficult to see how statistical significance could be reached. Surprisingly the paper does not give any details of changes in visual acuity in cases or controls. The paper does not discuss any adverse events associated with the treatment. There is no discussion of the economic aspects of the trial.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Werner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2004</LINK>: No adverse effects were reported in either group. The EECP group were found to have significantly greater retinal perfusion than the non-EECP group at the three hour post-treatment measurement. At the 48 hour measurement, both EECP and non-EECP groups showed increased perfusion from baseline but there was no longer a significant difference between the measurements of the two groups. There was no significant difference between the final visual acuity of the EECP group and non-EECP group. Again there was no discussion of the economic aspects of the trial.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:22:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:18:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Our previous version of this review concluded that no RCTs of treatment options for non-arteritic CRAO could be found. We suggested that there remained a number of treatments that are of unproven efficacy but may have a role in the treatment of the condition but that we could not make a recommendation of which may be the best. However, we now report two RCTs of treatments for CRAO which, although potentially flawed, suggest that oral pentoxifylline and/or EECP may have a role in treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Incandela-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Incandela 2002</LINK> indicated that the treated group had better retinal artery flow rates than the untreated group but how this translated into clinical benefit is harder to say (there seems little point in having better retinal artery blood flow if this does not lead to improved visual acuity). It is to the author&#8217;s credit that they attempted to look at the results from the patients perspective but odd that they did not publish the final visual acuities of cases and controls.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Werner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2004</LINK> also indicated a potentially improved retinal perfusion after EECP - but again this did not translate into better vision for the study patients. The study is complicated by the fact that both groups also underwent haemodilution and it is not, therefore, possible to know if this had a positive or negative effect on the EECP.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:22:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The limitations of the trials are discussed above. Amongst other problems both have small numbers and short follow-ups making it difficult to generalise their findings; even more so when both studies come from single centres. Neither trial gave precise information about allocation of treatment and this brings a further element of doubt to their findings. There are also issues about the standardisation criteria for entry to the trials i.e. how long after CRAO should treatment be started? The Werner trial was further complicated by the use of haemodilution in both groups.</P>
<P>We discussed in our previous version of this review the need for an RCT in CRAO treatment - to reduce the effect of other variables (e.g. smoking, diabetes, spontaneous resolution) and suggested some ideal characteristics of a trial. Amongst the suggestions we made was that the trial should be a multicentre study - to allow adequate recruitment and to improve generalisability. Robust (objective) entry criteria would be required as would measurable endpoints - including patient orientated outcomes. It would appear that such a trial is currently being undertaken in Europe. The European Assessment Group for Lysis in the Eye (EAGLE) is a prospective, randomised, multicentre study (<LINK REF="REF-Feltgen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feltgen 2006</LINK>). Inclusion criteria are patients with CRAO of less than 20 hours and a visual acuity of less than 0.32. After randomisation, patients are allocated to either conservative treatment or local intra-arterial thrombolysis using rtPA. Endpoint is visual acuity one month after treatment (compared with that at presentation). The study was started in 2002 and the latest paper (<LINK REF="REF-Feltgen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feltgen 2006</LINK>) reports that by April 2005 47 patients were recruited. The calculated sample size was 100 participants in each arm.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-10-23 09:27:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found two small RCTs; one that suggested a positive effect for oral pentoxifylline in the treatment of non-arteritic CRAO and the other for EECP (combined with haemodilution). The small size of the studies, potential for bias and the lack of data on final vision means that we do not have convincing evidence at present to support the routine use of pentoxifylline or of EECP in patients with CRAO. However in the absence of other proven therapies, the relative apparent safety of both these treatment modalities would lead us to suggest that if treatment is deemed necessary then either or both would be justified. No treatment is without its potential hazards and it is important that the practitioner allows the patient to balance the risks of these interventions with the possibilty of a positive clinical effect. Results from the EAGLE study will, we hope, allow us to determine if there is a role for more invasive, thrombolysis therapies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:25:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This review identified one trial that suggested a positive effect for oral pentoxifylline and one that suggested a role for EECP (combined with haemodilution). Both studies did, however, appear to have limitations that make generalisation difficult. There is a large RCT of intra-arterial thrombolysis currently underway and the results are potentially interesting. We would also suggest that a large RCT was devised using oral pentoxifylline in one arm and EECP in another versus either placebo or intra-arterial thrombolysis (depending upon the results of the EAGLE trial). If possible this study should be designed using the same entry criteria and outcomes measures as the EAGLE trial to allow future meta-analysis.</P>
