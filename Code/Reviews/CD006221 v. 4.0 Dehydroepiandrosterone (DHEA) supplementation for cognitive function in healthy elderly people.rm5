<DESCRIPTION>
<P>A new update search was performed on 18 March 2008. Three double-blind trials, with randomized parallel placebo-controlled design, were included: two long-term trials involved elderly men and women; and another short-term trial lasting for 12 weeks recruited only elderly women.</P>
<P>There is no beneficial effect of DHEA supplementation on cognitive function of older people. DHEA was well tolerated, but the long-term safety of low and high doses of DHEA for older people is still uncertain. Further large double-blind, randomized parallel-group placebo-controlled trials are needed.</P>

<P>The adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphated ester (DHEAS) are together the most abundant of steroid hormones in both sexes. Blood levels are high in young adults and decrease with advancing age. There is some epidemiological evidence that relatively high serum DHEAS levels in males may protect against heart disease and be associated with increased longevity. In the USA there is growing public enthusiasm for DHEA supplementation as a means of retarding ageing and age-associated cognitive impairment but there is very little evidence from controlled trials. In two trials DHEA was associated with a deleterious effect on visual memory after a psychosocial stressor and quality of life measures, but there is inconsistent systematic evidence of adverse effects from DHEA. Longer-term randomized placebo controlled trials are needed for low and high doses. </P>

<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 18 March 2008 using the terms: dhea*, prasterone, dehydroepiandrosterone*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources.</P>
<P>Relevant journals, personal communications and conference abstracts were searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of DHEA/S on cognition in older adults.</P>

<P>All randomized placebo-controlled trials enrolling people aged over 50 without dementia and to whom DHEA in any dosage was administered for more than one day were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data for the specified outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers (JGE and RM) and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved. No data pooling was undertaken owing to the lack of availability of the relevant statistics.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-12-19 15:52:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Five studies provided results from adequate parallel-group data. Barnhart 1999 and Dayal 2006 enrolled perimenopausal women with complaints of decreased well being and, using three cognitive measures, found no significant effect of DHEA compared with placebo at 3 months. Wolf 1998b enrolled 75 healthy volunteers (37 women and 38 men aged 59-81) in a study of the effect of DHEA supplements on cognitive impairment induced by stress; after two weeks of treatment, placebo group performance deteriorated significantly on a test of selective attention following a psychosocial stressor (p&lt;0.05), while deterioration was not evident in the DHEA group (p=0.85). However, when compared with placebo, DHEA was associated with significant impairment on a visual memory recall test (p&lt;0.01) following the stressor. No significant effects were found on a third cognitive task. Effects were not found on tasks when administered in the absence of a stressor. van Niekerk 2001 found no effect on cognitive function in 46 men aged 62-76 from three months of DHEA supplementation. Nair 2006, enrolled 57 women and 87 men with low level of sulphated DHEA in a 24-month study, no significant changes in quality of life measures for either sex were found. In Von Muhlen 2008 DHEA for one year showed no benefit on cognition performance in 225 healthy older people. Reduced performance in a visual memory recall test observed in one trial and a significant drop-out rate in favour of placebo emerged in another trial.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-30 11:37:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>What little evidence there is from controlled trials does not support a beneficial effect of DHEA supplementation on cognitive function of non-demented middle-aged or elderly people. There is inconsistent evidence from the controlled trials about adverse effects of DHEA.</P>
<P>In view of growing public enthusiasm for DHEA supplementation, particularly in the USA, and the theoretical possibility of long-term neuroprotective effects of DHEA there is a need for further high quality trials in which the duration of DHEA treatment is longer than one year, and the number of participants is large enough to provide adequate statistical power. Cognitive outcomes should be assessed in all trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-12-19 15:57:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphated ester (DHEAS) are together the most abundant steroid hormones in both sexes. They occur in high blood levels in young adults and decrease with advancing age (<LINK REF="REF-Guazzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guazzo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orentreich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orentreich 1992</LINK>). DHEA/S are neurosteroids, i.e. they can be synthesized in neurons and glial cells as well as in the adrenal glands (<LINK REF="REF-Baulieu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baulieu 1998</LINK>). They increase the effects of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate (<LINK REF="REF-Debonnel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Debonnel 1996</LINK>), and decrease the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA (<LINK REF="REF-Majewska-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majewska 1995</LINK>). DHEA may also act as a neuroprotective agent (<LINK REF="REF-Kimonides-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimonides 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimonides-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimonides 1999</LINK>) and boost the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Casson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casson 1993</LINK>). There is some clinical and experimental evidence that administration of DHEA stimulates the activity of natural killer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Casson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casson 1993</LINK>) and might be effective in the treatment of immunological disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ebeling-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebeling 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Vollenhoven-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Vollenhoven 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the immunological and neural effects of DHEA/S may be related to its powerful antiglucocorticoid action (<LINK REF="REF-Blauer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimonides-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimonides 1999</LINK>). High levels of cortisol cause damage to neurones, particularly in the hippocampus (<LINK REF="REF-Kimonides-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimonides 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lupien-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lupien 1998</LINK>), and suppress immune function. In young adults, the adverse effects of cortisol (e.g., during stress or trauma) may be opposed by the high levels of DHEA/S. Older adults may be rendered more vulnerable to the damaging effects of cortisol (<LINK REF="REF-Herbert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 1997</LINK>) as a result of their low levels of DHEA/S. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Morales-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 1994</LINK>) supplements of DHEA produced an increase in IGF-1, a marker of growth hormone activity, and this might also have beneficial effects on age-associated physiological changes.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Since DHEA/S levels decrease with age it has been postulated that various age-associated changes might be due to DHEA/S deficiency and reversible or preventable by supplements. A community-based cohort study, in 940 participants followed for 27 years, indicated that DHEA/S level may be a predictor of longevity in men, independent of age, blood pressure, and plasma glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Enomoto-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enomoto 2008</LINK>). There is also some epidemiological evidence which suggests that the DHEA/S concentration is independently and inversely related to death from any cause and death from cardiovascular disease in men over age 50 (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett-Connor 1986</LINK>). Some studies showed lower than normal levels of DHEA/S in the serum of patients diagnosed with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Hillen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nasman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sunderland-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderland 1989</LINK>), while others reported no difference (<LINK REF="REF-Berr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1992</LINK>). A prospective observational study of 394 women aged 65 and over and followed for four to six years showed no relation between serum DHEAS levels and cognitive performance or decline (<LINK REF="REF-Yaffe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaffe 1998</LINK>). In contrast, in a cross-sectional study of 295 women, aged<SUP> </SUP>21-77 years, higher endogenous DHEAS levels were independently<SUP> </SUP>and favourably associated with better executive function, concentration,<SUP> </SUP>and working memory (
<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>DHEA taken by mouth is absorbed into the blood stream. Supplements are sold in large quantities in health food stores, particularly in the USA, as a general anti-ageing agent claimed to improve well being as well as reducing the risk of dementia and having a beneficial effect on cognitive function. The US supplement market in 2000 was estimated at US$16·7 billion, as reported in the Financial Times newspaper (<LINK REF="REF-Maughan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maughan 2004 </LINK>); an important factor behind this growth was the availability of DHEA over-the-counter. Since DHEA is biotransformable into other hormones, including androgens and oestrogens, its effects might be indirect, complex, and individually variable. <LINK REF="STD-Hirshman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hirshman 2004</LINK>, for example, found evidence that following DHEA supplements, oestrogen levels were positively and androgen levels negatively associated with measures of recognition memory but the associations were reversed in perceptual identification tests. DHEA/S is often described as a "weak androgen" but one of its physiological effects in older men is to increase oestrogen levels (<LINK REF="REF-Arlt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arlt 1999</LINK>). Dosage recommendations vary; most studies used 50 to 100 mg/day of DHEA, but some have<SUP> </SUP>used doses up to 1600 mg/day, and a dose of 50 mg/day has been shown to increase the serum level of older people to that of young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Arlt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arlt 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The giving of DHEA is sometimes referred to as "treatment" or "replacement", but since the aim is to increase body levels of a natural chemical that is already present, "supplementation" is the most correct term.</P>
<P>In view of the possibility of beneficial effects of DHEA on the cognitive function of ageing adults, we have reviewed the results of relevant studies. This review is concerned with older people not suffering from dementia or depression. </P>

<P>Irrelevant citations were discarded by reviewers on the basis of the title of a publication or its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that the article could be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment. The reviewers independently selected the trials for inclusion in this review from the culled citation list.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial, using ratings described in the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>):</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial design</HEADING>
<P>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by telephone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a "list" or "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or "sealed envelopes"; (iii) stating the study as "randomized" without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</P>
<P>Trials were included if they conformed to categories A or B; those falling into category C were excluded.</P>
<P>Other aspects of trial design were not assessed by a scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of participants lost to follow-up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Trials were included if outcome assessments included cognitive functions as measured by psychometric tests of recognised reliability and validity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were independently extracted by two reviewers (JGE and RM) and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved.</P>
<P>For continuous variables, the main outcomes of interest are the final assessment and the change from baseline at final assessment.</P>
<P>In a generic inverse variance method the 95% confidence interval or an exact P-value was used to estimate the treatment effect and Standard Error between the two groups in the study. </P>
<P>Studies may include a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. The data from these titration periods were not used to assess safety or efficacy since patients are not usually randomized, nor are treatment or dose allocation concealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For studies using a parallel-groups design, differences from baseline are compared between the treatment and placebo groups. In studies using a cross-over design, data from the first treatment period only are used where such data are available. The half life of DHEA/S is short, and wash-out periods can reduce carry-over effects. With healthy participants the problem of shifting baselines associated with progressive disorders such as dementia is also less. However, study designs in which participants experience both treatment and placebo, and, in the context of informed consent, know that what they are allocated to in the second phase of a study will be the opposite of what they have already experienced in the first may introduce complex problems from positive and negative placebo effects. Although it might be reasonable to pool biochemical or some types of physiological data from the first and second phases of a cross-over study, it is not safe to do the same for measures of cognitive function or mood.</P>

<P>There have been several studies of the effect of DHEA on age-associated phenomena such as bone loss (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2002</LINK>) and sarcopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Percheron-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Percheron 2003</LINK>) and in specific diseases such as fibromyalgia and primary Sjogren syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Finckh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Finckh 2005</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Hartkamp-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hartkamp 2008</LINK> ), and in people with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Brignardello-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Brignardello 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>A cross-over study of 30 men and women aged 42 to 70 by <LINK REF="STD-Morales-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 1994</LINK> included self-reported libido and well being in outcome measures but no specific assessment of cognitive function.</P>
<P>Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hirshman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hirshman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirshman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hirshman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alhaj-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Alhaj 2006</LINK> ) included measures of cognitive function but used cross-over designs without separate publication of first-phase data. <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1997a</LINK> enrolled 40 healthy men and women of mean age 69, and gave DHEA 50 mg or placebo daily for two weeks. Changes in blood levels of DHEA/S were observed but there were no effects on memory as measured by tests of concentration, visual short- and long-term memory, the Stroop test, digit span, psychometric speed, or auditory verbal learning. <LINK REF="STD-Hirshman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hirshman 2003</LINK> claimed from a study of 30 postmenopausal women that DHEA was associated with enhanced memory recognition and fewer false positive recognitions, but this was not seen under all conditions of test presentation. <LINK REF="STD-Hirshman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hirshman 2004</LINK> carried out a within-subject cross-over study of six postmenopausal women and claimed that oestrogenic metabolites of DHEA had positive effect and androgens a negative effect on visual memory. A reverse pattern was seen with perceptual identification. These results should perhaps be seen as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1998a</LINK> studied 17 healthy elderly men aged 59-81 given DHEA or placebo for two weeks. No effects on visual, spatial, or semantic memory were observed. In <LINK REF="STD-Alhaj-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Alhaj 2006</LINK> 24 healthy young men were treated with a seven-day course of oral DHEA (150 mg/day). Subjective mood and memory were measured using visual analogue scales (VASs). DHEA treatment improved memory recollection and mood, and decreased trough cortisol levels.</P>
<P>Authors of these five studies are being contacted to seek first-phase data suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Villareal-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villareal 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2005</LINK>), DHEA supplementation was confounded with physical exercise training, and no measures of cognition were included.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>Six studies provided usable observations based on reliable psychometric tests of memory or other cognitive functions:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1998b</LINK> tested the hypothesis that an antiglucocorticoid action of DHEA would result in an enhanced declarative memory performance after stress-exposure. (Declarative memory is for facts, as distinct from procedural memory which underpins learnt skills). Seventy-five men and women aged 59 to 81, without serious memory complaints and with normal scores on a depression index, took part in the study comparing two weeks of DHEA 50 mg/day with two weeks of placebo. At the end of the two weeks, tests of visual and verbal memory, selective-attention memory and spatial memory were administered before and after an episode of social stress (making a speech and performing mental arithmetic in front of an audience). Biochemical variables were also measured. This study was concerned with possible modulation by DHEA reactions to psychological stress, and is therefore relevant to the cognitive performance of healthy older individuals for whom such stresses are common in daily life.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnhart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barnhart 1999</LINK> enrolled 66 perimenopausal women (60 completers) aged 45 to 55 "with symptoms of fatigue, lack of energy, anxiety, tension, irritability, depression, insomnia, forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, decreased libido, or global sense of reduced wellbeing". Exclusion criteria included a current diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder or the taking of antidepressant medication. The study compared the effects of three months of DHEA 50 mg/day with three months of placebo. Main outcome measures were of health-related quality of life, mood, and depression, but memory and some other aspects of cognitive function were assessed using standardized tests. Given the inter-relationships between DHEA/S and other steroid hormones, the mechanism of any effect of DHEA/S in women with perimenopausal symptoms might differ from that in men or in women of other ages or without perimenopausal symptoms. Results could not therefore be regarded as necessarily extrapolatable to middle-aged and older people in general.</P>
<P>Limited information was available from a third study reported by <LINK REF="STD-van-Niekerk-2001" TYPE="STUDY">van Niekerk 2001</LINK>. Forty-six male volunteers aged 60 to 80 were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized cross-over study aimed primarily at correlating physiological levels of circulating DHEA with measures of well-being, mood and cognition. Exclusion criteria included current psychiatric disorder, use of psychotropic medication, or history of cardiovascular or neurological disorder. The investigators found significant period effects in cognitive outcomes and a significant statistical interaction between treatment effect and period. In order to avoid consequent bias in assessing treatment effects they reported on a separate analysis of the first-phase data only, and no significant treatment effects of DHEA were observed. Detailed data suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis were not presented. The statistical interactions in this study exemplify the possible bias in studies with a cross-over design.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dayal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dayal 2005</LINK> enrolled 50 postmenopausal women, aged 44-70 years, who were randomized for a 12-week trial into four treatment groups: DHEA 50 mg/day; conjugated equine oestrogen (CEE) 0.65 mg/day; DHEA 50 mg plus CEE 0.65 mg daily; and placebo. Main outcome measures of lower extremity muscle (calf) mass, muscle function, serum hormone and lipid levels, and quality of life (QOL) were obtained at baseline and after treatment. Hormone levels included measures of DHEA, cortisol, total testosterone, total oestrogen, androstenedione,and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDA, LDL, LP, apoA, and apoB were also measured.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nair-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2006</LINK> report a two-year trial involving 87 men and 57 women aged 60 and over. Eligibility criteria for men included low levels of bioavailable testosterone (&lt; 3.6 nmol/L) plus a sulphated DHEA level less than 4.3 mcmol/L; eligibilty for women included a sulphated DHEA level below 2.6 mcmol/L. The male participants were randomized between three treatment groups: DHEA tablet (75 mg/day) plus a transdermal placebo patch; placebo tablet and a transdermal testosterone patch (5 mg/day); or a placebo tablet and a placebo transdermal patch. Women received DHEA (50 mg/day) or a placebo tablet. Primary outcomes measures were physical performance, peak aerobic capacity, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), plasma insulin and glucose. Other assessments were body weight, the proportion of body fat, insulin-sensitivity index, levels of various hormones and alkaline phosphate level, haemoglobin, quality of life and monitoring for adverse events.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-von-Muhlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">von Muhlen 2007</LINK>, the effect of 50 mg/day DHEA was studied in a community setting trial involving 225 participants aged 55 to 85 years (110 men and 115 women) over one year. Outcome measures included bone mineral density and metabolism, body composition, muscle strength, immune function, cardiovascular risk factors, steroid hormone levels, bone markers, cytokines, the IGF-1IGF binding protein system, changes in mood and well being. Cognitive function and sexuality were also assessed.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dayal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dayal 2005</LINK> employed the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) as a tool to examine well being and quality of life. The WHQ seeks details of minor psychological and somatic symptoms experienced by pre- and post-menopausal women. Symptoms are clustered in nine domains to assess: somatic symptoms, depressed mood, cognitive difficulties, anxiety/fear, sexual functioning, vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, menstrual symptoms, and self-perceived attractiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Wiklund-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiklund 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2006</LINK> the Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ) was used to evaluate quality of life. The HSQ adds three questions to the medical outcomes Study 36-item Short General Form Survey (SF-36) to provide a further assessment of physical and mental health constructs. The SF-36 is an assessment for both physical and psychological facets of health containing 36 multiple-choice questions requiring less than 10 minutes to complete. It provides a global health score and separate scores for: physical health, role performance, emotional, social and mental health, bodily pain, vitality and general health perceptions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-von-Muhlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">von Muhlen 2007</LINK> used the following standardized batteries to measure changes in cognitive function:</P>
<P>Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (3MS) (<LINK REF="REF-Teng-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 1987</LINK>). This is a general cognitive battery with components for concentration, language, praxis, orientation, and immediate and delayed memory. The test takes10-15 minutes and scoring ranges from 0-100.</P>
<P>The Trail Making Test Part B (<LINK REF="REF-Fromm_x002d_Auch1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fromm-Auch1983</LINK>) is a measure of speed mental operation, attention, visual scanning, visual sequential abilities, and mental flexibility. A maximum of 300 seconds is allowed. Scoring depends on the time needed to complete the task, with higher scores indicating poorer performance.</P>
<P>Verbal Fluency (<LINK REF="REF-Borkowski-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkowski 1967</LINK>) is a test of semantic memory, verbal production and language. The test requires two minutes for completion and test measures the number of different animals named in one minute. Scores depend on level of education.</P>
<P>The Modified Boston Naming Test (<LINK REF="REF-Kapalan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapalan 1982</LINK>) is a 15-item test of language function based on visual confrontation naming. The task lasts three minutes and scoring is based on the number of correct answers. Maximum score is 15 with higher scores indicating better performance.</P>
<P>Word List Memory (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1989</LINK>) tests ability to remember newly learned information. Ten common words are presented in printed form and the task is to recall as many as possible. Total administration time is four minutes and the maximum score is 30.</P>
<P>Word List Recall (<LINK REF="REF-Welsh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welsh 1994</LINK>) tests memory from the Word List Memory test after a 30-minutes delay. A maximum time of 90 seconds is allowed and scores are the sum of words correctly recalled from the three trials. The maximum score is 10.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-von-Muhlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">von Muhlen 2007</LINK> three instruments were applied to assess changes in quality of life.</P>
<P>For general life satisfaction assessment two standardised measures were used:</P>
<P>The Life Satisfaction Index-Z (LSI-Z) (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1969</LINK>) consists of 13 statements for which respondents are asked to indicate if they agree, disagree, or do not know. Two points are given for satisfaction response, 1 point for do not know, and 0 for dissatisfaction. Several items were reverse scored, and scores for all items were summed to yield a general measure of life satisfaction. Scoring range from 0 to 26, with higher scores indicating better life satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (<LINK REF="REF-Diener-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diener 1985</LINK>) consists of five items for which respondents rate the extent to their agreement from strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (7 points). Overall scores range from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating better life satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is a reliable and well-validated questionnaire addressing both physical and psychological facets of health. It comprises 36 multiple-choice questions, is easy to administer and takes less than 10 minutes to complete. It provides both a global health status score and a separate score for each of eight domains: physical functioning, role functioning (physical), role functioning (emotional), social functioning, mental health, bodily pain, vitality, and general health perceptions (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1992</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-12-19 16:40:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Data for intention-to-treat analysis were not available for either of the two studies newly eligible for inclusion, but <LINK REF="STD-Barnhart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barnhart 1999</LINK> reported that an intention-to-treat analysis of their study produced similar findings to those of the published completers' analysis.</P>
<P>There were few significant findings.</P>
<P>In an analysis of variance, <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1998b</LINK> found that placebo group performance deteriorated significantly on a test of selective attention following the psychosocial stressor (P &lt; 0.05), while deterioration was not evident in the DHEA group (P = 0.85). However, when compared with placebo, DHEA was associated with a significant impairment on a visual memory test (P &lt; 0.01) following the stressor. No significant effect was found on a third cognitive task. Effects were not found on tasks when administered in the absence of a stressor. There is no obvious unifying interpretation of these results and they may simply reflect the play of chance. No data were extractable for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barnhart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barnhart 1999</LINK>, studying women with a variety of perimenopausal symptoms, employed three cognitive measures and found no significant effect of DHEA on any of them. Data have been extracted in the Table of comparisons. For the quality of life using SKQOL no significant difference between DHEA 50 mg/day for 12 weeks over placebo; WMD -3.20 (95%CI -34.83 to 28.43, P=0.84)</P>
<P>In all the studies DHEA replacement was well tolerated and apart from the effect on post-stressor visual memory observed by <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1998b</LINK>, there were no significant adverse effects.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Dayal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dayal 2005</LINK>, results revealed no significant difference of DHEA 50 mg/day at week 12 over placebo on measures of cognition or quality of life of postmenopausal women. The data were summarized as percentage change from baseline: for cognition (DHEA 9.00 vs -8.00 placebo); for quality of life (DHEA -1.00 vs -6.00 placebo).</P>
<P>For both elderly men and women, the 24-month daily supplementation with DHEA in <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2006</LINK> was associated with no significant changes in physical or mental component scales of the HSQ. For elderly women (50 mg/day), quality of life (mental component) showed WMD 0.77 (95% CI -2.56 to 4.10, P = 0.61) and for physical components WMD was 0.56 (95% CI -2.51 to 3.63, P = 0.72).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-12-19 16:42:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Despite the growing popularity of DHEA supplementation among older adults, there is very little empirical evidence for beneficial effects. There is also evidence that any effects of DHEA might be mediated by other hormones into which the exogenous DHEA is transformed; these effects might therefore vary between individuals, with age, between sexes, and according to emotional status of stress or arousal. It has also been suggested that oestrogenic and androgenic derivatives of DHEA might have different effects on different cognitive functions (<LINK REF="STD-Hirshman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hirshman 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although data from only five trials have been included in this review, it is noteworthy that of the four non-included cross-over trials two did not show any effect of DHEA on cognitive function and no consistent effects were observed in the others. The few significant effects reported by <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1998b</LINK> could have arisen by chance in the multiple comparisons undertaken in the analysis. Longer-term supplementation with DHEA was evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2006</LINK> with administration of two doses (50 mg/day and 75 mg/day) over two years, and by <LINK REF="STD-von-Muhlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">von Muhlen 2007</LINK> giving 50 mg/day DHEA for one year. One of the entry criteria for <LINK REF="STD-Nair-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 2006</LINK> was low baseline DHEA levels, this criterion was not applied in <LINK REF="STD-von-Muhlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">von Muhlen 2007</LINK> in order to enrol a more generally representative sample of older people. Results for men and women were analysed separately and revealed no evidence that either dosage of DEHA (50 mg/day, 75 mg/day) improved cognitive function or quality of life, physical or mental. This trial involved rather small sample sizes. The other two studies also involved small numbers of participants and the duration of supplementation was brief at 12 weeks. Moreover, all the cognitive tests used in these studies had been developed to evaluate the function of impaired individuals as opposed to cognitively intact individuals, also all these tests had the floor and ceiling effect. If DHEA has neuroprotective effects, these may take longer than three months to become evident. The DHEA safety profile was inconsistent for low dosage of DHEA in two trials; longer-term studies are needed to assess risks and benefits from low and high doses.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-12-19 16:42:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-09-22 14:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>What little evidence there is from controlled trials does not support a beneficial effect of DHEA supplementation on cognitive function of normal middle-aged or elderly people. Evidence from controlled trials on adverse effects of DHEA is inconsistent.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-19 16:42:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Further research into the effects of DHEA supplements on cognitive function of middle-aged and elderly people is desirable for two reasons:</P>
<P>1. It is a reasonable hypothesis that DHEA supplements might have beneficial effects on some age-associated changes including, possibly, age-associated memory impairment (AAMI).</P>
<P>2. DHEA is widely sold and promoted as a health food supplement; it is in the public interest that its beneficial and adverse effects should be adequately documented.</P>
<P>Future studies need to incorporate the following features:</P>
<P>1. Trials should be of parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled design, with clear prior specification of outcome measures of interest.</P>
<P>2.Subgroup analysis based on age, gender and DHEA levels should be considered in order to identify groups which might benefit from DHEA supplementation.</P>
<P>3. Treatment periods should be at least 12 months.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Tests of cognitive function used should have good psychometric properties (avoiding floor and ceiling effects and providing a good range of scores) and be sensitive to change.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Sample sizes should be large enough to provide adequate power and to allow for statistical correction for multiple outcome comparisons.<BR/>
