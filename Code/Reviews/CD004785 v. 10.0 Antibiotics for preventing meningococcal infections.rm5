<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-23 08:48:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meningococcal disease is a contagious bacterial disease caused by the bacteria <I>Neisseria meningitidis </I>(<I>N.meningitidis</I>) with high fatality rates: up to 15% for infection of the central nervous system (meningitis) and up to 50% to 60% among patients with blood stream infection and shock; up to 15% of survivors are left with severe neurological deficits. People who have had close contact with someone who has a meningococcal infection and populations with known high carriage rates are offered antibiotics in order to eradicate the bacteria and thus prevent disease.</P>
<P>Data from 24 studies, most of high quality, including 6885 participants found that rifampin (also known as rifampicin), ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and penicillin are effective agents for eradicating carriage of <I>N. meningitidis</I>. However, the use of rifampin may have a disadvantage as development of resistance to the antibiotic has been noted following treatment. Mild adverse events are associated with the different antibiotics used. Disease prevention could not be evaluated directly in this review as only data for eradication of the bacteria were available. Different follow-up periods were reported in the studies. Evidence in this review is current as of June 2013.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently appraised the quality and extracted data from the included trials. We analysed dichotomous data by calculating the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each trial.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-18 18:20:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No new trials were found for inclusion in this update. We included 24 studies; 19 including 2531 randomised participants and five including 4354 cluster-randomised participants. There were no cases of meningococcal disease during follow-up in the trials, thus effectiveness regarding prevention of future disease cannot be directly assessed.</P>
<P>Mortality that was reported in one study was not related to meningococcal disease or treatment. Ciprofloxacin (RR 0.04; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.12), rifampin (rifampicin) (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.24), minocycline (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.37) and penicillin (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.94) proved effective at eradicating <I>N. meningitidis</I> one week after treatment when compared with placebo. Rifampin (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.29), ciprofloxacin (RR 0.03; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42) and penicillin (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.79) still proved effective at one to two weeks. Rifampin was effective compared to placebo up to four weeks after treatment but resistant isolates were seen following prophylactic treatment. No trials evaluated ceftriaxone against placebo but rifampin was less effective than ceftriaxone after one to two weeks of follow-up (RR 5.93; 95% CI 1.22 to 28.68). Mild adverse events associated with treatment were observed.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-19 15:23:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using rifampin during an outbreak may lead to the circulation of resistant isolates. Use of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone or penicillin should be considered. All four agents were effective for up to two weeks follow-up, though more trials comparing the effectiveness of these agents for eradicating <I>N. meningitidis</I> would provide important insights.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-18 18:32:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meningococcal disease is a contagious bacterial disease caused by <I>Neisseria meningitidis </I>(<I>N. meningitidis</I>). It is spread by person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets. <I>N. meningitidis </I>inhabits the mucosal membrane of the nose and throat where it usually causes no harm. Carriage rates vary from 10% among randomly sampled populations to 95% during epidemics. These carriers are crucial to the spread of the disease as most cases are acquired through exposure to asymptomatic carriers (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003a</LINK>). The onset of symptoms of meningococcal disease is sudden and death can follow within hours. Case-fatality rates from invasive meningococcal disease are 10% to 15%, rising as high as 50% to 60% among patients with meningococcaemia (blood stream infection) and shock. For survivors, there are persistent neurological defects including hearing loss, speech disorders, loss of limbs, mental retardation and paralysis in as many as 10% to 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meningococcal disease occurs sporadically and in small clusters throughout the world. It accounts for a variable proportion of endemic bacterial meningitis with seasonal variations. In temperate regions the number of cases increases in winter and spring. Serogroups B and C together account for the large majority of cases in Europe, the Americas and Australasia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Serogroup B meningococcal disease caused 68% of cases reported in Europe between 1993 and 1996 and has also caused outbreaks in other developed countries, with attack rates of 5 to 50 cases per 100,000 persons (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 2001</LINK>). Several local outbreaks due to serogroup C <I>N. meningitidis</I> have also been reported in Canada and the USA (1992 to 1993) and in Spain (1995 to 1997). In New Zealand, meningococcal disease activity has increased in the past 10 years and an average of 500 cases occur every year. Most of these cases are due to serogroup B, while serogroup A is usually the cause of meningococcal disease in Asia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the African 'meningitis belt' that extends from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal in the west, serogroup A meningococcal disease poses a recurrent threat to public health and rates of meningococcal disease are several times higher than in industrialised countries. The reported mortality is usually around 10%, a rate similar to that in industrialised countries, but true mortality is probably much higher. Attack rates can be as high as 100 to 800 cases per 100,000 and individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100,000. In 1996, the largest outbreak ever reported occurred in the meningitis belt. The total number of cases was over 250,000 with 25,000 reported deaths. Between 1996 and 2002, 223,000 new cases of meningococcal disease were reported to the World Health Organization. The countries most affected were Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia and Niger. In 2002, the outbreaks occurring in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Niger accounted for about 65% of the total cases reported in the African continent. In Burkina Faso alone, 13,000 cases caused by serogroup W135 were reported and 1500 deaths recorded. Furthermore, the meningitis belt appears to be extending further south. In 2002 the Great Lakes region was affected by outbreaks in villages and refugee camps, which caused more than 2200 cases and 200 deaths.</P>
<P>In addition, there is increasing evidence of serogroup W135 being associated with other outbreaks of considerable size. In 2000 and 2001 several hundred pilgrims attending the Hajj in Saudi Arabia were infected with <I>N. meningitidis</I> W135. Outside Africa only Mongolia has reported a large epidemic in recent years (1994 to 1995) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relative frequency of disease caused by <I>N. meningitidis</I> has increased in recent years due to the widespread use of an effective vaccine for <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>)<I> </I>B<I> </I>and a vaccine for <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>). The successful use of these vaccines has left <I>N. meningitidis</I> as the most common cause of bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Conterno-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conterno 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-14 05:54:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of chemoprophylaxis is to reduce the risk of invasive disease by eradicating carriage. Individuals in close contact with cases of meningococcal disease are at increased risk of developing disease. The highest documented relative and absolute risk is for people living in the same household as a case of meningococcal disease, during the first seven days. If prophylaxis is not given, the absolute risk is about 1 in 300 (<LINK REF="REF-PHLS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHLS 2002</LINK>), with the risk of contracting the disease increased by a factor of 400 to 800 (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 2001</LINK>). Prophylaxis is also considered in populations with known high carriage rates, such as military personnel. The carriers are at increased risk of contracting the disease themselves and may pose a risk of infection to others.</P>
<P>Post-exposure immunisation with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine can effectively decrease secondary cases of disease. However, given that the vaccine is not protective for at least 10 days after administration and no effective vaccine is currently available against serogroup B, <I>N. meningitidis</I> chemoprophylaxis remains an important component in limiting disease spread (<LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rifampin (rifampicin) given orally twice daily for two days in a 10 mg/kg dose (600 mg maximum) remains the drug of choice for meningococcal prophylaxis of high-risk groups. Frequent side effects, contraindications during pregnancy and unavailability of a convenient suspension for paediatric usage limit the overall utility of rifampin. Rapid development of rifampin resistance by meningococcal isolates has also been indicated. Thus other systemic antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of <I>N. meningitidis</I>, including ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, are also used as prophylactic agents. However, quinolones are not approved for routine paediatric usage and ceftriaxone requires parenteral administration (<LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included 24 trials, performed between the years 1966 to 2000, in the review (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). Six trials included household contacts of <I>N. meningitidis</I> cases. Sixteen studies were eradication trials conducted on healthy individuals. Of these studies one included children exclusively, four included students, seven included army recruits, three included volunteers and in one study the population was unspecified. An additional eradication trial of <I>N. meningitidis</I> included patients with extragenital gonorrhoea and another included patients with culture or smear-positive tests for anogenital gonorrhoea or confirmed recent exposure to gonorrhoea. Children were included in five trials. In all, only six trials explicitly reported the trial population age (range or mean).</P>
<P>Carrier rates ranged from 6.7% to 72% (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) with a median of 22%.</P>
<P>In 10 trials, allocation generation was performed before carrier status was determined (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).

Eleven studies compared different antibiotic drugs and two studies included more than two study arms, one of which was given placebo.</P>
<P>Pre-treatment susceptibility of meningococci to antibiotics was reported in 21 trials. All isolates were susceptible to the antibiotics tested in these trials except for a single study comparing sulphadimidine to placebo, in which nine of 93 strains were resistant to sulphadimidine (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1980</LINK>).

In the study with the longest follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1974</LINK>), at day 130 there were no positive cultures in the rifampin group (n = 7) while in the control group two of four individuals had a positive culture for <I>N. meningitidis</I>. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dowd-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Dowd 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK>) compared penicillin to placebo after three to four weeks of follow-up.

<P>In a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK>) comparing minocycline and rifampin after five weeks, no significant difference was seen between the two drugs' effectiveness for eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage of <I>N. meningitidis</I> (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.97) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials were included in this review but not in the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1980</LINK> found that rifampin was more effective at eradicating carriage of <I>N. meningitidis</I> than sulphadimidine at both two (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.80) and seven weeks after treatment (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59). In <LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1998</LINK> no significant difference was found between the effectiveness of azythromycin and rifampin at one and two weeks post-treatment (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.30 to 5.54 and RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.23 to 2.88, respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Judson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Judson 1984</LINK> found that at day seven, spectinomycin eradicated carriage of only one out of nine initial <I>N. meningitidis</I> carriers, while ceftriaxone eradicated carriage from 29 of 29 initial carriers. <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1984</LINK> found no difference between amoxycillin and bacampicillin for eradicating <I>N. meningitidis</I> (RR 1.4; 95% CI 0.16 to 12.60, favours bacampicillin).</P>

<P>Six trials assessed resistance development to rifampin (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deal-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Deal 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munford-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Munford 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK> rifampin-resistant isolates requiring minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 100 to 200 g/ml of rifampin were seen in 20 of 75 post-treatment isolates, while MICs increased from pre-treatment values of less than 0.25 g/ml to 2 to 6 g/ml in 37 additional isolates. All resistant isolates were detected among patients treated with rifampin. In <LINK REF="STD-Munford-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Munford 1974</LINK>, seven resistant isolates were detected out of 37 isolates among 67 patients treated with rifampin (MICs of 16 to 256 g/ml). All pre-treatment isolates were susceptible to rifampin and no resistance to rifampin developed among patients randomised to rifampin in addition to minocycline in this study. The meningococci identified in these two studies were serogroup B or C and all resistant isolates were identified as group C. One additional study assessing group A meningococci (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1980</LINK>) found an increase in rifampin MICs from less than 0.1 g/ml to 3.2 g/ml (three isolates) and 6.4 g/ml (one isolate) post-treatment.

<P>No direct evidence was available in this review for meningococcal disease prevention.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-19 15:25:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ciprofloxacin, rifampin, minocycline and penicillin proved effective at eradicating <I>N. meningitidi</I>s one week after treatment, compared to placebo. However, after a longer follow-up period of one to two weeks only rifampin, ciprofloxacin and penicillin still proved significantly effective when compared to placebo. No trials evaluated ceftriaxone against placebo but when compared to rifampin after one to two weeks of follow-up, ceftriaxone was more effective in a single study. Rifampin continued to be effective, compared to placebo, for up to four weeks of post-treatment follow-up. However, a disadvantage may exist as isolates resistant to rifampin were identified following prophylactic treatment.</P>
<P>When minocycline was compared with placebo, it proved ineffective after one to two weeks of follow-up; but when compared to rifampin after the same length of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munford-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Munford 1974</LINK>) and after five weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK>) no significant difference was found between the two antibiotics. It should be noted that the comparison between rifampin and minocycline after five weeks of follow-up is based on one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Guttler-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guttler 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chemoprophylactic treatment to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of <I>N. meningitidis</I> has been a key approach in the control of meningococcal disease for many decades (<LINK REF="REF-Samuelsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuelsson 2002</LINK>), despite the fact that its effectiveness for disease prevention has never been demonstrated in experimental research.</P>
<P>In 1937, sulphonamide therapy radically altered the outcome of meningococcal infection and replaced serum in its treatment. Prophylaxis with sulphonamides eradicated the carrier state and provided a simple and safe method for the prevention of epidemics, particularly in the crowded environments of military barracks. Increasing sulphonamide resistance among meningococci was recognised by Schoenback and Phair in 1941 to 1943 but did not become a clinically significant problem until meningococcal epidemics occurred in 1963, in two military bases in California. Since then, many agents have been evaluated as agents of eradication under the assumption that eradicating carriage would prevent meningococcal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rifampin penetrates well into body tissues, achieving therapeutic concentrations in the mucosa. Resistance to rifampin among meningococci, as for other bacteria, has been attributed to mutations in the rpoB gene that encodes the beta unit of the RNA polymerase enzyme, which is rifampin's target (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1994</LINK>). Increased minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for rifampin were described in three of six studies assessing pre- and post-treatment rifampin susceptibilities, with frank resistance developing in 10% to 27% of isolates in these studies. Thus, despite rifampin's eradication efficacy, a note of caution is required. Induction of resistance may complicate further attempts at eradication.</P>
<P>A recent review that included non-randomised studies, comparing treated and untreated groups, demonstrated that chemoprophylaxis (according to local guidelines) of household contacts reduced the risk of developing meningococcal disease (RR 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.58). No studies of non-household contacts met the inclusion criteria. Based on four studies, the pooled meningococcal disease attack rate among non-treated family contacts was estimated at five cases per 1000 household contacts (<LINK REF="REF-Purcell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purcell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on the median prevalence of carriers among household contacts of 230 per 1000 (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, 'Carrier rates') and the pooled RR obtained from the comparison of rifampin to placebo, the absolute risk reduction in such a population after a period of one week is 190 per 1000 (95% CI 177 per 1000 to 203 per 1000). Thus the number needed to treat (NNT) in order to eradicate carriage from one carrier is six (95% CI 5 to 20). As the risk of invasive disease following acquisition varies with environmental and host factors and strain characteristics we cannot estimate the NNT in order to prevent a case of meningococcal disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-14 06:00:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Under the assumption that eradication of <I>N. meningitidis</I> does reduce the risk of meningococcal infection, the most effective antibiotics to achieve eradication are ceftriaxone, rifampin and ciprofloxacin. Rifampin is usually the drug of choice in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1993</LINK>). However, given the facts that rifampin is contraindicated in pregnancy, liver disease and alcoholism, and long-term therapy causes orange discolouration of urine, staining of contact lenses and induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes which might render contraceptive pills ineffective, the use of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 2001</LINK>). In addition, despite rifampin's eradication efficacy a note of caution is required. Induction of resistance, seen as circulation of isolates with reduced sensitivity to rifampin, could complicate further attempts at prophylaxis, especially in an outbreak setting.</P>
<P>Although ceftriaxone is administered in a single intramuscular dose, resulting in more frequent adverse effects when compared to rifampin, intramuscular administration ensures adherence to prophylaxis (as opposed to oral administration) and the adverse effects recorded are mild. In addition, it can be given to young children and pregnant women. Ciprofloxacin is given in a single dose thus ensuring compliance and has minimal side effects but is contraindicated in pregnancy and is not recommended for use in children. Finally, trials evaluating ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone reported no development of resistance following treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Dworzack-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dworzack 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pugsley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pugsley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renkonen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Renkonen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-14 06:00:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although direct data on the effectiveness of eradication of the carrier state on disease prevention are missing, placebo-controlled trials do not seem ethical.</P>
<P>Trials comparing the effectiveness of ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and rifampin for eradicating <I>N. meningitidis</I> could provide important insights as may trials evaluating oral third-generation cephalosporins (cefixime, cefdinir, cefditoren-pivoxil, cefpodoxime-proxetil and ceftibuten). Trials should evaluate short (after one to two weeks) and long-term (more than two weeks) eradication rates, separating cases of persistent infection from cases of re-infection. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of isolates before and after treatment should be reported to allow for the assessment of the ecological impact of prophylactic treatment.</P>
