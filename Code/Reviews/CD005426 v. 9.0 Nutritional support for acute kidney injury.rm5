<P>Maintaining nutritional balance is vital in treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Nutritional therapies, including parenteral nutrition (delivered via injection) and enteric (oral) nutrition are widely used. Eight randomised controlled trials (257 participants) were included in this review. Essential L-amino acids may shorten the overall duration of kidney dysfunction and improved survival from AKI. However, due to the small number of participants and the poor quality of some studies, we are unable to provide recommendations for the use of nutritional support for treating AKI.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-04 15:46:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight studies (257 participants) were included. An overall pooled analysis was not performed due to the different interventions used and different outcomes measured. Selection bias was not reported (unclear) in six studies and was adequately reported (low) for random sequence generation in two studies. Participant/personnel blinding was adequately reported in one study and unclear in seven. Incomplete outcome reporting bias was low in six studies and high in two. Selective reporting was low in six studies, unclear in one study, and high in one study. No other biases were detected. There was a significant increase in recovery rate for AKI (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.79) and survival in dialysed patients (RR 3.56, 95% CI 0.97 to 13.08) for intravenous essential L-amino acids (EAA) compared to hypertonic glucose alone. Compared to lower calorie-total parenteral nutrition (TPN), higher calorie-TPN did not improve estimated nitrogen balance, protein catabolic rate, or urea generation rate; but increased serum triglycerides, glucose, insulin need and nutritional fluid administration. There was no difference between groups in estimated nitrogen balance, but there were differences between urea nitrogen appearance (MD 0.98, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.71) and net protein utilisation (MD 21.50%, 95% CI 0.39 to 42.61). Urea nitrogen appearance was lower in the low nitrogen intake group than in the high nitrogen intake group. There was no significant difference in death between EAA and general amino acids (GAA) (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.68). High dose amino acids did not improve cumulative water excretion, furosemide requirement, nitrogen balance or death compared to normal dose amino acids. Glucose+EAA+histidin had better nitrogen balance than glucose+GAA; glucose+nitrogen+fat significantly increased serum creatinine compared with glucose+GAA; glucose+EAA+histidin significantly improved nitrogen balance, U/P urea and serum creatinine, but increased plasma urea compared to glucose+nitrogen+fat.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-10-27 17:00:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterised by a rapid (hours to weeks) decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and retention of nitrogen waste products such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1980</LINK>). AKI is a syndrome caused by many different diseases and mechanisms. Clinical characters include albuminuria, hypertension, oedema, is usually associated with oliguria (urine output &lt; 30 mL/h or &lt; 400 mL/d), although urine output may be normal or increased (<LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>). According to the definition proposed by Acute Kidney Injury Network based of the RIFLE classification, AKI is the third stage of AKI, which characterised by the increase in serum creatinine (SCr) to more than 300% from baseline (or SCr &#8805; 4.0 mg/dL with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 µmol/L), or the urine output less than 0.3 mL/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours. AKI is a complication in critically ill patients and has a persistently high mortality rate in hospitalised patients (40% to 60%) (<LINK REF="REF-Fiaccadori-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiaccadori 1999</LINK>). In some patients with shock or sepsis and non functioning gastrointestinal tract, the death rate can reach 80% to 90%. Approximately 30% of admissions to intensive care units (ICU) develop AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 1983</LINK>), and half of these patients will die. Infection accounts for three quarters of these deaths with cardiorespiratory complications and cardiovascular disease the next most common causes of death (<LINK REF="REF-Feest-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feest 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santacruz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santacruz 1996</LINK>). The mortality in elderly patients with all forms of AKI is 53%, while paediatric patients with AKI have a mortality averaging 25%. Over the past 30 years, the survival rate for AKI has not improved, primarily because affected patients are now older and have more comorbid conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Feest-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feest 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-27 16:08:08 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment for AKI primarily relies on treating the underlying cause and maintaining the patient until kidney function has recovered. This will include, correcting fluid, electrolyte and uraemic abnormalities, treating infections and maintaining nutrition. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required for uncontrolled hyperkalaemia, acidosis or severe fluid overload (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffl 1994</LINK>). Intrarenal AKI (caused by direct injury to the kidneys including ischaemic hypoxic insults, renal artery obstruction, or renal vein occlusion) can be treated using glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), cyclophosphamide or other medication. In most cases of postrenal AKI (caused by blockage in the urinary tract) kidney function rapidly returns to normal upon removal of the obstruction. Recent studies report that in cells which recover from an ischaemic insult, growth factors may play a role in recovery, such as epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor or hepatocyte-type growth factor for intrarenal AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Fouque-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fouque 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-04 15:38:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In hypercatabolic AKI, where patients become nutritionally deficient in protein, energy requirements will exceed those that are conventionally prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Spreiter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spreiter 1980</LINK>). Thus nutritional care is particularly important because patients suffer not only from uraemia, metabolic acidosis, and fluid and electrolyte imbalance, but also from physiological stress (e.g. infection, tissue destruction or poisoning) which increases protein needs. Total caloric intake should be 30 to 45 kcal (126 to 189 kJ)/kg/d, and should come from a combination of carbohydrates and lipids. In patients not receiving dialysis, protein intake should be restricted to 0.6 g/kg/d, whereas patients on dialysis should have a protein intake of 1 to 1.5 g/kg/d (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfson 1993</LINK>). Some studies recommend a multifaceted approach using total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with essential and nonessential amino acids (ENAA) and possibly a larger proportion of the branched-chain amino acids, higher energy intake, anabolic agents, and continuous arterio-venous haemofiltration. These measures should improve morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1983</LINK>). The need for glutamine supplementation in dialysis patients with AKI is greater in the first days of continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (<LINK REF="REF-Novak-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novak 1997</LINK>) and vitamin supplementation is often inadequate and should be re-evaluated (<LINK REF="REF-Druml-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druml 1998</LINK>). Continuous RRT results in significant losses of selenium, copper, and thiamine (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2004</LINK>). Some recent studies suggest that parenteral nutrition leads to more infection compared to no nutritional therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2001</LINK>). A systematic review has suggested that enteric nutrition failed to show any clinical benefit compared to no nutritional therapy in critical ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007</LINK>). Whether artifical nutrition is important in a variety of diseases, including AKI remains controversial.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-20 16:57:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important to identify those who would benefit from nutritional support and to define the optimal time to initiate the support (<LINK REF="REF-Druml-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druml 1998</LINK>). In experimental animals, provision of amino acids or TPN accelerated tissue repair and recovery of AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Toback-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toback 1983</LINK>). In patients this has not been well documented. The effectiveness and safety of such treatment needs to be reviewed systematically and appraised critically to inform current practice.</P>

<P>ELAA significantly improved survival on dialysis, average slope of SCr level and BUN level, but there was no improvement in recovery from AKI, SCr, serum protein concentration or urea nitrogen appearance compared with hypertonic glucose. Compared to EAA, GAA significantly improved urea nitrogen appearance and net protein utilisation, but there was no significant improvement in death or estimated protein nitrogen balance. There was a significant difference in urea nitrogen balance between high ENAA nitrogen and low EAA nitrogen, but no difference in estimated protein nitrogen balance. High-dose AA did not improve nitrogen balance, death or haemodialysis requirement, but there was significant decrease in furosemide requirement between high-dose AA and normal-dose AA. Glucose + EAA + histidin significantly improved nitrogen balance compared with glucose+GAA and glucose + nitrogen + fat; glucose + nitrogen + fat significantly improved SCr compared to EAA and GAA. Compared with the lower calorie-TPN, the higher calorie-TPN regimen did not improve estimated nitrogen balance, protein catabolic rate, or urea generation rate, whereas it increased serum triglycerides, glucose, insulin need and nutritional fluid administration.</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirtallo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtallo 1982</LINK>) compared EAA with ENAA or GAA. The outcomes measured were the same (urea nitrogen appearance and estimated protein balance), however the doses were quite different in the ENAA group. Nitrogen was 2.2 g in the ENAA group in <LINK REF="STD-Mirtallo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtallo 1982</LINK> and 11.3 g in <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1983</LINK>. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Aguilar-1982" TYPE="STUDY">De Aguilar 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1980</LINK>) compared EAA and histidin with GAA. Only SCr was reported in all three studies. <LINK REF="STD-De-Aguilar-1982" TYPE="STUDY">De Aguilar 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1980</LINK> reported nitrogen balance, plasma urea, U/P urea, while <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1981</LINK> reported urea nitrogen appearance, serum proteins. Since most interventions and outcome measures were different for each study, we were only able to perform a few combined analyses. A similar problem occurred when subgroup analysis was attempted for <LINK REF="STD-Fiaccadori-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fiaccadori 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2007</LINK>. Both studies were carried out in critically ill patients in the ICU, however <LINK REF="STD-Fiaccadori-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fiaccadori 2005</LINK> compared different energy intakes and <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2007</LINK> compared high versus normal AA.</P>
<P>Only two studies reported mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Mirtallo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtallo 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2007</LINK>). Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Aguilar-1982" TYPE="STUDY">De Aguilar 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiaccadori-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fiaccadori 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirtallo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtallo 1982</LINK>) used urea nitrogen appearance and/or estimated protein balance as the measurements, and <LINK REF="STD-Mirtallo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtallo 1982</LINK> also used net protein utilisation to evaluate the nitrogen metabolism. <LINK REF="STD-Abel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Abel 1973</LINK> used recovery from AKI and average slope of SCr/BUN level as the measures of kidney function. <LINK REF="STD-Fiaccadori-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fiaccadori 2005</LINK> also measured serum triglycerides and glucose. We recommend future clinical studies use accredited and standard outcome measures in order to facilitate data analysis and conserve health resources.</P>
<P>The unclear results reported have also brought difficulties to the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Fiaccadori-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fiaccadori 2005</LINK> reported results in scatter plots without exact data, and only give the average estimated nitrogen balance, protein catabolic rate, urea generation rate, with no standard deviations making meta-analysis impossible.

<P>We found the studies analysed were of poor quality. Although the studies used randomised allocation, only <LINK REF="STD-Abel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Abel 1973</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Feinstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Feinstein 1981</LINK> described how the randomisation was performed but none described allocation concealment.

The other five studies did not describe withdrawals or drop-outs. While AKI is not a chronic disease, and there is generally no need to follow-up, studies should report the number of patients who need long-term haemodialysis for those with low or no recovery of kidney function.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-10-28 08:28:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The poor methodological quality of the studies may result in bias. For example, the difference in age in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2007</LINK>) may have influence on the baseline comparability. This may impact on the results, since patients in the high-dose AA group were significant older than patients in normal-dose group (P &lt; 0.05). No or inadequate allocation concealment may increase the risk of selection bias since participants may be included in the group the investigators think would be beneficial.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-21 17:54:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nutrition therapy for AKI has been studied for more than half century. After <LINK REF="STD-Abel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Abel 1973</LINK>, there has been several studies evaluating efficiency and safety of nutrition therapy for AKI. <LINK REF="STD-Leonard-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Leonard 1975</LINK> found no change in recovery of kidney function in EAA group compared with controlled group, unlike <LINK REF="STD-Abel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Abel 1973</LINK> which reported EAA appeared to hasten kidney function recovery. Other studies focused on the comparison between GAA and EAA. A non-randomised study by <LINK REF="REF-Freund-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freund 1980</LINK> compared parenteral nutrition using GAA with EAA data from <LINK REF="STD-Abel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Abel 1973</LINK>. They reported a significantly lower survival rate (9%) in the GAA group compared to the EAA group (75%), which was the reverse of the results of <LINK REF="STD-Mirtallo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtallo 1982</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Blumenkrantz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenkrantz 1978</LINK> reported no significant difference between EAA (21 g/d) and GAA (42 g/d) in serum urea nitrogen levels, serum urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios or urea appearance rates.</P>
<P>The value of nutritional treatment for AKI has been debated because of the concerns with the complications of parental nutrition therapy, and the relationship between changes in metabolism from nutritional treatment and survival has yet to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Sponsel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sponsel 1995</LINK>). Considering complications such as electrolyte and lipid imbalance, which is consistent with the outcomes of <LINK REF="STD-Fiaccadori-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fiaccadori 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sponsel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sponsel 1995</LINK> suggested nutrition therapy should be based on the estimated metabolic stress and protein-energy requirements of the individual AKI patients. Enteric nutrition has become more and more important in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Druml-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druml 2001</LINK>). Despite the difficulty in demonstrating clear-cut benefits of nutrition therapy, there is no doubt that nutritional treatment is important in the treatment of patients with AKI. <LINK REF="REF-Naylor-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 1987</LINK> performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of EAA, GAA and hypertonic glucose. Although the data suggested that EAA may show benefits compared to GAA and hypertonic glucose alone, the efficacy of these parenteral nutritional therapies remains uncertain.</P>

<P>More high quality clinical studies are required for assessing the effects of different nutritional supplements. Randomisation and methods of allocation concealment should be fully described to assist in the assessment of potential risk of bias. Studies should report the withdrawal and drop-out rates in order to judge sufficient sample available to analysis. Adverse effect should be reported in detail including the severity and numbers in each group. Studies should use accredited standard outcome measures which make combined analyses possible. These outcomes should include mortality, participants' perceived quality of life, length of hospital stay and the need for ongoing dialysis.</P>
