<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:07:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The hospital environment (such as sounds, pictures, aromas, design, air quality, furnishings, architecture, and layout), may have an impact on the health of patients within it. This review aims to summarise the best available evidence on hospital environments, in order to help people involved in the design of hospital environments make decisions that will benefit patients' health.</P>
<P>The review identified 102 relevant studies, 85 of which were on the use of music in hospital. Other environmental aspects considered were: aromas (two studies), audiovisual distractions (five studies), decoration (one study), air quality (three studies), bedroom type (one study), flooring (two studies), furniture and furnishings (one study), lighting (one study), temperature (one study), and multiple design changes (two studies). No studies meeting the inclusion criteria were found to evaluate: art, access to nature for example through hospital gardens, atriums, flowers, and plants, ceilings, interventions to reduce hospital noise, patient controls, technologies, way-finding aids, or the provision of windows.</P>
<P>Overall, it appears that music in hospital may help improve patient-reported outcomes such as anxiety; however, there is less evidence to support the use of music for physiological outcomes (such as reducing heart rate and blood pressure) and for reducing the use of medications. For other aspects of hospital environments, there are not very many well designed studies to help with making evidence-based design decisions. The studies that have been included in this review show that physical changes made to 'improve' the hospital environment on the whole do no harm.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:06:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (last searched January 2006); MEDLINE (1902 to December 2006); EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2006); 14 other databases covering health, psychology, and the built environment; reference lists; and organisation websites. This review is currently being updated (MEDLINE last search October 2010), see Studies awaiting classification.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-07-30 10:31:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted times series of environmental interventions in adult hospital patients reporting health-related outcomes.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:06:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We contacted authors to obtain missing information. For continuous variables, we calculated a mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. For dichotomous variables, we calculated a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). When appropriate, we used a random-effects model of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored qualitatively and quantitatively based on risk of bias, case mix, hospital visit characteristics, and country of study.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:07:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, 102 studies have been included in this review. Interventions explored were: 'positive distracters', to include aromas (two studies), audiovisual distractions (five studies), decoration (one study), and music (85 studies); interventions to reduce environmental stressors through physical changes, to include air quality (three studies), bedroom type (one study), flooring (two studies), furniture and furnishings (one study), lighting (one study), and temperature (one study); and multifaceted interventions (two studies). We did not find any studies meeting the inclusion criteria to evaluate: art, access to nature for example, through hospital gardens, atriums, flowers, and plants, ceilings, interventions to reduce hospital noise, patient controls, technologies, way-finding aids, or the provision of windows. Overall, it appears that music may improve patient-reported outcomes such as anxiety; however, the benefit for physiological outcomes, and medication consumption has less support. There are few studies to support or refute the implementation of physical changes, and except for air quality, the included studies demonstrated that physical changes to the hospital environment at least did no harm.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-12 16:27:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Music may improve patient-reported outcomes in certain circumstances, so support for this relatively inexpensive intervention may be justified. For some environmental interventions, well designed research studies have yet to take place.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-03 10:24:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-03 07:32:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The International Academy for Design and Health held its 7th World Congress in 2011, highlighting the growing multinational interest in environmental design that promotes health. A reform on a global scale is underway to make hospitals much more than places to go and receive treatment; hospitals are now being conceptualised as places that have the potential to positively impact health through being restorative, healing environments (<LINK REF="REF-Dilani-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dilani 2001</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the important role of the environment in the health process, and calls for action towards creating supportive environments (<LINK REF="REF-_x0027_Ottowa_x0027_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">'Ottowa' 2004</LINK>). In accordance with this movement, international organisations such as The Centre for Health Design (CHD) have been established (<LINK REF="REF-_x0027_CHD_x0027_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">'CHD' 2009</LINK>). CHD's mission is 'to transform healthcare environments for a healthier, safer world through design research, education and advocacy'.</P>
<P>Other initiatives have been stimulated by the US-based Society for the Arts in Healthcare (<LINK REF="REF-_x0027_SAH_x0027_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">'SAH' 2009</LINK>), which attempts to advance arts as an integral component in health care, and the UK-based Medical Architecture Research Unit (<LINK REF="REF-Etheridge-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etheridge 2008</LINK>), which provides research, consultancy, and training, with a vision to "explore the interface between health service organisational culture and the built environment response". Research into, and implementation of 'healing' healthcare environments is also being carried out in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takayanagi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takayanagi 2004</LINK>), and across Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Pelikan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelikan 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Middle East, various major investment projects have been supporting a rapid growth in the hospital sector (<LINK REF="REF-News-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">News 2004</LINK>) and the hospital industry in the United States has been going through a major building boom with billions more dollars being spent on replacing or renovating old facilities (<LINK REF="REF-Babwin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babwin 2002</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) has prompted a renewed interest in hospital design, investing billions of pounds into the biggest new hospital building programme in the history of the NHS (<LINK REF="REF-Milburn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milburn 2001</LINK>). Investments such as these have provided an opportunity for hospitals to be considered as 'therapeutic environments' (<LINK REF="REF-Gesler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gesler 2004</LINK>), spurring on initiatives such as the UK-based scheme in which the Kings Fund and the Department of Health offer grants to health authorities to enhance the environment (<LINK REF="REF-_x0027_Kings-Fund_x0027_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">'Kings Fund' 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some argue that this expenditure is a waste of resources (<LINK REF="REF-Lipley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipley 2001</LINK>), whilst others have highlighted the lack of 'evidence-based practice' when it comes to hospital design (<LINK REF="REF-Frumkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frumkin 2003</LINK>). Schemes set up to enhance the hospital environment are sometimes not evaluated on the grounds that it is too logistically complex (<LINK REF="REF-Comer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comer 1982</LINK>), or by simply stating that the effects are obvious (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2000</LINK>). There is some empirical evidence in support of creating better environments in care facilities however, and researchers are finding that changes to the physical environment can positively influence patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Devlin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devlin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1996</LINK>). In an invitation-only conference entitled 'Designing the 21st Century Hospital: serving patients and staff', held by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (<LINK REF="REF-_x0027_Webcast_x0027_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">'Webcast' 2004</LINK>), Craig Zimring and Roger Ulrich referred to a literature review they had conducted, finding over 600 studies on the effects of the hospital environment on patients, families and staff (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2004a</LINK>, later updated: <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK>). In their presentation of the research, Zimring and Ulrich emphasised the evidence mainly in terms of quantity and consistency of findings. Following the presentations, delegates discussed how worthwhile applying quality criteria to the current evidence would be, such as in a Cochrane systematic review.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:08:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The environment can be altered in endless ways. Some environmental changes may be detrimental to health (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>), further exemplifying the need for using evidence-based design. As a framework for assessing the evidence on hospital design, the literature could be considered in terms of whether it regards: (1) aspects that are added to the environment as positive distracters (such as art and music); and (2) aspects of the environment that are changed to reduce stressors (such as light, noise or air quality).</P>
<P>In this review, we are interested in elements of the sensory environment; that is, aspects of the hospital surroundings that can be seen, touched, smelt, or heard (such as the building design and layout, decor, furniture and furnishings, air quality and aromas/odours, and noises/sounds). In this review we utilise the phrase 'sensory environment' to define the hospital characteristics under study; in the literature, other terms are utilised such as 'healing environments', 'supportive environments', and 'health-promoting environments'. We have opted for a less directive phrase as we are interested in determining which environmental factors have positive, negative, and neutral effects on the health of individuals.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-03 07:32:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sensory environments have been advocated on the basis of their perceived ability to reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, improve postoperative outcomes, reduce the need for pain medication, and shorten the hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 1992</LINK>); good design has also been implicated to improve quality of sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Hewitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewitt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marberry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marberry 2002</LINK>), reduce hospital acquired infections (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2004b</LINK>), and improve staff retention and well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marberry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marberry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1998</LINK>). Theories underpinning these effects are wide-ranging and stem from a variety of perspectives, for example: Attention Restorative Theory (a 'functionalist-evolutionary' model; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1989</LINK>); a 'psycho-evolutionary' model (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 1983</LINK>) and the Biophilia Hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 1993a</LINK>); Henry's model of neuro-endocrine responses (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1991</LINK>, which incorporates the ideas of the 'Fight or Flight' response to environmental stressors and Selye's model of stress and disease, 'General Adaptation Syndrome'); the Intake-Reject Hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lacey-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacey 1974</LINK>), a controversial hypothesis which has implications for distraction therapies; the 'Gate Control Theory' (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1965</LINK>) and the 'Neuromatrix Theory' of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1999</LINK>); and the Broaden-and-Build model (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrickson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrickson 2000</LINK>), which offers a premise for creating environments which help cultivate positive emotions. We will not go into a full explanation and debate of all these theories here, but suffice is to say that although there are some disparities between these explanatory models, and some sit controversially within their fields, they complement each other on the general principles that removing environmental stressors, and using the environment to calm, distract, and elicit positive emotions may have positive implications for health.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-10-12 16:31:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Amy K Drahota">
<P>Clearly this is a broad and complex area of study, with the 'environment' being considered as an intervention influencing health-related outcomes; nevertheless, it is imperative that the evidence-base for sensory environments is assessed systematically, to ensure that patients are provided with the best possible opportunity to recover and that the system remains cost-effective.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:08:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Amy K Drahota">
<P>In this area of research it may often be very difficult to conduct a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) due to the nature of the intervention and logistical complexities. Therefore, this review included a variety of study designs: RCTs, (non-randomised) Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs), Controlled Before and After studies (CBAs), and Interrupted Time Series (ITS). To be included in the review, a CBA had to have two intervention sites and two concurrent control sites with outcomes measured both before and after the intervention was implemented. An ITS had to have at least three data collection points before the intervention, and at least a further three data collection points after the intervention. All studies must have been conducted prospectively.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:09:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included adults attending hospital as in-patients, day hospital or out-patients. Studies were included if over 90% of the participants were over 18. Both elective and non-elective patients were included in the review.

<P>Where possible, studies were characterised by the type of hospital visit, where 90% of participants was considered as a cut-off point for inclusion in a specific category. In-patients were classed as those that required a hospital bed and required an overnight stay for tests or surgery; day-patients were patients that required a hospital bed for specialised observation or health care for a limited number of hours of the day, but did not need to stay overnight; out-patients were people who were referred to see a hospital consultant for a specialist opinion or examination and did not require a hospital bed.</P>

<P>The review incorporated studies that investigated any aspect(s) of the sensory environment. Interventions were those that altered the environment by one or a mixture of the following ways.</P>
<P>(1) Providing positive distracters to complement the treatment already being administered. Positive distracters are elements of the sensory environment; they do not include therapies (such as bright light therapy), which are received instead of orthodox treatments. Patients could be offered a choice of distraction but we did not include instances when patients were actively involved in creating a distraction (e.g. creating a work of art). Positive distracters included:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>aromas/scents (different aromas/patient choice of aroma versus none);</LI>
<LI>viewing artwork (comparing different styles/patient choice of art versus no art);</LI>
<LI>viewing performance art (versus none);</LI>
<LI>audiovisual distractions, such as television/video (absent versus present/differences between content/patient choice of content);</LI>
<LI>decoration (colour of walls etc.);</LI>
<LI>music (versus no music, different styles of music, or other environmental comparison);</LI>
<LI>access to nature, for example via atriums, gardens, window views, or indoor planting (versus no access to nature, other views or urban retreats).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>(2) Reducing environmental stressors by implementing physical changes. We have not included changes that are made to policy (e.g. ensuring multi-bed rooms are unisex). Physical changes to the sensory environment include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>noise-reducing aids (e.g. sound-absorbing ceiling tiles versus regular);</LI>
<LI>way-finding aids (e.g. colour-zoned areas, landmarks);</LI>
<LI>patient controls (e.g. access to lighting and ventilation controls);</LI>
<LI>lighting (e.g. natural versus fluorescent);</LI>
<LI>people/privacy (e.g. open versus closed wards, decentralised nurse stations).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>(3) Multi-faceted interventions:<BR/>Some studies manipulate many variables and as such span across the above three broad categories of environmental interventions (such as when a whole ward is redesigned; <LINK REF="STD-Leather-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leather 2003</LINK>). We have included these studies in the review provided they were not confounded with non-environmental changes, such as changes to policy.</P>
<P>We excluded studies from the review if the intervention was not clearly defined (to the extent that it could be replicated). In order to meet this requirement, studies must have, where applicable, either:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>provided the manufacturing details of the intervention being assessed, if appropriate;</LI>
<LI>provided pictures or diagrams, if appropriate;</LI>
<LI>provided a detailed description of the objective properties of the intervention, (e.g. an intervention of colour change needs to describe the specific hue; simply stating 'blue' is not specific enough);</LI>
<LI>provided a contact from which more detailed information could be sought.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>All studies were carried out in a hospital setting. A hospital was defined (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2008</LINK>) as a health facility that:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>provides communal care where there is an expectation that this care is time limited;</LI>
<LI>provides overnight accommodation;</LI>
<LI>provides nursing and personal care;</LI>
<LI>provides for people with illness and disability.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This definition includes hospices.</P>
<P>Studies may have been conducted in any area of the hospital grounds, such as general wards, specialist wards (e.g. Intensive Care Units), waiting rooms, common areas, and gardens.</P>

<P>This review included all validated health-related patient outcomes reported in the research. Outcomes of interest included validated measures of: anxiety; pain; length of hospital stay; patients' satisfaction; quality of sleep; aggression and mood; physiological outcomes; medication utilisation; hospital-acquired infections; and mortality. We included a broad range of outcomes since the environment may affect many aspects of a patient's physical and psychological health and different interventions may be applicable to some outcomes and not others.

<P>One review author (AD) conducted the initial search (Trials Search Co-ordinator 'JM' conducted the EMBASE search). The initial search of databases retrieved 78,480 'hits'; these were screened for relevance and the majority of deleted records were double-checked by a second review author. After screening, 15,140 titles were recorded on the main review database. Two review authors (AD/RS/DW/TD/EG) independently screened the studies obtained from the initial search. Each title was rated as 'hit' (maybe eligible), 'unsure' (probably not eligible) or 'reject' (not to be assessed further). Any disagreement with regard to eligibility was resolved through a third review author and discussion where necessary. We obtained full-text (English and non-English) papers for the 'hits' and abstracts for the 'unsures'. All abstracts (2029 total) were assessed independently by two review authors (AD/RS/DW/TD/EG) and rated as 'hit', 'unsure', or 'reject'. We then obtained full-text papers (524 total) for 'hits' and 'unsures' and these were assessed for inclusion by at least two review authors. We discussed full-text papers rated as 'unsure' in group meetings. A final corpus of 102 studies was selected for inclusion in the review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for a flow diagram of the study process).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:15:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Amy K Drahota">
<P>The results section is structured alphabetically by intervention (and control) with multi-intervention studies (e.g. whole ward redesign) being grouped as a separate category. Where appropriate, we have summarised the results of each intervention against different types of control (e.g. other form of environment, standard care) separately; this is because the effectiveness of interventions will vary depending on the comparison, and it may not be appropriate to combine all different types of control group together. Outcomes for individual interventions are looked at in turn and the heterogeneity of the studies explored.</P>
<P>For continuous variables, we calculated a mean difference (MD) for identical measures, or standardized mean difference (SMD), where different techniques were used to measure the same outcome domain, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. For dichotomous variables, we calculated a risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We used sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of risk of bias ('similarities at baseline'; 'sequence generation'; 'concealment of allocation'; 'completeness of data'; and 'blinding of healthcare personnel'), and the influence of deciding to include individual studies that were ambiguous as to whether they met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Where statistical analyses were inappropriate or unfeasible, a discursive account of the results is presented with supporting tables. When it was appropriate to combine the studies, we used a random-effects model of meta-analysis. We have presented continuous data that were reported using medians and ranges in tables only.</P>

The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2</SUP> was evaluated in conjunction with (i) magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) strength of evidence for heterogeneity (i.e. P value from the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test).

<P>The 85 included RCTs investigating music (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>), resulted in a total sample of 6061 patients. Including two cross-over trials (of 24 and 20 participants respectively; <LINK REF="STD-Davis_x002d_Rollans-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Davis-Rollans 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2001</LINK>). There were 2980 patients allocated to music, and 3124 allocated to a control (leaving one unknown case due to poor reporting in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>). Patient characteristics were not reported in all of the studies; however, based on the 69 studies that reported information on mean age (details for 1108 participants remain unknown), the mean population age was 53.82 years old (range 14 to 99 years old; NB. &gt; 90% of participants were 18 or older). Based on the 71 studies that reported information on gender, there were 2874 males and 2642 females included in the review (545 unknown cases). Studies were conducted in 16 different countries, predominantly the USA (N = 43) and China (N = 10). Five studies were conducted in each of Sweden and Canada, four in Germany, three in each of England and Taiwan, two in each of Australia, Japan, Turkey, and India, and one in each of Spain, Austria, Thailand, Slovenia, and Poland (NB. one study was carried out in two countries). The use of music was investigated in patients waiting for medical procedures (N = 13), undergoing endoscopic examinations (N = 12), undergoing percutaneous or surgical medical interventions (N = 34), undergoing non-invasive medical procedures (N = 6), during labor (N = 1), post-surgery (N = 7), in coronary care or intensive care environments (N = 10), or in ward environments (N = 2).</P>
<P>Typically the music intervention consisted of the patient choosing from a selection of music compilations offered by the researcher (N = 46). Some studies asked the patient to bring music from home to listen to (N = 7), whilst others offered a fixed condition chosen by the researcher (N = 32), with three of these being sounds of nature as opposed to music. Studies utilised a variety of comparison groups (with 11 studies utilising two comparison groups): standard care alone (N = 52); blank tape/headphones only (N = 25); white noise (N = 4); pre-recorded operating room noise (N = 4); restful environment (N = 9); and audiovisual distraction (N = 2). Given that the type of comparison may influence the size or direction of treatment effect, each comparison is dealt with separately in the review.</P>
<P>Studies investigated the use of music on: patient-reported anxiety (N = 52), patient-reported pain (N = 32, see the Cochrane review <LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>, which has overlapping scope), blood pressure (N = 43), heart rate (N = 45), respiration rate (N = 20), pain-medication requirements (N = 23, see also <LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>), anxiolytic medication requirements (N = 5), peripheral skin temperature (N = 4), skin conductance (N = 2), oxygen saturation (N = 5), requirement of oxygen supplementation (N = 1), lung function (N = 1), blood flow (N = 1), heart rate variability (N = 1), bispectral index (N = 3), stress hormones (N = 6), mood (N = 4), depression (N = 1), sleep quality (N = 2), headache (N = 1), fatigue (N = 4), urinary problems (N = 1), well-being (N = 2), nausea (N = 5), uncertainty (N = 1), satisfaction (N = 5), length of stay (N = 8), time to mobilisation (N = 1), induction time of sedation (N = 1), activities of daily living (N = 1), and interleukins (N = 1).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of bias in included studies on music:</HEADING>
<P>Of the 85 RCTs, method of randomisation was unclear in 42 studies. The remaining studies allocated participants to groups via a computer-generated sequence (N = 19), a table of random numbers (N = 11), drawing lots (N = 9), or coin flips (N = 4). Reporting of allocation concealment was poor with only 11 of 85 studies reporting adequate allocation concealment. Five RCTs had inadequate allocation concealment and 69 studies remain unclear. Blinding to group allocation was achieved in some studies that utilised a control condition involving headphones. Blinding of healthcare personnel and/or the data collector was reported in 20 studies, and double-blinding of patients and staff was achieved in four studies which investigated the use of music during surgery with general anaesthesia. For studies comparing music to standard care, blinding to group allocation was not possible. Blinded assessment of patient-reported outcomes was generally not possible for music interventions. Other outcomes, such as physiological measures, were reported as automated in 12 studies. Blinded assessment of at least one outcome was achieved in 16 studies. For 43 studies, no blinding or automation of any outcome measure was achieved, and in six studies it was unclear whether any of the outcomes were blinded or automated. The remaining studies had outcomes rated as a mixture of 'not done' and 'unclear' for blinded assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>Completeness of data (i.e. outcomes obtained for &gt; 80% of participants) was also poorly reported, with 49 studies scoring as 'done' on this measure (31 were unclear). Five RCTs had incomplete (&lt; 80%) data for at least one outcome measure. Reporting of withdrawals and drop-outs was not done in the majority of studies (N = 47). In the 38 studies which did report withdrawals and drop-outs, attrition ranged from zero to 33 participants per study, amounting to 235 withdrawals. Only 22 studies specified from which groups participants withdrew, and overall in these instances the music and control groups had similar attrition (43 and 49 participants respectively; missing information on 143 withdrawals). When studies are weighted according to final sample size, four RCTs arise as outliers in the number of withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Broscious-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Broscious 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korunka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Korunka 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phumdoung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Phumdoung 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twiss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Twiss 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Korunka-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Korunka 1992</LINK> withdrew 23 participants due to missing data (unclear from which groups), and reasons for the withdrawals (N = 92) from the other three studies are largely unrelated to the intervention itself.</P>

<P>Studies conducted in the pre-procedure period were fairly homogenous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and were in favour of the use of music as compared with headphones only (SMD &#8722;0.82, 95% CI &#8722;1.03 to &#8722;0.60, P value &lt; 0.00001). This translates into a mean difference of approximately &#8722;9.58 points (95% CI &#8722;12.04 to &#8722;7.02) on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (assuming an SD of 11.64; <LINK REF="REF-Millar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 1995</LINK>), approximately &#8722;23.2 mm (95% CI &#8722;29.2 to &#8722;17.0) on a 100 mm VAS (assuming an SD of 28.35; <LINK REF="REF-Millar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 1995</LINK>), or approximately &#8722;3.8 points (95% CI &#8722;4.7 to &#8722;2.7) on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (assuming an SD of 4.59; <LINK REF="REF-Millar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies conducted during medical procedures were also fairly homogenous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 26%), however, once combined these studies (with 91 and 92 participants in the music and headphones groups respectively) show no strong evidence of an effect when comparing music with headphones alone (SMD &#8722;0.12, 95% CI &#8722;0.47 to 0.23, P value = 0.49). Not included in this estimate is <LINK REF="STD-Andrada-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrada 2004</LINK> (with 63 and 55 participants in the music and headphones groups respectively); this study showed a significant difference in change scores (MD &#8722;5.08, 95% CI &#8722;9.04 to &#8722;1.12). If <LINK REF="STD-Andrada-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrada 2004</LINK> were to be included in the analysis, it is likely therefore to increase the heterogeneity and modify the effect estimate somewhat in favour of the music group.</P>

All studies included in this comparison were carried out on non-psychiatric populations. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA (n = 19), four in China (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor_x002d_Piliae-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor-Piliae 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 2003</LINK>), two in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Bally-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bally 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lepage 2001</LINK>), one in each of Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>), Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Argstatter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Argstatter 2006</LINK>), England (<LINK REF="STD-Padmanabhan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Padmanabhan 2005</LINK>), and Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2005</LINK>).

It is likely therefore that location has little to do with the size of treatment effects for this comparison.</P>
<P>A post-hoc subgroup analysis of all studies according to whether patients were provided with a choice of music or were provided with a set piece(s) selected by the researcher, suggests that providing patients with set pieces <I>increases</I> the average effect size.

<P>Whereas for most studies allocation concealment is unclear, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2001</LINK>) definitely did not use allocation concealment.

One study (<LINK REF="STD-White-1999" TYPE="STUDY">White 1999</LINK>) included a restful environment for the intervention group.

The one study conducted during non-invasive procedures (lithotripsy; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1998b</LINK>) also found no strong evidence of an effect. The two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kotwal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kotwal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Triller 2006</LINK>) conducted during endoscopic procedures had mixed findings (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60.6%), as did the 11 studies conducted during percutaneous interventions (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73.1%). One study on post-operative patients (<LINK REF="STD-Masuda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Masuda 2005</LINK>, MD 0.20 bpm, 95% CI &#8722;8.66 to 9.06), and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-White-1999" TYPE="STUDY">White 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmerman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmerman 1988</LINK>) conducted on patients recovering from myocardial infarction (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 6.9%, MD &#8722;3.65 bpm, 95% CI &#8722;11.76 to 4.47) also found no strong evidence of an effect.

<P>Studies were mostly conducted in the USA (N = 12), whilst some were conducted in China (N = 3), Taiwan (N = 2), India (N = 1), Japan (N =1), Slovenia (N = 1), and Germany (N = 1).

Removing <LINK REF="STD-Allen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2001</LINK> from this subgroup reduces the heterogeneity (to I<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.1%) and results in a mean difference of &#8722;0.97 bpm (95% CI &#8722;2.65 to 0.70, P value = 0.26), showing no strong evidence of an effect.

<P>A number of studies reported on additional outcomes which we have summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>. For this set of outcomes, apart from fatigue and uncertainty, significant differences in favour of music were found for most patient-reported outcomes (mood, anger, depression, nausea, and satisfaction). Groups did not differ however, on most physiological outcomes (skin temperature, oxygen saturation, blood flow, bispectral index, lung function, requirement for oxygen supplementation). Findings for the outcome cortisol are mixed, and there was no strong evidence of an effect for other stress hormones (prolactin and catecholamines). Significant differences in favour of the music group were found for intubation time and length of stay (although another study at higher risk of bias, with insufficient data for extraction, was non-significant). It should be noted that few studies reported on each of these outcomes (for 10 of the 16 outcomes only one study is included), and in some cases the risk of bias in studies is high.</P>

Completeness of outcome data was achieved on the day of surgery and the first and second post-operative days, but not for the third to fifth post-operative days (as patients were discharged). All patients included in the study were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and attrition was determined by length of stay in the ward. It is unclear if the study is at risk of selective outcome reporting. It is likely that patients were protected against contamination (as they stayed in single-occupancy rooms) although no attempt was made to control patients' use of window blinds or overhead lighting, which may have affected their exposure.</P>

In these two studies there were 171 psychiatric participants. <LINK REF="STD-Kasmar-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kasmar 1968</LINK> does not make clear how many participants were assigned to each group (details of 115 participants are unknown), however in <LINK REF="STD-Vaaler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaaler 2005</LINK> there were 31 participants in a refurbished wing, and 25 in the traditional wing. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kasmar-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kasmar 1968</LINK> were aged 16 to 66 years old, it is unclear how many participants were under 18 years old (34% were aged 16 to 22 years), or if indeed this study should be excluded in the review for this reason. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Vaaler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaaler 2005</LINK> were on average 37.07 years old. Overall, there were 84 males and 87 females included in the studies, with one conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Kasmar-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kasmar 1968</LINK>) and the other in Norway (<LINK REF="STD-Vaaler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaaler 2005</LINK>).

<P>Interventions were a 'beautiful room', neat and well-kept, with burnt-yellow carpeting, abstract picture, artificial plant, wooden waste-basket, and indirect lighting provided by a contemporary desk lamp (<LINK REF="STD-Kasmar-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kasmar 1968</LINK>), and a refurbished wing (<LINK REF="STD-Vaaler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaaler 2005</LINK>), which was redecorated and refurbished to look like a Norwegian home, with wainscoting walls, colourful wallpaper and paintings, lowered ceilings, multiple lighting spots, "tasteful" curtains, wardrobes, chairs, flowers, personal items, and an Italian ceramic tiled bathroom. Control areas were an 'ugly room' (<LINK REF="STD-Kasmar-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kasmar 1968</LINK>), which was carpetless, beige asphalt floor tiling, overhead fluorescent lighting, unkempt, with work papers strewn over the furniture and an overflowing grey metal wastebasket and ashtray, and a 'traditional wing' (<LINK REF="STD-Vaaler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaaler 2005</LINK>), which at four years old was well kept with few signs of damage, had sparse furniture, grey walls, lacking pictures, no window curtains, single lamps in the 4 m-high ceilings, bathrooms with grey, laminated paint, and patient rooms with a single bed and metal-tubed chair.</P>

For the purposes of this review, this study has been classified as a CCT (non-randomised) as although there was an element of randomisation (method not described), it appears that participants were not randomly allocated to room type, as this was dependent on the previous allocation. The paper states that psychiatrist and room type were matched. In <LINK REF="STD-Kasmar-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kasmar 1968</LINK>, allocation concealment is unclear.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Vaaler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaaler 2005</LINK>, patients were admitted to the wing with fewest patients, or (if there were even numbers of patients on each wing) to the wing which did not receive the last patient.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Providing positive distracters</HEADING>
<P>We found studies for a number of interventions which could be used as positive distractions in hospital environments. These interventions included: music, audiovisual distractions, visual distractions, decoration, and aromas. Studies reported on a variety of health-related outcomes, and here we will focus on patient-reported anxiety and pain, anxiolytic and pain medication requirements, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate.<BR/>
<BR/>In general, the findings support the use of music for reduction of patient-reported anxiety, particularly in the pre-procedure period which was favourable compared with both standard care and blank headphones. For use during medical procedures, music was preferable to standard care but there was no strong evidence of an effect when music was compared with a blank tape with headphones (note, we have not statistically assessed the difference between the comparison of 'music versus standard care' and 'music versus blank tape with headphones'). This may imply that it is the reduction of unpleasant noise, rather than the addition of music, which accounts for significant findings when music is compared with standard care, or that the studies using standard care as a control group were at higher risk of bias (as healthcare personnel were not blinded to study groups). Alternatively, the attention associated with providing patients with a blank tape and headphones may explain why this is just as effective as providing music. Some studies reported on anxiolytic medication requirements, but these findings did not always parallel the findings for patient-reported anxiety. For physiological measures (heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate), findings are less positive. On these outcomes mixed results are obtained when comparing music with standard care. However, as with some of the findings for anxiety, when comparing music to blank tape (or headphones), studies tend to show no strong evidence of an effect. Only one study (comparing music with pre-recorded operating room noise) found music to increase systolic blood pressure, and all other outcomes reported by all studies, if not positively in favour of music, demonstrated that the addition of music did not do any harm. Evidence on music for pain relief is reported in <LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether patients should be provided with a choice of music or provided with set pieces. For some outcomes and comparisons, set pieces seem preferable, whereas for others a choice of music appears preferable. This may reflect that it is not 'having a choice' which is most important but rather the 'content' of the music that makes the difference. The geographical location of studies does not appear to influence the heterogeneity of the findings so it appears that patients may react similarly to music interventions regardless of location. In this review, we have not explored the relationship between musical content and country of study, or how the content of music relates to the study findings.</P>
<P>There were fewer studies that investigated the use of audiovisual distractions. Three audiovisual studies had mixed results (showing positive findings and no difference) for anxiety compared with standard care. A number of explanations may explain these differences, including the type of audiovisual distraction (the dynamic distractions were positive and the static distraction showed no strong evidence of an effect). The studies on audiovisual distraction for patient-reported pain were all positively in favour of audiovisual distraction (compared with standard care) but to different degrees. One study reporting on sedation medication requirements had results in the same positive direction as the patient-reported pain findings. Two studies had heterogeneous findings for audiovisual distraction versus audio distraction for pain. Audiovisual distraction was no better than audio alone for anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure.</P>
<P>One study compared audiovisual distraction with visual distraction alone on the outcomes pain and pain medications, and found audiovisual distraction to be preferable. One study found that audiovisual distraction was no better than scheduled rest for anxiety, pain, blood pressure and heart rate. The one study included on decoration had small study groups and found no difference between groups on anxiety, pain medication and length of stay. One study on aromas reported a positive effect for anxiety, whilst another found improvements in agitation levels. One study found no strong evidence of aroma effects for depression, fatigue, and general health.</P>
<P>On the whole, it appears that some positive distractions in hospital may prove worthwhile for improving patient-reported outcomes such as pain and anxiety, however, the benefit of these interventions for physiological outcomes (heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate) has less support. It is also unclear if the benefits that positive distractions may have for patient-reported outcomes translate directly in to reduced medication usage.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reducing environmental stressors by implementing physical changes</HEADING>
<P>Included in the review are studies that looked at lighting, air quality, temperature, bedroom types, flooring, and furniture; each reporting on a range of relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>Patient rooms facing directions which allow more sunlight in were found to be no different than darker rooms for reducing anxiety and pain (one study reporting on each). However, pain medication requirement was found to be less in sunnier rooms (findings from one study), as was perceived stress.</P>
<P>There was no strong evidence of an effect of air quality, as controlled by various air conditioning systems, on various measures of infection (number of infections, cases of septicaemia, incidence of invasive aspergillosis, number of septic episodes, presence of resistant bacteria, and acquisitions of <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>), mortality, or remission. Additionally one study reported that there were cases of poor psychologic tolerance of confinement in a laminar air flow room. One study on temperature of operating theatres found that warmer rooms were beneficial for patients under general anaesthesia but made no difference to those with epidural anaesthesia in terms of temperature loss.</P>
<P>One study included on single- and multi-bed rooms found no difference between room types on infection rates. Two studies were included on flooring and each investigated different outcomes. One study found no difference between carpet and linoleum for number of falls and fallers, independence, and length of stay. However, elderly people had a faster gait and longer stride on carpeted floor compared to vinyl. One study included on furniture, found reclining chairs to produce less patient-reported pain and more satisfaction than hospital gurneys.</P>
<P>These studies represent a diverse range of physical modifications that could be made to hospital environments. There are few studies included for each intervention, and many of the studies included are at unclear or high risk of bias. Some environmental interventions appear to have positive effects, whilst others provide no strong evidence of an effect and may even indicate harmful effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Multifaced interventions</HEADING>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:35:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of studies included in this review explored the use of music. Few studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria for other forms of environmental intervention. The inclusion criteria were broad, making the review applicable to all types of adult patients attending hospital for any reason. The downside to this inclusiveness means that much heterogeneity exists between the studies, so interpretation and application of the findings requires that attention is paid to the specific scenarios in which the included studies were conducted. There were a number of environmental interventions which were searched for but no studies meeting the methodological criteria were found. This means there are gaps in the evidence for interventions on: art, nature, ceilings, windows, and layout. It is sometimes argued that it is too logistically complex to conduct studies with good methodological designs on environmental interventions, however, this review has demonstrated that it is possible (as some studies have been included), however, for some interventions these types of studies have yet to take place.</P>
<P>To assist with the manageability of the review process, the inclusion criteria for this review was limited to the hospital setting; other evidence exists pertaining to, for example, dentists, nursing and care home environments, which has not been systematically assessed by this review. Furthermore, it is possible that the hospital environment may also impact on staff, having more indirect effects on patient care and outcomes; this evidence is currently lacking however, as summarised in another Cochrane systematic review focusing on the effects of the healthcare environment on staff outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Tanja_x002d_Dijkstra-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanja-Dijkstra 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies included in this review have a wide geographical spread, covering Australasia, North America, Asia, and Europe. There are no studies included from Africa or South America, and the transferability of the findings of this review to low-to-middle-income countries is unknown. Heterogeneity between included studies was not easily explained by geographical location implying that this factor may not be so important (i.e. the findings are transferable across the locations assessed).</P>
<P>We have not undertaken to formally include economic evaluations as part of this review. For the majority of interventions pertaining to the sensory hospital environment, the evidence-base for effectiveness is limited due to lack of studies and poorly rated studies, this should not be confused however with evidence of no effect; it may be cost-effective to implement changes to the sensory environment, however this is not known and more robust evidence of effectiveness is required.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-08-10 07:37:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence is quite varied. Much of the evidence was rated poorly due to a lack of clarity in the reporting as opposed to definitively being at high risk of bias (although this could have also been the case). A number of non-randomised controlled trials were found, and we did not summarise these for music interventions since there were many randomised trials conducted in this area. However, we have reported on non-randomised controlled trials for other interventions where the body of evidence is much smaller. Whereas sometimes the approach of not randomly allocating patients to groups is understandable for logistical reasons (e.g. when patient allocation is dictated by hospital room availability); in other cases there is no real valid reason why randomisation could not have been used (instead of for example, alternate days).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:35:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Amy K Drahota">
<P>Searching for studies in this area has proved particularly problematic, which is partially due to fact that many words associated with environmental interventions are used in other contexts with different meanings (for example, "art", "floor", "ventilation"), resulting in searches with very low specificity. It is hoped that, most importantly, the sensitivity of the search has been maximised through the wide range of sources searched, however, there is no way to guarantee the capture of all relevant studies. The review does now require updating and 69 studies are listed in <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> from an updated search. It is possible that once further relevant studies have been incorporated into the review findings, that the conclusions may change. All stages of selecting, appraising, and collecting data from studies in this review have been conducted independently by at least two people, in order to minimise bias and improve the robustness of decisions. The protocol for this review was written prior to the release of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), and we have tried to align the review with the updated guidance, which has involved deviating somewhat from the original protocol (See: <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review set out with a very broad question; in particular, including all "health-related outcomes" may be seen as problematic as with multiple analyses there is higher potential for an analysis to be significant by chance alone. This issue, which is a problem related to <I>random error</I> as opposed to <I>bias</I>, is further manifested amongst individual studies, some of which contain multiple tests and many outcomes. We have handled this issue by reporting up to five relevant outcomes for each comparison and grouping the remaining reported outcomes for that intervention under a heading "other outcomes"; where only a minority of studies have reported an outcome, this is also highlighted in the text, so users of this review should be particularly wary of chance findings in these circumstances.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:40:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been a series of other reviews conducted in this area, although the foci of these reviews are not directly comparable to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this current review. A number of reviews have been published (including in the grey literature) covering a broad range of environmental interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2004a</LINK> conducted a review on "the role of the physical environment in the hospital" on patient (of all ages) and staff outcomes, which was later revised and updated (<LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK>). The updated narrative review places more emphasis on the quality of studies than the original, however, the criteria against which studies were assessed is not clear ("each study was evaluated in terms of its research design and methods and whether the journal was peer-reviewed"). The findings additionally draw on a range of evidence (excluding non-English language studies), including qualitative studies, surveys, other literature reviews, and observational studies, and including indirect evidence (e.g. surface and air contamination levels as a proxy for hospital-acquired infections which in turn is linked to reduced length of stay, and studies conducted in non-hospital settings), and multifaceted interventions which have an element of environmental modification.</P>
<P>A series of interventions are advocated in <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK>, which are not supported by the present review either through lack of evidence or interpretation of the findings. These include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Access to nature (e.g. large windows, art, and technological audio-visual distractions) for pain, stress (but with limited evidence on nature art), length of stay, and satisfaction. Some of the studies reported to favour nature in <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK> were included under audiovisual distractions in the present review (as the studies assessed pictures and sounds rather than real-life nature and the findings do not support the use of nature per se due to the choice of comparison groups).</LI>
<LI>Daylight for pain (with limited evidence) and depression (drawing on a number of studies which utilised bright light treatment for depression, which were not included in the present review), and length of stay. The non-significant findings (<LINK REF="STD-Walch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walch 2005</LINK>: pain and anxiety) highlighted in the present review are over-interpreted by <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK> as favouring sunnier rooms.</LI>
<LI>Single-occupancy rooms for infection rates, reduction of stress, and improvement of sleep.</LI>
<LI>Rooms with better air quality, easy-to-clean surfaces, alcohol-based hand-rub dispensers in accessible locations, and carefully maintained water systems for reduction of infection rates.</LI>
<LI>Limited indirect evidence around the influence of noise, lighting, and acuity-adaptable single patient rooms on medical errors.</LI>
<LI>Sound-absorbing ceiling tiles and eliminating or reducing noise sources (e.g. adopting a noiseless paging system) for sleep.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In line with the current review, <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK> found no conclusive evidence linking environmental interventions with reduced falls, and states there is little research assessing wayfinding systems on healthcare outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK> also assessed outcomes related to speech privacy and confidentiality, communication and social support for patients and family, and staff-related outcomes, which were not covered in the present review. On the whole, compared to the present review, <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2008</LINK> is a more inclusive review, with the resulting conclusions reporting more confidently on the positive impact that hospital environments may have on patient outcomes. The present review has more stringent inclusion criteria and assessment of risk of bias and as such does not draw the same degree of positive conclusions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> reviewed studies on nature, daylight, fresh air, and quiet in healthcare settings. <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> included a range of healthcare settings (including non-clinical settings), age groups, and staff and patient health outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> took a more systematic approach than <LINK REF="REF-Ulrich-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrich 2004a</LINK> by setting out the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and relating the findings to a methodological critique and relevance. Like the present review, <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hospital gardens for improved clinical outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> concludes that there is sufficient evidence that viewing nature can reduce stress and pain and that there is solid evidence that ventilation of fresh air is associated with improved health (these conclusions are not fully supported by the present review). <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> reports that there is weak evidence to support the use of indoor plants (the present review included no studies of this nature) and that there is weak and inconclusive evidence for the health benefits of daylight (concurring with the present review findings). <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005</LINK> concludes that there is some evidence to support the promotion of quiet in healthcare settings, and this is supported in part by the present review, the findings of which suggest that the provision of music may reduce the impact of stressful noise.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> also reviewed the evidence in this area. The inclusion/exclusion criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> differ from the current review although there is some overlap in the studies included in each. <LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> only includes two studies on music and one on ocean sounds, but also includes studies that did not meet the methodological inclusion criteria of the present review. <LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> included more studies on multifaceted interventions, which did not meet the criteria of the present review; from these studies <LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> concludes that there is support for the notion that the environment impacts upon patient well-being. With regard to single environmental interventions, the need for further research is suggested. <LINK REF="REF-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> did not incorporate any meta-analyses, and included evidence on televisions, seating arrangements, and layout which did not meet the criteria for the present review. Despite these differences, in very broad terms, the overall conclusions (that there is a general lack of high quality evidence for many environmental interventions) are similar.</P>

<P>The studies included in this review demonstrate that the addition of selected music to the hospital setting, at least does no harm, and may have a beneficial effect in certain circumstances (possibly by way of reducing unpleasant noise), particularly for patient-reported outcomes such as anxiety. There is less evidence to support or refute other environmental changes for patient-related health outcomes. Although the evidence generally supports the premise that environmental interventions do not do any harm (but see conclusions on air quality studies), this does not imply that the benefits of implementing environmental interventions will outweigh the costs. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-18 14:11:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are already many studies reporting on the effects of listening to music in hospital; Further exploration could be made into the impact of music genre, tempo, volume, personal choice, cultural and sociological influences, and underlying mechanisms, to further explore some of the heterogeneity of effects summarised in this review.</P>
<P>It is sometimes argued that it is too logistically complex to conduct studies with good methodological designs on environmental interventions. This review has demonstrated that it is possible to conduct research with good methodological designs (as some studies have been included) however for many environmental interventions these types of studies have yet to take place. The scale of interventions clearly influences the logistical complexity of conducting studies in this field, and the time it takes to organise and run such research; for example, it is easier to allocate patients to receive a music intervention than it is to administer a more permanent environmental structure (such as windows, floors, and ward layout) as an intervention in a research study. However, ongoing research is exploring the feasibility of researching large-scale environmental interventions (e.g. flooring) using a more rigorous research design (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00817869" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00817869</LINK>). Future research efforts in the field should focus on improved methodological design to reduce the risk of bias, and improved reporting. Assessing the effectiveness of environmental interventions is important in order that resources are focused appropriately, and that patients are provided with the best opportunity to be well.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2012-02-02 09:40:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our protocol stated that we would include non-randomised studies, due to feasibility issues often raised when researching the environment. Following review by our contact editor, the decision was made to remove 24 non-randomised CCTs on music. Initially, these studies were included and summarised separately to the 85 included RCTs on music. In general, the CCTs reported similar findings to the RCTs however the quality of the studies was lower. The removal of these studies did not alter the conclusions of the review. Since RCTs are generally feasible in the study of music interventions, and there are so many RCTs exploring the use of music in hospital, it was felt that the CCTs were not providing any further valuable information to the review, which has sought to summarise the best available evidence.</P>
<P>We initially planned to assess heterogeneity through using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with a cut-off point of 50% (i.e. &gt; 50% would be considered heterogeneous). We have since revised this approach (to that specified in the data analysis section of the review) in alignment with revisions to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(version 5; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), in which the use of cut-off points are no longer recommended. Further to the release of the new Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), we have incorporated a 'Risk of bias' assessment utilising the new 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
<P>In our exploration of heterogeneity for studies on music, we conducted subgroup analyses based on whether patients were offered a choice of music or given set pieces. These analyses were post-hoc as they were not planned for in the protocol (although in our protocol we did specify that we would set out to find interventions which provided patient controls over the environment- such as access to lighting and ventilation controls). We felt that it would be useful to explore these variations in the way the music interventions were administered since patient choice and providing patients with a sense of control is often advocated as beneficial.</P>

<P>All patients 18 years and older with a diagnosis of cancer undergoing a BMBx in the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center will be screened for enrolment in the study.

<P>All participants will have pain managed by the physicians responsible for their clinical care as dictated by those physicians. Participants assigned to Nature Sights and Sounds will have Bedscapes fabric panels depicting a scene of a mountain stream placed by the procedure table at a location where it will be visible throughout the procedure. An accompanying audiotape of complementary nature sounds will be played on portable tape players through headphones or speakers. They will be instructed to listen to the tape and look at the nature scene as frequently and for as long as they desire. The standard care group will have pain managed according to current oncology centre protocols but will not be allowed to use the distraction interventions. The Music/Photo group will be played a tape of typical city sounds and will have a poster of a city skyline placed by the procedure table. The city skyline poster will be similar in size to the Bedscapes mural. The skyline image is a daytime photograph without water, trees or other nature elements. The participants will be asked to listen to the music and view the picture during the procedure.</P>

The complexity of the clinic, including unforeseen problems with staff resources in taking blood samples, and the nature of the disease that can unpredictably incapacitate some patients to move from the ward reduced the total number studied to 17 patients. In spite of some patients' willingness to come from the ward to the ground floor where the concert was taking place, some patients felt unwell before the event or might have fallen asleep.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>There may be a risk of bias from selective outcome reporting, given that the results are presented as the proportion of participants whose score on an ordinal variable exceeded a cut-off point (&gt; 7); the data could instead have been reported as mean and SD. Normative data for the HAD suggest &#8804;7 is normal, 8 to 10 is borderline, and &#8805;11 may indicate clinically relevant anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Millar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 1995</LINK>); this presents a rationale for the cut-off.</P>

<P>FRAGRANT PLACEBO: Patients were administered the carrier oil with low-grade essential oils. The carrier oil was sweet almond cold-pressed pure vegetable oil. The low-grade fractionated oils (lavender, bergamot, and cedarwood) were of unknown purity (supplied by Naturistics, Hornsby, Australia). These fractionated oils were diluted with the carrier oil in a ratio of 1:2.<BR/>NON-FRAGRANT PLACEBO: Patients were administered the carrier oil only: sweet almond cold-pressed pure vegetable oil.<BR/>PURE ESSENTIAL OIL: 100% pure essential oils of lavender, bergamot, and cedarwood were administered in a ratio of 2:1:1 (supplied by "In Essence").<BR/>
<BR/>All patients were administered their study treatment via a necklace with a plastic-backed paper bib, donned before radiotherapy treatment each day and removed after exiting the treatment bunker. Three drops of oil were applied to the bib. Typical duration lasted 15-20 minutes. Patients were seated in waiting areas segregated according to study arm allocation to avoid cross-exposure.</P>

<BR/>In a multivariate analysis:<BR/>There were significantly fewer patients with anxiety &gt;7 in the non-fragrant placebo arm than both the essential oil (Odds ratio = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 6.1), and fragrant placebo (Odds ratio = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.1 to 6.7) groups.<BR/>

<P>DESCRIPTION: In-patients, predominantly with leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and malignant non-Hodgkins lymphoma, admitted to the haematology-oncology unit in Bonn, Germany.<BR/>NUMBERS: Over one year there was 4800 bed days in the control group, and 1200 bed days in the air filtration group.<BR/>GENDER: not described.<BR/>AGE: not described.<BR/>ETHNICITY: not described.<BR/>INCLUSION CRITERIA: not described.<BR/>EXCLUSION CRITERIA: not described.</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>AIR FILTRATION: 3 rooms (single or double) were fitted with portable air filtration units (NSA model 7100A/B Environment Air System, National Safety Association Ltd., Memphis, USA). These units have a 95% filtering capacity for particles &gt; 0.3 micrometers. They have two settings (high/low). Flow rate: High = 168, Low = 112 cubic m/hr.<BR/>Noise: High = 57, Low = 55 dB(A). Patients were advised to keep windows closed as much as possible and run the unit on the high setting.<BR/>CONTROL: Standard care, no air filtration units.<BR/>
<BR/>All rooms were naturally ventilated with no HEPA filtration. They were on the 1st floor surrounded by forest. Patients instructed to keep windows closed during periods of neutropenia, wear masks when leaving the room, avoid showering, and use sterile water during other applications. Regular policies for aspergillus prevention included daily disinfection of horizontal surfaces, prohibiting potted plants and flower arrangements within the whole unit.</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS: Counts of cases (confirmed and suspected) were achieved via ward liaison, targeted chart reviews, and consultation with medical staff.<BR/>
<BR/>One confirmed case, and four suspected cases were recorded (5 per 4800 bed days). All were allocated to control areas. No cases were recorded in rooms with air filtration (0 per 1200 bed days). This difference was not significant (Fisher's Exact, P value = 0.33).<BR/>
<BR/>AIR SAMPLING: not a patient outcome.</P>

All were treated at the Institut Jules Bordet between May 1973 and April 1977.<BR/>EXCLUSION CRITERIA: none described.</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>ISOLATION: Patients were isolated in a laminar air flow room. The isolation unit consisted of a normal bed enclosed in a plastic tent. The area available for the patient was about 5 sq metres. Air was pumped vertically through high-efficiency filters positioned on the ceiling. All procedures on the patient were done through plastic gloves on the sides of the tent. All items entering the unit were either gas or steam sterilized, passing through locks irradiated by ultraviolet light. The tent was only opened when absolutely necessary. Any person approaching the isolated patients wore sterile boots, gloves, gown, and mask. Patients remained in isolation until either the bone marrow showed haematologic remission or myeloid proliferation and maturation. The study period ended when the patient was no longer in isolation.<BR/>CONTROL: Patients were kept in single rooms during the entire hospitalisation period. Patients left the rooms only for special examinations, such as radiologic or isotopic investigations.<BR/>
<BR/>All patients received oral non-absorbable antibiotics, and sterile food and liquid. Unclear if cleaning protocols of patients were identical for both groups.</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>BACTERIAL INFECTIONS: Fungal cultures of stools were performed at least once a week. Data is reported as a count of the number of patients in which suppression of bacterial growth from stool cultures was achieved. Cultures were also obtained from the nose, gingiva, throat, ear, and axilla. Results report the number of days with infection (per 1000 days with severe neutropenia).<BR/>MORTALITY: A count is provided of the number of fatal infections.<BR/>REMISSION: A count is provided of the number of patients in complete and "partial" remission. Data extracted for complete remission.<BR/>ADVERSE EVENTS: The paper reports on a number of people removed from isolation due to poor psychologic tolerance.</P>

Data reported as the number of acquisitions, and the rate per 100 patient-week. The number of tetracycline-resistant strains of Staph. aureus and delayed acquisitions was also determined.<BR/>WOUND SEPSIS: A wound was regarded as infected (1) when pus was visible to the naked eye, or (2) if a fluid exudate was present and pathogenic bacteria were isolated from it.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTION: 132 elderly out-patients admitted to the emergency department, in Ohio, USA.<BR/>NUMBERS: Chair group = 66, Gurney group = 66.<BR/>AGE, mean (SD): Chair group = 77 (7.2), Gurney group = 78 (6.7) years old.<BR/>GENDER (male/female): Chair group = 28/38, Gurney group = 27/39.<BR/>ETHNICITY: not described.<BR/>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Ambulatory outpatients; 65 years or older; able to sit upright, transfer, and engage in normal conversation.<BR/>EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Refused participation; too ill to participate (as determined by the Emergency Department attending physician); unable to follow the instructions to remain in the chair or gurney and use the call light for any transfers (determined by the study nurse).</P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>CHAIR GROUP: Remained on the gurney until initial physician and nursing evaluations complete. Patients were then assisted to a reclining chair. Patients were told "it is now time to move to the chair" and if they asked why, they were told they had the option of now moving to the chair. Patients were assisted to a position of comfort. Patients can sit on the reclining chairs with the hips and knees flexed.<BR/>GURNEY GROUP: Remained on the gurney (the Emergency Department bed) throughout. The gurney has a thin foam mattress. Patients were assisted to a position of comfort.</P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>PAIN: "The study nurse specifically instructed patients to rate pain associated with the gurney, rather than other sources." Measured on a NRS at three time points (time 0 = baseline; time 1 = one hour after randomisation; time 2 = two hours after randomisation). This outcome was dichotomised as favourable outcome (yes/no). A favourable outcome was considered as the patient having no pain at time 0 or time 1, or a decrease in pain from time 0 to time 1. An unfavourable outcome was defined as an increase in pain from time 0 to time 1, or no change in pain score if the patient complained of pain at time 0.<BR/>SATISFACTION: Satisfaction with the gurney or chair was measured on a VAS at the time of discharge or after two hours (which ever came first).</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>SDs for satisfaction were estimated from the 95% confidence interval (1.4, 2.8), assuming 66 patients per group.<BR/>

<P>ANALGESIC CONSUMPTION: obtained via chart extraction and standardised to morphine equivalent mg/hr.<BR/>PAIN: Recorded on post-operative day one and on the day of discharge via McGill Pain Questionnaire. On discharge those in the bright rooms reported less pain although this was not significant (P value = 0.058).<BR/>DEPRESSION: The Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale on first and last post-operative day. There were no differences between groups.<BR/>ANXIETY: Measured using the POMS anxiety scale on first and last post-operative day. There were no differences between groups.<BR/>STRESS: Measured using the Perceived Stress Scale on first and last post-operative day. Patients in the bright rooms reported significantly less stress on day of discharge (P value = 0.035).</P>

<P>I have composed music designed for mental health with improvement in concentration and emotional well being for those under stress, employment , businesses, hospitals and doctors offices. Anecdotally there has been uniform success. I invite you to <A HREF="http://cdbaby.com">cdbaby.com</A>, A Voice From heaven. We are looking for joint projects to use the music in a setting for better outcomes</P>
<P>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2014-11-13 13:25:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>Thank you for your comment and interest in our review. You may have noted that our review includes many (85) studies assessing the effects of music. As well, there are approximately 40 systematic reviews related to the effects music and music therapy in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews &#8211; those co-authored by Joke Bradtmay particularly interest you. With this in mind, researchers of future studies in the area need to carefully consider what they will add to the evidence base. Our review&#8217;s section &#8216;Implications for research&#8217; suggests some avenues of research in the field. In addition, any future research should aim to minimise bias (i.e. by addressing the risk of bias criteria used in Cochrane Reviews), and especially, to consider which outcomes to include. Since many music studies include a plethora of outcomes (and risk reporting only the significant ones), we would like to see studies specify in advance the outcomes they plan to measure, and report on all of these, regardless of the direction of the results. Understandably, the outcomes of choice may differ depending on the population studied, but we would advise future research to consider both patient-reported and physiologically measured outcomes; the current evidence seems to suggest that though music may improve patient-reported outcomes, this may not translate into measurable physiological effects. As in all research, transparency and conduct of the highest standard matters most, regardless of affiliation or any vested interest in the results. We wish you well in your partner search and hope you find a suitable opportunity to empirically assess the effectiveness of your music.</P>
