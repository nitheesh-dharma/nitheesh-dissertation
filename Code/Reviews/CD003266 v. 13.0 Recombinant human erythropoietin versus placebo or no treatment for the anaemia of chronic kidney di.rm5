<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-30 16:52:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Anaemia (low red blood cells) is a common complication of kidney failure. Anaemia causes some of the tiredness and problems associated with kidney failure. Manufactured erythropoietin (a hormone that increases red blood cell production) improves this, and is used by people on dialysis (treatment from an artificial kidney machine). This review found it can also reduce anaemia for people with kidney failure who are not yet on dialysis. It is not known if erythropoietin use can delay the need for dialysis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-18 14:09:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in dialysis patients has been shown to be highly effective in terms of correcting anaemia and improving quality of life. There is debate concerning the benefits of rHuEPO use in predialysis patients which may accelerate the deterioration of kidney function. However the opposing view is that if rHuEPO is as effective in predialysis patients, improving the patient's sense of well-being may result in the onset of dialysis being delayed. This is an update of a review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2005.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-04 15:12:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The objective of this review was to ascertain the effects of rHuEPO treatment in predialysis patients primarily in terms of the timing of the onset of dialysis; but also that predialysis rHuEPO: 1) corrects haemoglobin/haematocrit (markers of anaemia); 2) improves quality of life; and 3) is not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events such as hastening of the onset of dialysis, increased hypertension, clotting of arterio-venous fistulae or seizures.</P>

<P>Only published data were used. Quality assessment was performed by two assessors independently.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-18 14:26:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Nineteen studies (enrolling 993 participants) were included. Due to the age of the included studies (most performed prior to 2000) the risk of bias was judged to be unclear in the majority of the studies for most of the domains. There was an improvement in haemoglobin (MD 1.90 gm/L, 95% CI -2.34 to -1.47) and haematocrit (MD 9.85%, 95% CI 8.35 to 11.34) with treatment and a decrease in the number of patients requiring blood transfusions (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83). The data from studies reporting quality of life or exercise capacity demonstrated an improvement in the treatment group. Most of the measures of progression of kidney disease showed no statistically significant difference. No significant increase in adverse events was identified.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 12:25:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Treatment with rHuEPO in predialysis patients corrects anaemia, avoids the requirement for blood transfusions and also improves quality of life and exercise capacity. We were unable to assess the effects of rHuEPO on progression of kidney disease, delay in the onset of dialysis or adverse events. Based on the current evidence, decisions on the putative benefits in terms of quality of life are worth the extra costs of predialysis rHuEPO need careful evaluation.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-01-18 14:24:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-04 12:24:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Anaemia is often an associated condition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is a direct relationship between the severity of the anaemia and the decline in kidney function (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1991</LINK>). This anaemia is a source of significant morbidity causing symptoms such as lack of energy, breathlessness, dizziness, angina, poor appetite and decreased exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-EPO-Study-Group-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian EPO Study Group 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundin 1989</LINK>). The main cause of this anaemia is a decreased production of erythropoietin, a naturally occurring hormone mainly produced by the kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1994</LINK>). Much of the impaired quality of life and morbidity suffered by patients with CKD may be a consequence of this anaemia and it may have a major impact on their sense of well-being as well as impairing their ability to work and affecting their social and sexual lives. In the past, iron and folate were the main treatments for this condition and blood transfusions, with their associated risks of transmission of infection and induction of cytotoxic antibodies, which could jeopardise a future kidney transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1990</LINK>), were used sparingly. In 1983 the cloning of the human gene for erythropoietin was achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1985</LINK>), production of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) followed and by 1986 the efficacy of rHuEPO treatment in dialysis patients was first demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Winearls-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winearls 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although treatment with rHuEPO in dialysis patients has been shown to be highly effective in terms of correcting anaemia and improving quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-EPO-Study-Group-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian EPO Study Group 1990</LINK>), there is debate concerning the benefits of rHuEPO use in predialysis patients (patients with CKD anticipated to start renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the near future). Nonetheless there is increasing use of erythropoietin in predialysis patients and professional guidelines are increasingly recommending its use. Anaemia may be a cause of significant morbidity in such patients and substantial numbers of the predialysis population may benefit from treatment with rHuEPO. Its use may enable patients to carry on working longer and, importantly, by improving the patients' sense of well-being could delay the onset of dialysis. In a survey of 20 investigators in rHuEPO clinical trials and 250 randomly selected nephrologists it was estimated that by improving symptoms of anaemia, rHuEPO therapy could delay the initiation of dialysis for an average of 3.7 months (<LINK REF="REF-Sheingold-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheingold 1990</LINK>). This could have important cost implications which need to be taken into account in an economic evaluation should such a delay exist. The converse opinion, based on results from animal studies, is that rHuEPO may cause or worsen hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1985</LINK>) and potentially cause an accelerated deterioration in kidney function hence bringing forward initiation of dialysis. Based on work with partially nephrectomised rats, <LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1985</LINK> suggested that anaemia may have a protective effect on the development of progressive kidney failure and could be an adaptive mechanism. One small clinical study suggested a similar detrimental effect of rHuEPO on kidney function (<LINK REF="REF-Muirhead-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muirhead 1994</LINK>). Other adverse effects which have also been attributed to the use of rHuEPO are clotting of the arterio-venous fistula which provides access to the circulation for haemodialysis, elevation of blood pressure and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The debate about the effectiveness of treating predialysis patients with rHuEPO combined with the perceived increased cost of using this expensive drug may have led to a reluctance to use rHuEPO in this group of patients.</P>
<P>This review aimed to determine the effects of treating the anaemia of CKD with rHuEPO in predialysis patients. Studies evaluating newer erythropoietic stimulating agents (darbepoetin, CERA) have not been included as they are the subject of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2014</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-12-30 16:07:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>All electronically-derived citations and abstracts were read by two assessors. All studies, relevant to the use of erythropoietin in kidney failure which might possibly be an RCT or a quasi-RCT, were identified. Assessment and identification was designed to be sensitive and not precise (specific). This was to avoid missing possible RCTs/quasi-RCTs. The full published copies of all identified relevant studies were retrieved.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-01-04 12:25:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The full published hard copies of studies identified through electronic searching and by our other methods of study ascertainment were assessed for subject relevance, eligibility for inclusion in our review and methodological quality. A standard form, which recorded details of quality of randomisation (particularly security of concealment of randomisation), blinding, description of withdrawals/dropouts and numbers lost to follow-up and whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible on the available data, was used for this quality assessment. If it was unclear from the published study whether it met the methodological inclusion criteria the authors were contacted. These studies remained excluded unless the authors confirmed that our eligibility criteria had been met. Assessment was undertaken by two assessors independently, one of whom was a clinician (nephrologist). If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion a third assessor made the final decision. The assessors were not blind to author, institution or journal. Where appropriate, studies were translated prior to methodological assessment.</P>
<P>Studies which met the criteria for methodological quality and subject relevance for this review passed to the stage of data abstraction. Data relevant to the pre-stated outcome measures, the characteristics of the study, interventions and participants were abstracted by a single assessor on to a data abstraction form generated for this review. Data relevant to study methodology had already been abstracted onto the quality assessment form. These data were then, where appropriate, entered by a single researcher into Review Manager. No raw data were sought from the authors. Apart from translation by the authors and ascertainment of study methodology all data were obtained from the published paper or abstract.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-12-30 16:38:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Where appropriate, data were quantitatively combined using meta-analysis to determine the typical effect of the intervention. We calculated a relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and a mean difference (MD) or a standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data. A random effects model was used for analyses of both dichotomous and continuous data. Following the convention of the Cochrane Collaboration, all comparisons were framed in terms of unfavourable events such as adverse symptoms or death. RRs of less than one therefore favour the experimental treatment while RRs greater than one favour the control treatment. Ninety-five per cent confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived for all comparisons.</P>

Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eschbach-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Eschbach 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1988</LINK>) formed part of a larger multicentre study (<LINK REF="STD-Teehan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Teehan 1991</LINK>). If an outcome measure was common to both a small study and the multicentre study, only the results from the multicentre study were included in the meta-analysis (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>); the smaller studies were analyses of individual centres&#8217; data.</P>
<P>Ten studies were conducted in the USA, one in Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1992</LINK>), and one in Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Kuriyama-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kuriyama 1997</LINK>). The majority of studies had few participants and were of short duration (8 to 12 weeks) not long enough to assess the effects on the progression of kidney disease. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuriyama-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kuriyama 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1994</LINK>) were of longer duration between 36 weeks and one year, however <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1995</LINK> only included 17 participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2005 review update</HEADING>
<P>For the 2005 update of the review, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ganguli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ganguli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK>) were identified for inclusion, and 10 were excluded either because they did not fit the inclusion criteria of the review or it was unclear how patients had been allocated to groups. This brought the total number of included studies to 15. For the update some authors (<LINK REF="STD-Mignon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mignon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK>) were contacted to seek clarification on how patients were allocated to groups and for data which could be included in the review. Teplan confirmed patients were randomised and that <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2001b</LINK> was a separate sample of participants from <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK>. No response was received for Mignon and this study was excluded as it appeared both groups received erythropoietin. Unfortunately no additional data were received from <LINK REF="STD-Ganguli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ganguli 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2001b</LINK>.</P>
<P>These new studies were conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Ganguli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ganguli 2003</LINK>) and the Czech Republic (<LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK>). The number of participants ranged from 36 to 186 and the duration of the studies was six months to three years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2016 review update</HEADING>
<P>This update found an additional four studies (four reports) (<LINK REF="STD-Akizawa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Akizawa 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2006e" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2006e</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004b</LINK>). Three studies were only available as abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Akizawa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Akizawa 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2006e" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2006e</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004b</LINK>). Therefore a total of 19 studies have been included in this review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>These new studies were conducted in Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Akizawa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Akizawa 1993</LINK>), Korea (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2006e" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2006e</LINK>), Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2008</LINK>), and Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004b</LINK>). The number of participants ranged from 40 to 107 and the duration of the studies was 12 weeks to 21 months.</P>
<P>Because the benefit of EPO therapy is now established for patients with CKD not yet on dialysis, further updates of this review with the addition of studies comparing EPO with placebo or no treatment are unnecessary and therefore this review will no longer be updated.</P>

During the 48 weeks of follow up the control group showed a significant decrease in physical function (P = 0.03); those receiving rHuEPO showed significant increases in energy (P = 0.045) and physical function (P = 0.015).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-01-18 14:12:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>This review has generated no clear evidence that rHuEPO treatment has either a beneficial or adverse effect on the progression of CKD or on the timing of initiation of dialysis. Though a formal meta-analysis, of quality of life and exercise capacity measures were not possible, all the studies reporting these outcomes demonstrated statistically significant differences favouring treatment with rHuEPO. There was no statistically significant result as regards deterioration in blood pressure control or seizure necessitating withdrawal of treatment, however study duration was short and the confidence intervals wide. The combined results from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Teehan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Teehan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1990</LINK>) provide no evidence that rHuEPO treatment was associated with seizures although the short duration of most of the studies resulted in very few events. The meta-analysis of four studies did not indicate a significant increase in the number of participants in whom antihypertensives were introduced, although as the confidence interval is wide this could not be ruled out. The increase in the use of antihypertensives in some of the studies could have been as a result of the higher doses of rHuEPO used in some of the earlier studies, lower doses are now used. The review also generated convincing evidence that predialysis rHuEPO does correct renal anaemia and reduces blood transfusion requirements.</P>
<P>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was not one of the predetermined outcomes of this review. Though it may be an independent predictor of mortality in participants with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Harnett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harnett 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1996</LINK>) it is clearly a surrogate marker. There is no convincing evidence that reversing or delaying the progression of LVH has an impact on mortality, morbidity or quality of life. If such evidence becomes available it would support LVH becoming an outcome measure in future RCTs and systematic reviews in this area.</P>
<P>GFR was statistically significantly higher at the end of the study period in the rHuEPO treated group. This result was driven mainly by <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK> included in this first update. The difference of 2.5 mL/min may however not be clinically significant. In addition the numbers are still small and the GFR was higher at the beginning of <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK> in the rHuEPO group and when we calculated the relative risk this difference was statistically significant. This imbalance was not incorporated into the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>It is regrettable that none of the included RCTs continued follow-up beyond commencement of dialysis. It is possible that participants whose haemoglobin/haematocrit has been partially corrected by rHuEPO may have less morbidity, less hospitalisation, less initial rHuEPO requirements and consume less health care resources around the period of dialysis commencement.</P>
<P>A number of characteristics of the included studies make it difficult to demonstrate either clear evidence of benefit or lack of benefit of predialysis rHuEPO. Many of the studies were of short duration not long enough to assess the effects on the progression of kidney disease and included small numbers of randomised participants. Participants were not equally distributed between treatment and placebo groups in 7/15 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eschbach-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Eschbach 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuriyama-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kuriyama 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teehan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Teehan 1991</LINK>). The way data were reported in many of the studies included in this review (without means or measures of dispersion) made incorporation into a meta-analysis impossible and thus the statistical power of combined patient numbers could not always be utilised. <LINK REF="STD-Teplan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teplan 2003</LINK> was one of the largest studies and longest duration of 36 months, and contributed to the statistically significant result in the GFR favouring EPO, although clinical significance is questionable. There was no mention of any of the participants progressing to dialysis, presumably because their kidney failure was less advanced, a follow-up study of these participants to start of dialysis would be interesting.</P>
<P>With the exception of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuriyama-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kuriyama 1997</LINK>) which included participants with diabetes, the studies generally excluded participants with significant comorbidity. The results of this review may not be generalisable to the present predialysis patient population.</P>
<P>This review also demonstrated the potential pitfall of double-counting randomised participants in systematic reviews when some individual centres in a multi-centre RCT publish their data separately in addition to their inclusion in the full report of the complete RCT. All the reports from multi-centre RCTs should clearly describe the involvement of all centres and highlight any previous or potential future publications derived from the RCT.</P>
<P>In summary there was a marked improvement in measures of anaemia with the treatment and a decrease in the number of participants requiring blood transfusion. Though difficult to summarise, the data from all studies which reported quality of life or exercise capacity demonstrated an improvement in the rHuEPO group. Only one of the measures of progression of kidney disease (GFR) (when a summary statistic was calculated) demonstrated a statistically significantly difference but with questionable clinical significance. Hence there is no evidence from this review of the hypothesised delay in requirement for RRT or of a further deterioration in kidney function attributable to rHuEPO treatment. The requirement for antihypertensive treatment appears not to be increased by rHuEPO therapy and there was no other statistically significant increase in adverse events.</P>
<P>The addition of four studies in 2016 did not alter the conclusions of the review.</P>

<P>The benefits of rHuEPO treatment in predialysis participants are that it corrects anaemia and avoids the requirement for blood transfusions. In the long term the critical question as to whether treatment with rHuEPO either speeds or delays the onset of RRT remains unanswered.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-04 09:57:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>A future RCT to look specifically at whether rHuEPO can delay or hasten RRT in patients with chronic kidney failure is required. Nephrology is a low volume specialty and multicentre studies are therefore necessary to recruit sufficient numbers to achieve acceptable statistical power. Further RCTs should be designed to be large enough and of long enough duration to address this question adequately. These studies could also examine the proposition that a patient with a higher haemoglobin is in better health and better able to cope with the commencement of dialysis when it is eventually necessary. Hospitalisation duration for initiation of dialysis, hospitalisation rates and mortality for the first three months of RRT should provide further relatively hard end-points. Considering the demonstrable effectiveness of rHuEPO in improving haemoglobin it may be impossible to blind health care providers effectively in such a study.</P>
