<P>No evidence was found to indicate that the routine measurement of serum drug concentrations to inform drug dose adjustments is superior to drug dose adjustments made on clinical grounds alone in newly-diagnosed epilepsy patients treated with a single drug: carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone.

<P>We based this review on published aggregate data. The main outcomes measured were the proportions of patients achieving a 12-month remission from seizures, reporting adverse effects, and being withdrawn from the treatment they had been randomised to receive. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one study met the inclusion criteria for the review. In this open study, 180 patients with newly-diagnosed, untreated epilepsy were randomised to treatment with the antiepileptic drug selected by their physician either with or without therapeutic drug serum level monitoring as an aid to dosage adjustments. The antiepileptic drugs used were carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone. A 12-month remission from seizures was achieved by 60% of the patients randomised to therapeutic drug monitoring (intervention group) and by 61% in the control group. A total of 56% in the intervention group and 58% in the control group were seizure free during the last 12 months of follow up.

<P>We found no clear evidence to support routine antiepileptic drug serum concentration measurement with the aim of reaching predefined target ranges for the optimisation of treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy with antiepileptic drug monotherapy.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-13 10:12:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2007) on 'Therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy'.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder characterised by spontaneously occurring recurrent epileptic seizures. It has been estimated that more than 40 million people in the world have epilepsy; the main treatment is with antiepileptic drugs. The aim of treatment is to prevent seizures without causing side effects. The treatment of epilepsy needs to be individualised with respect to both choice of drugs and drug dosage. The latter became apparent during the 1960s when methods for measuring serum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were developed (<LINK REF="REF-Buchtal-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchtal 1960</LINK>). The serum concentration of an antiepileptic drug varies markedly between patients given the same dosage; the reason for this is that people differ in their ability to absorb, distribute, metabolise and excrete drugs. These processes are summarised in the term 'pharmacokinetics'. The rate at which these pharmacokinetic processes proceed may be influenced by factors such as the formulation of the drug, concurrent disease, concomitant medication and genetic variables of the individual patient. Thus, many factors contribute to differences in pharmacokinetics and to the individual variability in the serum concentration of a drug. As a consequence of this variability, there may be a wide variation in response to a drug given in a standard dose. Some patients may suffer from poor efficacy whereas others may experience toxic effects unless the dosage is individualised.</P>
<P>Phenytoin was the drug of choice for most seizure types when drug level measurements were introduced in the 1960s and it was found to exhibit particularly complex dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. As a consequence, it is extremely difficult to predict the effect of a dose change of this drug. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated a correlation between the concentration of phenytoin in serum and its therapeutic and toxic effects, thus measuring the serum concentration of phenytoin was soon established as a guide to individualised dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Kutt-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kutt 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kutt-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kutt 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lund-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1974</LINK>). Since then, drug level monitoring (therapeutic drug monitoring) has been established as a routine aid to optimising treatment with other antiepileptic drugs. The goal of therapeutic drug monitoring is to optimise a patient's clinical outcome by managing the medication regimen, assisted by the measurement of drug concentrations. In general, therapeutic drug monitoring is considered to be of potential value when there is a need for individualised dosing owing to marked inter-individual differences in drug response when such differences are accounted for by variations in pharmacokinetics, and when it is difficult to monitor drug treatment by direct observation of the therapeutic response and adverse effects, as is sometimes the case in epilepsy. Although most antiepileptic drugs do not share the problems of dose-dependent kinetics that phenytoin has, many display pronounced inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics that suggest the need for individualised dosing. Furthermore, the serum concentration of many antiepileptic drugs can be affected by interactions with other drugs. Therapeutic drug monitoring may facilitate the identification of such interactions.</P>
<P>The concept of therapeutic drug monitoring rests on the assumption that drug concentration correlates better with clinical effects than dose. For some antiepileptic drugs, target ranges of serum concentration have been determined. These are drug concentrations known to be associated with a high probability of seizure control and low risk of toxicity. However, comparatively few studies have been designed specifically to explore the relationship between serum concentrations and effects of antiepileptic drugs, and the documentation in this respect for many of the drugs is scarce (<LINK REF="REF-Tomson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomson 2000</LINK>). Provided there is a distinct concentration-effect relationship within the individual, therapeutic drug monitoring may be justifiable to control for changes due to drug interactions. This is also possible in the absence of a defined target drug concentration range. It is, however, likely that the value of therapeutic drug monitoring will vary with the different antiepileptic drugs, depending on their pharmacological properties.</P>
<P>The therapeutic drug monitoring service may vary in its methods. Drug concentrations can be measured in specimens other than serum, such as saliva, while analytical methods with varying specificities may also be used. Moreover, there are different ways in which the results of the analysis are presented to the treating physician. This may be just the crude drug concentration or, in some settings, it may be part of a more comprehensive pharmacokinetic service with suggestions for dose adjustments.</P>
<P>Given the heterogeneity in the concept of therapeutic drug monitoring and in the pharmacological characteristics of antiepileptic drugs, it is not surprising that the use of therapeutic drug monitoring varies markedly and that we lack consensus concerning the value of its application in epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 1987</LINK>). The focus of this review is, therefore, on studies assessing the extent to which therapeutic drug monitoring contributes towards the greater effectiveness of antiepileptic drug treatment.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People with epilepsy who were receiving treatment with antiepileptic drugs as monotherapy. The review included patients of all ages with different seizure types and the use of all established antiepileptic drugs to prevent seizures. Two separate cohorts of patients were to be analysed: <BR/>(1) patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy starting treatment;<BR/>(2) patients with established epilepsy on continuous treatment with antiepileptic drugs. <BR/>Children (under 16 years of age) and adults were to be analysed separately, if sufficient data were available. </P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The use of therapeutic drug monitoring to optimise antiepileptic drug therapy versus drug therapy without guidance by therapeutic drug monitoring. </P>
<P>It is recognised that antiepileptic drug levels may be analysed in many ways. Drug concentrations may be measured in different specimens, such as serum, plasma or saliva. Total as well as unbound serum concentrations may be analysed, and various analytical methods can be used. Moreover, the results of the analysis can be presented to the treating physician in different ways: as the actual drug concentration, as the drug level together with a suggested target range, or together with an interpretation with suggestions for dose adjustments as part of a more comprehensive pharmacokinetic service. </P>
<P>In this review any measurement of antiepileptic drug concentration that was made in order to assist the treating physician in his or her therapeutic decision making was to be considered. </P>

<BR/>(1) The two cohorts, patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy starting treatment and patients with established epilepsy on continuous treatment with antiepileptic drugs, were analysed separately; a separate analysis for children and adults was also undertaken. <BR/>(2) The primary analysis was to include therapeutic drug monitoring of all drugs. However, it was envisaged that the impact of drug monitoring may vary with different drugs, depending at least in part on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs. Subgroup analyses were, therefore, undertaken separately for the different drugs. <BR/>(3) Clinical heterogeneity between trials was to be assessed by comparing the following: <BR/>(a) Patient characteristics: age; type of epilepsy; aetiology of epilepsy.<BR/>(b) Therapeutic drug monitoring method: measurement of bound or unbound drug concentrations; nature of specimens analysed (for example, saliva versus plasma); relation of timing of taking sample for analysis and dosing; whether the therapeutic drug monitoring results given to treating physicians included interpretation of results and suggestions for dose adjustments versus provision of crude drug levels only; whether the laboratory analysing drug levels was taking part in a quality control program or not. <BR/>(4) Statistical heterogeneity was to be assessed using the chi-squared test for heterogeneity and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Provided no significant heterogeneity was found, results were to be summarised in a fixed-effect meta-analysis. <BR/>(5) The primary analysis was by intention to treat, including all patients randomised to treatment guided by therapeutic drug monitoring or treatment without drug monitoring, whether the randomised patients completed the evaluation period or not. <BR/>(6) Dichotomous data was to be presented as odds ratios and relative risks, and analysed using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. <BR/>(7) Sensitivity analyses were to be made including all studies and also only those using adequate methods of randomisation. </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Only one prospective randomised study was identified that met the main inclusion criteria of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Jannuzzi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jannuzzi 2000</LINK>). The focus of that study was on the clinical impact of therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy. One hundred and eighty patients, aged 6 to 65 years, with untreated partial or idiopathic generalised non-absence epilepsy, and who had a history of at least two seizures in the previous month, were enrolled in this unblinded, prospective parallel-group study. The ability of prospective participants to comply with the study protocol was evaluated and informed consent obtained from the patients or their guardians. All participants who met the eligibility criteria were randomised through a central office into two groups using a stratification procedure aimed at ensuring a balanced distribution of different types of epilepsy between groups. All participants were prescribed the antiepileptic drug selected as the most appropriate by their physician, including carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone. In one group, dosage was adjusted to achieve a steady-state serum antiepileptic drug concentration within a target range during a period of three months or less, whereas, in the other groups, dosage was adjusted on purely clinical grounds aimed at achieving optimal seizure control over the shortest reasonable period. </P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were: pregnancy; history of drug or alcohol abuse; previous treatment with any antiepileptic drug; presence of any known progressive disease or a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy; absence epilepsy; and epileptic encephalopathy.</P>
<P>The target ranges used were 10 to 20 µg/ml (40 to 80 µM) for phenytoin, 15 to 40 µg/ml (64 to 172 µM) for phenobarbital, 4 to 11 µg/ml (17 to 46 µM) for carbamazepine, and 40 to 100 µg/ml (280 to 700 µM) for valproate. For primidone treated patients, only metabolically derived phenobarbital was used for therapeutic monitoring purposes. Blood samples for determination of antiepileptic drug levels were collected in both groups in a similar way but the results were not made available to the treating physician in one of the groups. If no satisfactory response was achieved after 6 to 12 months of treatment, and the physician thought that knowledge of serum drug concentration was necessary to continue treatment, patients randomised to the control group could be crossed over to the intervention group. However, only one patient crossed over, after one month. Hence, this is not likely to have had a significant effect on the overall results of the study. Patients were followed up for 24 months or until a change in treatment strategy was clinically indicated. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete seizure remission during the previous 12 months of follow up and the analyses based on the intention-to-treat population. </P>
<P>One additional prospective randomised study assessing the effect of monitoring plasma anticonvulsant levels was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_scher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fröscher 1981</LINK>). In this, 127 outpatients with epilepsy were randomly assigned to two groups. In one, the treating physician was not informed of the results of plasma concentration determinations, whereas, in the other, plasma levels were reported and the treating physician was asked to try to keep plasma concentrations within a therapeutic range. Each patient was followed for one year. This study included patients with chronic epilepsy and those who had been on treatment for a considerable time before enrolment. However, this study was excluded from the review since the majority of patients were treated with a combination of different antiepileptic drugs (on average 2.5 per patient). In all, only 14 patients taking part in this study received monotherapy. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The only study that met our criteria was an open, prospective randomised study with a parallel-group design. The randomisation procedure was adequate and the two treatment groups comparable with respect to age, seizure frequency and type of epilepsy. The study design was open, but there would have been considerable practical problems associated with blinding procedures, and this is not likely to have had a major impact on the results. The selected primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of participants achieving complete seizure remission during the previous 12 months, is relevant and the two-year follow up was adequate. The sample size calculations were based on the assumption of a 50% seizure freedom rate in the control group and in the intervention group a 25% absolute improvement corresponding to a 75% seizure freedom rate. A sample size of 146 patients was thus considered adequate for a power of 80% at the P &lt; 0.05 level. The investigators nevertheless enrolled 180 patients. The reasons for this are not declared. Although the expected seizure response rate in the control group was close to the one observed in the study, the assumed effect of therapeutic drug monitoring on the primary efficacy outcome variable could be considered as unrealistically high. The limited number of patients may thus have contributed to the failure to demonstrate an effect of the intervention in the present study. Additionally, although the potential value of drug level monitoring is likely to vary between drugs, comparisons were made between the two groups regardless of type of treatment. Most patients in both the intervention group (52/93; 56%) and the control group (48/87; 55%) were treated with carbamazepine, while the number receiving other antiepileptic drugs was much lower. A substantial proportion (64/180; 36%) of the enrolled patients exited the study prematurely. Of these, 43 were lost to follow up. However, the proportion of completers was similar in the two groups, and the analyses in the study of Januzzi et al used the intention-to-treat population.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The proportion of patients who achieved a 12-month remission from seizures was 60% (56/93) (95% CI 50 to 70) in the group with treatment supported by drug monitoring data, which was not significantly different from the 61% (53/87) (95% CI 50 to 71) in the control group, relative risk (RR) 0.99 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.25). As for the primary endpoint of the study, seizure freedom rates during the last 12 months of follow up, the results were also very close: 56% (52/93) (95% CI 45 to 66) in the intervention group and 58% (50/87) (95% CI 48 to 68) in the control group (not statistically significant), RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.26). Adverse effects were reported in 45 of 93 patients (48%, 95% CI 38 to 59) in the drug level monitoring group compared with 41 of the 87 in the control group (47%, 95% CI 36 to 58) (not statistically significant), RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.11). The rates of the most frequently reported types of side effects (somnolence, dizziness, headache, irritability and fatigue) were also very similar in the two groups. Among the 93 patients in the intervention group, 58 (62%, 95% CI 52 to 72) completed the two-year follow up compared with 58/87 (67%, 95% CI 56 to 76) in the control group, RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.16). Of the 64 patients who exited the study prematurely, 43 were lost to follow up, 10 exited due to insufficient efficacy and/or adverse events, and 11 for other reasons.</P>
<P>Exclusion of all patients who did not complete the two-year follow up from the analysis of the primary endpoint of the study, seizure freedom rates during the last 12 months of follow up, resulted in a RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.19). </P>
<P>
<I>Serum drug levels </I>
<BR/>The mean serum concentrations of carbamazepine and valproate at nearly all time points were within the predefined target ranges for patients in both groups; there were no significant differences between the groups in this respect. Serum phenobarbital levels below the target range were twice as common in the control group as in the intervention group, but the numbers of participants were low. After the last dosage adjustment, general serum drug levels outside the target range were found in 6% of those participants in the drug monitored group compared with 22% of the control participants (P &lt; 0.01). Of the patients who continued to have seizures during the last 12 months of follow up, 1 out of 10 in the therapeutic drug monitoring group and 4 out of 11 in the control group had serum drug levels below the target range. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has demonstrated the lack of relevant randomised studies assessing the impact of therapeutic drug monitoring in efforts to optimise the drug treatment of newly-diagnosed epilepsy. The only identified study meeting our inclusion criteria provides no evidence for the effectiveness of the routine use of therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptic drugs during the first two years after the initiation of monotherapy treatment for patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy. This does not exclude the possibility that therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptic drugs may be useful in individual patients, in other stages of epilepsy, in patients on polytherapy or in other specific clinical situations. Nor do the results of this included study exclude some impact of therapeutic drug monitoring on the outcome of the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy. </P>
<P>The study failed to demonstrate a difference between the two treatment groups, with and without monitoring, but was powered to detect only an improvement in response rate from 50% to 75%. More realistic, less pronounced effects may still be of clinical relevance. Such effects are not excluded, although they may seem unlikely considering the very similar rates of seizure remission and side effects in the two treatment groups. Furthermore, although it is likely that the value of therapeutic drug monitoring varies between drugs, owing to their individual pharmacokinetic properties, all antiepileptic drugs were analysed together in the identified study. Phenytoin, the antiepileptic drug for which therapeutic drug monitoring is potentially most important, was used by a small fraction of the patients and was unevenly distributed between the two groups. Additionally, although a two-year follow up is unusually long for an intervention study in epilepsy, it should be recognised that treatment continues for considerably longer for the vast majority of patients. Potential long-term benefits of therapeutic drug monitoring have, therefore, not been addressed in the included study. The risk of chronic toxicity and the management of late treatment failure are examples of situations where drug level monitoring might play a role that could not be assessed in the present study. A further special feature of the included study is the key role of the target ranges of antiepileptic drug serum concentrations. In the intervention group, dosage was adjusted to achieve serum concentrations within predefined target ranges. The outcome thus partly depended on the validity of the selected target ranges. Their relevance for patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy has in fact been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Tomson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomson 2000</LINK>) and therapeutic monitoring is, therefore, often employed without strict adherence to target ranges but rather using the individual patient's optimal drug concentration as a reference for future therapeutic decisions. Such use of drug-level monitoring has not been evaluated in the included study. Neither can it be said that therapeutic drug monitoring would not prove more useful as an aid for physicians who are less experienced in the treatment of epilepsy and thus less skilled in individualising drug dosage on clinical grounds alone. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The result of this review, with only one study meeting our inclusion criteria, provides no clear evidence to support the routine use of therapeutic drug monitoring for the optimisation of treatment with antiepileptic drugs of patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy. However, benefits of therapeutic drug monitoring in newly-diagnosed patients cannot be excluded, neither can its usefulness in special situations or in selected patients, although strict evidence is lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review has demonstrated the shortage of data from randomised controlled studies concerning the effectiveness of using therapeutic drug monitoring as an aid to dosage adjustment in antiepileptic drug monotherapy for newly-diagnosed epilepsy. Future studies should be appropriately powered, ideally analysing individual antiepileptic drugs, and could consider not using strict adherence to poorly defined target ranges of drug concentrations as part of the intervention. Although the practical and ethical difficulties would be considerable, the extension of follow up beyond two years would be of interest. </P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (4 September 2006). This register contains reports of trials identified from regular searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and of MEDLINE. Relevant reports are also identified by handsearching selected journals and conference proceedings.</P>
<P>In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2005). Details of the search strategy used are given below. No language restrictions were imposed. We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional reports of relevant studies.</P>
<P>The following search strategy was used for MEDLINE and was modified for other databases.</P>
