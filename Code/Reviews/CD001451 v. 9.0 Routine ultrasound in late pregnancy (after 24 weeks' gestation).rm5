<TITLE MODIFIED="2015-06-18 14:37:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">Routine ultrasound in late pregnancy (after 24 weeks' gestation) to assess the effects on the infant and maternal outcomes</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Ultrasound can be used as a clinical diagnostic tool in late pregnancy to assess the baby's condition when there are complications, or to detect problems which may not otherwise be apparent. If such problems are identified this may lead to changes in care and an improved outcome for babies. Carrying out scans on all women is however controversial. Screening all women may mean that the number of interventions is increased without benefit to mothers or babies. Although popular, women may not fully understand the purpose of their scan and may be either falsely reassured, or unprepared for adverse findings. Existing evidence shows that routine ultrasound, after 24 weeks' gestation, in low-risk or unselected women does not provide any benefit for the mother or her baby. Thirteen studies involving 34,980 women who were randomly selected to screening or a control group (no or selective ultrasound, or ultrasound with concealed results) contributed to the review. The quality of trials was satisfactory. There were no differences between groups in the rates of women having additional scans, antenatal admissions, preterm delivery less than 37 weeks, induction of labour, instrumental deliveries or caesarean section. Babies&#8217; birthweight, condition at birth, interventions such as resuscitation, and admission to special care were similar between groups. Infant survival, with or without congenital abnormalities, was no different with and without routine ultrasound screening in late pregnancy. None of the trials reported on the effect of routine ultrasound in late pregnancy on preterm birth less than 34 weeks, maternal psychology or mental development of babies when two years old.</P>
<P>The ultrasound scan protocols in each trial varied, as did the reasons for ultrasound scans after 24 weeks' gestation. The influence of first and second trimester ultrasounds is difficult to disentangle, and assessment of most measures at late pregnancy is based on gestational reference data, which rely on accurate gestational dating in early pregnancy. Trials were undertaken over a period of time covering early introduction into clinical practice to widespread use, during which time how to assess fetal size and well being ultrasonographically were still being debated. As ultrasound technology continues to advance and become more accessible, it is important to maintain a clear idea of its relevance. Ultrasound, being a clinical investigation, may be used to detect abnormality without the impact of such detection on clinical outcomes being full assessed. Exposure of the expectant mother to uncertainty and possible anxiety about the health of her baby has implications that may be far reaching. In addition, little is known about how the baby that was compromised in the uterus develops after birth and in the first years of life.</P>

<P>Diagnostic ultrasound is used selectively in late pregnancy where there are specific clinical indications. However, the value of routine late pregnancy ultrasound screening in unselected populations is controversial.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:51:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Thirteen trials recruiting 34,980 women were included in the systematic review. Risk of bias was low for allocation concealment and selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data and high for blinding of both outcome assessment and participants and personnel. There was no difference in antenatal, obstetric and neonatal outcome or morbidity in screened versus control groups. Routine late pregnancy ultrasound was not associated with improvements in overall perinatal mortality. There is little information on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment. There is a lack of data on maternal psychological effects.</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence for the primary outcomes of perinatal mortality, preterm birth less than 37 weeks, induction of labour and caesarean section were assessed to be of moderate or high quality with GRADE software. There was no association between ultrasound in late pregnancy and perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.54; participants = 30,675; studies = eight; I = 29%), preterm birth less than 37 weeks (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08; participants = 17,151; studies = two; I = 0%), induction of labour (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; participants = 22,663; studies = six; I = 78%), or caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; participants = 27,461; studies = six; I = 54%). Three additional primary outcomes chosen for the 'Summary of findings' table were preterm birth less than 34 weeks, maternal psychological effects and neurodevelopment at age two. Because none of the included studies reported these outcomes, they were not assessed for quality with GRADE software.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:51:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Based on existing evidence, routine late pregnancy ultrasound in low-risk or unselected populations does not confer benefit on mother or baby. There was no difference in the primary outcomes of perinatal mortality, preterm birth less than 37 weeks, caesarean section rates, and induction of labour rates if ultrasound in late pregnancy was performed routinely versus not performed routinely. Meanwhile, data were lacking for the other primary outcomes: preterm birth less than 34 weeks, maternal psychological effects, and neurodevelopment at age two, reflecting a paucity of research covering these outcomes. These outcomes may warrant future research.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fetal growth/size</HEADING>
<P>Small-for-gestational age (SGA) fetuses are at greater risk of stillbirth, birth hypoxia, neonatal complications in the perinatal period, impaired neurodevelopment and cerebral palsy in childhood, and non-insulin dependent diabetes and hypertension in adult life (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1993</LINK>). The majority of these small infants are not diagnosed until delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Leeson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeson 1997</LINK>), and detecting these fetuses prenatally remains a priority of antenatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Lindqvist-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindqvist 2005</LINK>). Methods of detecting SGA fetuses include antenatal clinical examination, measurement of symphysis-fundal height, fetal anthropometry and ultrasound estimated fetal weight. <LINK REF="REF-Harding-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1995</LINK> demonstrated that symphysis-fundal height measurements perform relatively poorly compared with ultrasound abdominal circumference measurements, while <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2000</LINK> suggested that, for term pregnancies, clinical examinations provide more accurate estimates of birthweight than ultrasound. A combined approach of screening with symphysis-fundal height measurement, complemented with ultrasound-derived fetal abdominal circumference if failing growth is suspected, has been advocated. <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1996</LINK> cautions that small size should be viewed as a clinical sign, and not a diagnosis, as a number of small fetuses are not at risk of an adverse outcome. Furthermore, the use of ultrasound to detect the SGA fetus is dogged by a number of complicating factors, including the lack of defined thresholds for normality versus abnormality, its dependence on accurate gestational dating, the fact that the assessment of growth velocity (serial measurements) may be more valuable clinically than a single estimate of size, and differences due to other factors, namely, maternal ethnicity and parity, fetal gender and environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1989</LINK>). A more recent study has found that maternal ethnicity may not be as important as previously thought as fetal growth and newborn length are similar across diverse geographical settings when mothers' nutritional and health needs are met, and environmental constraints on growth are low (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2014</LINK>). A previous systematic review of routine late pregnancy anthropometry concluded that despite increased intervention (admission to hospital and induction of labour), there was no identifiable benefit in fetal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another clinical concern is with the large-for-gestational-age (LGA) fetus. These babies are at increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality, which arises mainly from birth injury and asphyxia; their mothers are at increased risk of cephalo-pelvic disproportion and its sequelae, and operative delivery and the associated morbidity. Our ability to detect fetal macrosomia (large baby) antenatally by clinical examination remains limited (<LINK REF="REF-Lurie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lurie 1995</LINK>), and the antenatal prediction of fetal macrosomia is associated with a marked increase in caesarean births, without a significant reduction in the incidence of shoulder dystocia or fetal injury (<LINK REF="REF-Weeks-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeks 1995</LINK>). This is because most cases of shoulder dystocia and birth trauma occur in non-macrosomic infants (<LINK REF="REF-Gonen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonen 1996</LINK>). Hence, the value of detecting LGA fetuses by routine ultrasound in late pregnancy is questionable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Amniotic fluid</HEADING>
<P>Fetal urine is the major source of amniotic fluid in the latter half of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Brace-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brace 1989</LINK>). Decreased amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios) in the absence of ruptured membranes or fetal anomalies is thought to be associated with chronic fetal compromise and redistribution of regional blood flow leading to a reduction in fetal renal blood flow, fetal oliguria (low output of urine) and thus less amniotic fluid. Increased amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios) occurs as a result of overproduction (polyuria in fetuses of diabetic mothers, rare placental tumours), decreased turnover (congenital anomalies affecting fetal swallowing), or unknown aetiology. Both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios can be diagnosed by ultrasound measurement of maximum pool depth, two-diameter amniotic fluid pocket or amniotic fluid index (the sum of the vertical maximum pool depths in four quadrants), and applying the result to normal reference ranges. While in high-risk pregnancies, such as postdate pregnancy, the measurement of amniotic fluid volume may have bearing on management decisions, there is some debate about the best measurement method, and the clinical significance of the available reference ranges, which compounds the uncertainty about the effect on perinatal outcome of detecting amniotic fluid abnormalities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The placenta</HEADING>
<P>Placenta praevia occurs in 0.5% of pregnancies and is associated with considerable risk to both mother and fetus. Ultrasound is the best available method for locating the placental position (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1989</LINK>). Only 10% of low placentas at second trimester scan remain low at term (<LINK REF="REF-Rizos-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizos 1979</LINK>). However, in most pregnancies with placenta praevia, a clinical indication for diagnostic ultrasound will arise such as antepartum haemorrhage and fetal malpresentation, and therefore the role of screening for placenta praevia is debatable.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Grannum-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grannum 1979</LINK> described a classification system to grade the placental texture appearances on ultrasound imaging, and suggested a correlation between maturational changes of the placenta as seen on ultrasound and fetal pulmonic maturity. This was not confirmed in further study, but an association between 'mature' appearances at earlier gestations with maternal smoking and placental dysfunction was postulated. Therefore, the knowledge of placental appearances in late pregnancy could, in theory, result in care leading to improved perinatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Abramowicz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramowicz 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Structural fetal abnormalities</HEADING>
<P>A number of structural fetal abnormalities may manifest later in pregnancy. These include craniospinal abnormalities (microcephaly and hydrocephaly), gastrointestinal abnormalities (intestinal obstruction and atresia), urinary tract abnormalities, and some skeletal abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Chitty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitty 1995</LINK>). It has been suggested that the value of detecting fetal structural abnormalities before birth allows for the optimal timing and mode of delivery leading to improved management and outcome. However, a report of a Working Party of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Ultrasound Screening for Fetal Abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1997</LINK>), stated that further research is required to evaluate whether prior identification of an abnormality before birth, particularly those amenable to intrauterine procedures and neonatal surgery, is advantageous in both the short and long term.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fetal presentation</HEADING>
<P>Some fetal malpresentations (e.g. breech) go undetected during routine antenatal care but would be identified by routine ultrasound in late pregnancy. In a retrospective case review, <LINK REF="REF-Nwosu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nwosu 1993</LINK> showed that babies undiagnosed as a breech were not subject to increased morbidity and mortality compared with a breech diagnosed prior to labour. This highlights the uncertainty about the clinical value of routine ultrasound screening for fetal malpresentation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-15 10:17:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Diagnostic ultrasound is a sophisticated electronic technology, which utilises pulses of high frequency sound. The transducer, which is moved across the area to be examined, emits the pulses of ultrasound which propagate through the tissues, and some are reflected back to the transducer which converts these returning echoes into electronic signals. Tissue interface characteristics determine the strength of the returning echo. Signals are processed by a computer which displays each echo in both strength and position as an image on a screen.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Safety</HEADING>
<P>The use of routine pregnancy ultrasound needs to be considered in the context of potential hazards. Theoretically, some ultrasonic energy propagated through tissue is converted to heat, and biological effects of ultrasound have been observed in laboratory experiments. However, these effects have been produced using continuous wave ultrasound with long 'dwell' time (time insonating one area) and high power output. Diagnostic ultrasound is pulsed wave (short pulses of sound propagation), and most modern machines have inbuilt safety features, so that safe power output limits cannot be exceeded. Operators are advised to apply the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably attainable) to the ultrasound power output used (<LINK REF="REF-EFSUMB-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFSUMB 1995</LINK>), and to ensure time taken for an examination, including the 'dwell' time over a specific target, is kept to a minimum. However, there is some evidence that operators' knowledge about safety may not be accurate (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiner 2007</LINK>). At present, there is no clear epidemiological evidence that ultrasound examination during pregnancy is harmful, but no firm conclusion has been reached from available data (<I>see</I> Cochrane review: <I>Ultrasound for fetal assessment in early pregnancy</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Whitworth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitworth 2010</LINK>)), and therefore, continual vigilance is necessary. This is particularly important in a context where scans are increasingly being carried out for non-medical reasons, and where there is a paucity of information on the number of scans women actually receive as a part of their antenatal care (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2004</LINK>). Apart from the physics of ultrasound, the potential harm of misdiagnosis and unnecessary intervention, such as unnecessary late preterm birth should also be considered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cost and maternal psychological effects</HEADING>
<P>There have been few studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of ultrasound scans (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2002</LINK>). While there is some information on the direct costs of ultrasound examinations, there is much less on indirect cost (e.g. the costs of associated counselling, follow-up tests and related interventions, and indirect costs to women). Further, there is relatively little information on the psychological impact of ultrasound on women and their families (partners are frequently present for scans). Scans are popular with women, but women may not fully understand the purpose of their scan, and may be either falsely reassured or unprepared for adverse findings (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>This is an ongoing issue that must be addressed. Furthermore, as ultrasound technology continues to advance and become more accessible it is important to maintain a clear idea of its relevance. In particular, classically fetal size or amniotic fluid volume are known to be clinical signs which can be readily detected by ultrasound, however, how much this information improves outcomes is not well established. By contrast, placental location is known to pose considerable risk to both mother and fetus and ultrasound remains the best available method of early determination of placental location (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1989</LINK>). There remain inconsistencies in the available evidence regarding ultrasound in late pregnancy. Ultrasound, being a clinical investigation, may be used to detect abnormality without the impact of such detection on clinical outcomes being fully assessed. Furthermore, there are issues with the use of ultrasound including cost, access, maternal psychological effects and the need for continuous reassessment of its safety. Hence, it is important that this review evaluates the impact the use of ultrasound in late pregnancy on clinical outcomes.</P>

<P>All acceptably controlled trials of routine ultrasound in late pregnancy (after 24 weeks).

<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence </HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>).

<P>GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>For this update there were no cluster-randomised trials of relevance found. If in future updates we find relevant cluster-randomised trials, we will include these in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We have not included cross-over trials in this review because we do not consider this trial design appropriate to answer the review question.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>We have included three trials with multiple pregnancies in the cohort in this review. One outcome in the first comparison, routine ultrasound &gt; 24 weeks versus no/concealed/selective ultrasound included the outcome of perinatal mortality (twins). Ideally when including multiple pregnancies analyses should be adjusted for clustering to take into account the non-independence of babies from the same pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2004</LINK>), as when considering babies from a multiple pregnancy it is important to note they are more likely to have similar outcomes than babies from different pregnancies. If this adjustment is made confidence intervals are likely to be wider. We did not adjust for clustering in this review because the number of multiple pregnancies included is small and adjusting would make little difference to the findings and conclusion.</P>

</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:56:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:56:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either the Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. Had we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).

<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:56:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not considered clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>We did not conduct subgroup analysis for this update of the review.

Possible subgroups include those with comparable first and/or second trimester ultrasonography, or studies conducted within a certain timeframe to account for changes in technology, or studies which include a management algorithm based on ultrasound findings. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, we will use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>Only the seven primary outcome measures will be used for subgroup analysis. We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2015-06-29 10:07:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nancy  Medley">
<P>Ultrasound examination options differed between trials, with some offering no routine scans at any time in pregnancy to the control group, some offering routine scans to all participants earlier in pregnancy (before 24 weeks' gestation), and some offering routine scan at all stages of the trial, but only revealing results of late pregnancy ultrasound (after 24 weeks' gestation) for the study groups.</P>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alesund-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alesund 1999</LINK> (Norway); <LINK REF="STD-Belanger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belanger 1996</LINK> (USA); <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK> (USA); <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 1984</LINK> (Norway)), offered routine ultrasound in the second and third trimesters versus selective ultrasound. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-New-Zealand-1993" TYPE="STUDY">New Zealand 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skrastad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Skrastad 2013</LINK> (Norway)), all women had second trimester ultrasound scans, and only the study group underwent a further third trimester ultrasound. In the <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2003</LINK> (UK) trial, all women had a first trimester scan while the study group had additional scans at 30 to 32 weeks and 36 to 37 weeks. In the <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1984</LINK> (UK) trial, all women were offered second and third trimester ultrasound scans, but the results of the third trimester ultrasound were revealed only for the study group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Peterborough-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peterborough 1987</LINK> (UK) trial, all women had routine second and third trimester ultrasound scans, but placental grading at the third trimester ultrasound was revealed only for the study group. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ellwood-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ellwood 1997</LINK> (Australia); <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1993</LINK> (Australia)), all women had routine second trimester ultrasound scans, and only the study group was offered serial ultrasound screening thereafter. In the <LINK REF="STD-Wladimiroff-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wladimiroff 1980</LINK> trial, all women underwent routine antenatal care, then only the study group was offered a single ultrasound to assess fetal chest area at 32 to 36 weeks.</P>
<P>The trials evaluated different aspects of third trimester ultrasound. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1984</LINK> (UK); <LINK REF="STD-New-Zealand-1993" TYPE="STUDY">New Zealand 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wladimiroff-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wladimiroff 1980</LINK>), addressed ultrasound screening for 'small for dates'. The <LINK REF="STD-Peterborough-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peterborough 1987</LINK> (UK) trial addressed the value of placental grading as an adjunct to routine third trimester ultrasound scan. The <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2003</LINK> trial examined the impact of two third trimester scans which assessed liquor volume, fetal weight and placental maturity. The <LINK REF="STD-Skrastad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Skrastad 2013</LINK> trial assessed the impact of one third trimester scan which assessed fetal anatomy. The <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK> (USA) trial was the only study that reported in detail, detection of fetal abnormalities at routine third trimester ultrasound scan. The <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1993</LINK> (Australia) trial combined repeated ultrasound scan for fetal biometry and amniotic fluid assessment with Doppler ultrasound, and the data were therefore analysed in a separate comparison (serial ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound versus selective ultrasound), and were also included in another Cochrane review entitled '<I>Fetal and umbilical Doppler ultrasound in normal pregnancy</I>' (Alfirevic 2010). The <LINK REF="STD-Ellwood-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ellwood 1997</LINK> trial also compared repeated ultrasound scans with routine second trimester ultrasound only.</P>
<P>The results of the review should be considered in the light of these different factors, as the specific nature of the ultrasound regimens may have had some effect on the outcome measures.</P>
<P>Childhood developmental outcomes were measured in the <LINK REF="STD-Belanger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belanger 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1993</LINK> studies as well as in the Alesund and Trondheim trials (the longer-term outcomes from the latter two trials have been combined (<LINK REF="STD-Norway-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Norway 1992</LINK>)).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant effect of ultrasound after 24 weeks on the outcomes of induction of labour (average risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.07, six studies; 22,663 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.02; Chi = 23.07, (P = 0.0003); I = 78%, evidence graded as moderate quality) or caesarean section (average RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; six studies; 27,461 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Chi = 10.79, (P = 0.06); I = 54%, evidence graded as high quality). There was substantial heterogeneity for both of these outcomes. For the outcome of induction of labour, removing <LINK REF="STD-Alesund-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alesund 1999</LINK> reduced the heterogeneity to 10%; the effect size changed minimally and remained statistically insignificant. For the outcome of caesarean section, removal of <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 1984</LINK> had little effect on heterogeneity or on the overall effect estimate. Both <LINK REF="STD-Alesund-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alesund 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 1984</LINK> collected data between 1979 and 1981, when ultrasound practices may have differed substantially and ultrasound technology was less advanced compared with later trials in this review. No group differences were detected for the remaining primary outcomes: preterm delivery before 37 weeks (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08; two studies, 17,151 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, evidence graded as high quality) and perinatal mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.54; eight studies; 30,675 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, evidence graded as moderate quality).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were a number of secondary outcomes captured. Specifically, ultrasound after 24 weeks had no effect on antenatal admission (average RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; four studies; 5396 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.07; Chi = 19.63, (P = 0.0002); I = 85%). There was considerable heterogeneity for this outcome. Two studies reported on whether routine ultrasound increased or reduced the need for further ultrasound scans. The findings from the two studies were not consistent, therefore we have not pooled results; in the <LINK REF="STD-New-Zealand-1993" TYPE="STUDY">New Zealand 1993</LINK> trial, women who had routine scans were less likely to need further scans (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.76, 1527 women), conversely, in the <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 1984</LINK> study, women in the routine scan group had an increased risk of undergoing further scans although the difference between groups was not statistically significant (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.89, 1009 women). (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no group differences found for the following labour and delivery outcomes: number of days in hospital (mean difference (MD) 0.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.13; one study; 877 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>); cardiotocograph (CTG) (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.06; one study; 2000 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>); instrumental delivery (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.16; five studies; 12,310 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>); elective caesarean section (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34; four studies; 5884 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>); or emergency caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.20; five studies; 12,310 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>Significantly less women who had ultrasound after 24 weeks gave birth to post-term infants, with delivery after 42 weeks' gestation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; two studies; 17,151 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no treatment group differences in the gestational age of infants at delivery (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.02; three studies; 9303 infants; fixed-effect analysis, Heterogeneity: Chi = 5.36, (P = 0.07); I = 63%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). Random-effects analysis had no impact on the high heterogeneity for this outcome. Neither did ultrasound have an effect on birthweight outcomes: birthweight (MD 4.40, 95% CI -8.89 to 17.69; five studies; 26,136 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>); birthweight less than the 10th centile (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28; four studies; 20,293 infants; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.05; Chi = 10.15, (P = 0.02); I = 70%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>); birthweight less than the 5th centile (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.74; two studies; 2404 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>); and low birthweight less than 2.5 kg (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.18; three studies; 4510 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).</P>
<P>Routine ultrasound after 24 weeks also had no significant effect on the following neonatal outcomes: neonatal resuscitation (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08; five studies; 12,909 infants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>); neonatal ventilation (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.77; two studies; 3004 infants; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.42; Chi = 3.92, (P = 0.05); I = 74%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>); Apgar score of less than seven at five minutes (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.93; four studies; 5889 infants; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.35; Chi = 7.39, (P = 0.06); I = 59%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>); admission to special care baby unit (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; five studies; 12,915 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>); or stillbirths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.70; six studies; 28,107 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>).</P>
<P>Composite neonatal outcomes and neonatal outcomes omitting congenital abnormalities also detected no group differences: moderate neonatal morbidity (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; one study; 15,281 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>); severe neonatal morbidity (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.36; one study; 15,281 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>); perinatal mortality excluding congenital abnormalities (average RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.19; six studies; 28,133 infants; random-effects analysis, Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.27; Chi = 8.26, (P = 0.08); I = 52%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>); stillbirths excluding congenital abnormalities (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.90; two studies; 2902 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>); neonatal deaths excluding congenital abnormalities (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.96; two studies; 2901 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, three studies with 314 women reported no group differences for perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.66; <LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were not performed due to the small number of included studies and limited data. For a number of the comparisons there was considerable heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity was substantial (over 50%), we have used a random-effects model. In view of high levels of heterogeneity these results should be interpreted with caution. Possible causes of heterogeneity include the wide variation in ultrasound practice during the dates of the included trials (1979 to 2013). Protocol surrounding ultrasound practice will have changed; also, ultrasound technology has advanced rapidly over this time period. There may also be important differences in women receiving ultrasound across this time period. Finally, baseline rates of important birth outcomes like caesarean section will also have changed markedly since 1979.</P>

<P>One of the trials examining ultrasound after 24 weeks' gestation used a quasi-randomised design with poor allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1984</LINK>). We conducted a sensitivity analysis, removing this trial from each primary outcome where it contributed data, to see if this would make any difference to the direction of findings or to the size of the treatment effect. Removing this study made little difference to the results; it did not change the direction of findings and, as it was a relatively small study, made little difference to the size of the treatment effect even for those outcomes where only a small number of trials contributed data.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:58:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Meta-analysis of the data shows very little difference between groups in antenatal, obstetric and neonatal outcomes, apart from less women giving birth post-term if they had ultrasound after 24 weeks. Data from two trials were available for the outcome post-term birth (<LINK REF="STD-Peterborough-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peterborough 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK>), with the latter contributing 98.9% of the data. In the RADIUS trial, women in the control group did not have routine early pregnancy ultrasound but women in the intervention group did, and therefore gestational dating was not accurate for the control group, hence it is difficult to know if the pregnancies in the control group were indeed post-term or not, or if there may have been more or less post-term pregnancies. Given this, we are not able to conclude anything about the finding of less post-term births in the intervention group. As current clinical practice is to offer induction of labour before 42 completed weeks' gestation in pregnancy, it is unlikely that this issue will ever be resolved.</P>
<P>Overall, perinatal mortality was no different for all fetuses or neonates, and twin pregnancies. Although there was some heterogeneity in perinatal mortality overall (I = 29%), there was increased heterogeneity in perinatal mortality corrected for abnormality (I = 52%). This was due to the <LINK REF="STD-Peterborough-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peterborough 1987</LINK> (UK) trial data that suggested a significant reduction in the number of congenitally normal stillbirths. This trial was unique in that it was an evaluation of placental grading as an adjunct to routine late pregnancy ultrasound. The authors state that this observation was not a formal prior hypothesis and may be an overestimate of the true effect of the test. In view of the nature of the trial, i.e. single centre and limited power to assess perinatal outcome (2000 participants), and the fact that it was performed over two decades ago (1987), this finding needs to be revisited in future research.</P>
<P>There was no overall difference in the incidence of babies being small-for-gestational age (SGA) at birth (less than 10th percentile) comparing experimental and control groups (average risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.28), but there was high heterogeneity (I = 70%), mainly due to the findings of the <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2003</LINK> study which found fewer babies less than 10th birthweight centile in the intervention group. It is difficult to interpret this finding as it cannot be attributable to late ultrasound scan because ultrasound itself cannot promote fetal growth. Whilst, theoretically, there is some potential scope to decrease the impact of low birthweight by recognition of fetal growth restriction through ultrasound screening, and early planned delivery, there is no evidence to suggest that ultrasound late in pregnancy has any specific beneficial effect.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:59:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The ultrasound scan protocols in each trial varied. It is difficult to assess the effect of scans before 24 weeks' gestation on the outcome measures. For example, the finding of a reduction in post-term delivery in the screened group of the <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK> (USA) study is probably due to better gestational age assessment at the 18 to 20 week scan. In addition, the reason for routine ultrasound scan after 24 weeks' gestation differed amongst trials. Ideally, subgroup analyses according to the reason for the scan would resolve the possible difference in outcomes according to the diagnostic approach, but there are not enough studies to perform meaningful subgroup analyses. This may explain some of the heterogeneity and the results of the meta-analysis should be viewed in this light.</P>
<P>Furthermore, ultrasound is a diagnostic tool, and on its own would not be expected to improve outcomes unless if it is abnormal it leads to a change in management. While the presumption is that the ultrasound findings were evaluated by clinicians and action taken accordingly, none of the trials had management algorithms that should have been followed on the basis of the ultrasound findings and therefore management was not standardised. The finding of no effect on outcomes needs to be considered in this context.</P>
<P>To target the effect of late pregnancy, ultrasound trials should ideally compare ultrasound in late pregnancy alone versus no ultrasound or similar control, however this is generally not how these studies have been designed. Commonly, the influence of first and second trimester ultrasounds is difficult to disentangle. Also, the fact that assessment of most parameters at late pregnancy ultrasound are based on gestational reference data, which in turn rely on accurate gestational dating in early pregnancy, further compounds this issue. Therefore, it is neither realistic, nor pragmatic, to consider ultrasound in late pregnancy in isolation.</P>
<P>Only one of the trials was powered to address perinatal mortality, <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK>, which randomised over 15,000 women. It was also the only trial with extractable data whereby women in the control group did not have at least one routine scan as it was mainly designed to evaluate detection of fetal abnormalities with routine ultrasound. This trial was undertaken between 1987 and 1991 and its findings may not be relevant in today&#8217;s developed-world maternity setting given the relatively rapid advances in ultrasound technology and the fact that almost all women have routine ultrasound at earlier gestations, that is, the first and second trimesters.</P>
<P>Apart from the <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2003</LINK> trial, trials were undertaken over a period of time from early introduction into clinical practice to widespread use and assimilation during which biometric formulae, technology and techniques, parameters of normality and deviation from normal and consensus about how to assess fetal size and well being ultrasonographically were still being debated. Some of the findings inevitably therefore have a shelf life. The <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2003</LINK> trial more reflects the ultrasonographic approach to assessing fetal growth and well being by today&#8217;s standards even though it was published 11 years ago, but it showed no benefit in terms of perinatal outcome apart from fewer babies less than 10<SUP>th</SUP> birthweight centile in the ultrasound group but as previously mentioned this cannot be attributable to scan as ultrasound cannot promote better growth.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1993</LINK> (Australia) trial there was an unexpected finding of significantly higher intrauterine growth restriction in the serial ultrasound and Doppler examination group (i.e. the intensive group). The authors state that while this may have been a chance finding, it is possible that frequent exposure to ultrasound may have influenced fetal growth. This finding was not associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality, and follow-up of these children at one year of age found that the difference was no longer discernible (<LINK REF="REF-Newnham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newnham 1996</LINK>). The authors stress the need for further investigation of the effects of frequent ultrasound exposure on fetal growth. Furthermore, if this were a true effect, the modality responsible (Doppler ultrasound versus real-time ultrasound) would need to be elucidated. More recent data from this trial reporting findings for children at eight years of age found no negative effect associated with serial ultrasound in terms of physical size or speech, language and neurological development (<LINK REF="REF-Newnham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newnham 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Long-term follow-up of children from the Norwegian studies revealed no positive or negative effects of exposure to ultrasound in children aged eight to nine years although there was an association between exposure to ultrasound in utero and non-right handedness. This finding may be a chance one, but merits further investigation (<LINK REF="STD-Alesund-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alesund 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norway-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Norway 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 1984</LINK>). A recent follow-up study of young adults born to women recruited for <LINK REF="STD-Perth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Perth 1993</LINK> shows no links between the timing and frequency of ultrasound with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder or the presence of autistic-like traits (<LINK REF="REF-Stoch-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoch 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK> (USA) trial and <LINK REF="STD-Skrastad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Skrastad 2013</LINK> trial were the only studies that addressed detection of fetal anomalies in the third trimester. The overall fetal anomaly detection rate in the <LINK REF="STD-RADIUS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">RADIUS 1993</LINK> trial was poor, at 35%. After 24 weeks' gestation, 34/156 (22%) anomalous fetuses were detected in the screened group, and 10/155 (6.5%) anomalies were detected in the control group. The overall fetal anomaly detection rate in the <LINK REF="STD-Skrastad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Skrastad 2013</LINK> trial was 56%. After 23 weeks' gestation, 25/70 (36%) anomalies were detected in the screened group, and 17/83 (20%) anomalies were detected in the control group. However, the better detection rate in the screened groups in both trials did not translate into an improvement in infant survival.</P>
<P>Few of the trials addressed long-term neurodevelopmental outcome and none examined maternal psychological outcome, and it is arguable that these are the most important outcomes. The <LINK REF="STD-Belanger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belanger 1996</LINK> trial reported results of Bayley evaluations at six and 18 months on a subset of 286 infants in the study and found no difference in the Mental Development Index and Psychomotor Development Index in those in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. Exposure of the expectant mother to uncertainty and possible anxiety about the health of her baby has implications which may be far reaching. In addition, perinatal survival does not automatically translate into long-term success, as little is known about the long-term prognosis of the in utero compromised fetus.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Overall, risk of bias in these studies was mixed. Broadly, for most of the included studies risk of bias was assessed as low for allocation concealment and selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data and high for blinding of both outcome assessment and participants and personnel. For the primary outcomes, GRADE assessments are shown in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Perinatal mortality was considered to be of moderate quality; the evidence for this outcome was downgraded for a wide confidence interval crossing the line of no effect. Preterm birth less than 37 weeks was graded as of high quality, as was the outcome of caesarean section. The outcome of induction of labour was graded as of moderate quality due to the high heterogeneity for this outcome (78%). Three outcomes considered important to this review were not measured in any of the included trials and therefore have no quality rating from GRADE: preterm birth less than 34 weeks, maternal psychological effects and neurological development at age two.</P>

<P>There is no evidence that routine ultrasound in late pregnancy improves perinatal outcome. As a result of this review, it is not clear what aspects of late pregnancy ultrasound may be valuable in centres where it is undertaken. However, placental grading may be useful, and perhaps should be considered in late pregnancy ultrasound, whether routine or selective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-15 17:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a lack of data about the potential psychological effects of routine ultrasound in late pregnancy, and the effects on both short- and long-term neonatal and childhood outcomes. Future studies should address these issues.</P>
<P>Based on the available data about the value of placental grading, future research of late pregnancy ultrasound should include assessment of placental texture.</P>
<P>Future trials should include management algorithms in order to assess the impact of acting upon abnormal ultrasound findings.</P>

<P>In this study, third trimester ultrasound was used to identify a group of uncomplicated pregnancies where there was ultrasound suspicion of poor intrauterine growth, but no clinical suspicion of poor growth. Only these pregnancies were randomised. The revealed group underwent serial tests of fetal well being (non-stress CTG and serum oestriol and placental lactogen) and fetal growth and management was planned depending on the results of the tests. Therefore, the study assessed the value of various tests of fetal well being if fetal growth retardation was suspected, rather than the value of routine third trimester ultrasound alone.</P>
