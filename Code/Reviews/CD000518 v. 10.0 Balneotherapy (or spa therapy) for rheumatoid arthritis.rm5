<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-06-22 14:01:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jordi Pardo Pardo">
<P>We reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of balneotherapy (natural mineral waters, gases and mudpacks or spa therapy) in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Balneotherapy is defined as bathing in natural mineral or thermal waters (e.g. mineral baths, sulphur baths, Dead Sea baths), using mudpacks or doing both. Upon searching for all relevant studies up to December 2014, we found nine studies with 579 people. The quality of the evidence is very low mainly because of the low number of participants in the studies and concerns about study designs.</P>
<P>
<B>This review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8226; we are uncertain whether mudpacks (balneotherapy) improve pain, overall wellness and swollen joints compared with placebo (fake treatment) in patients with hand RA. Mudpacks may improve tender joints slightly compared with placebo, but information about physical ability and adverse events was not reported in the study.</P>
<P>&#8226; adding radon to carbon dioxide baths did not improve pain intensity at three months but may improve overall well-being and pain at six months compared with carbon dioxide baths without radon, but this may have happened by chance. Information about physical disability, tender and swollen joints and adverse events was not reported in the studies.</P>
<P>&#8226; we are uncertain whether balneotherapy (seated immersion) improves pain and physical function compared with hydrotherapy, exercise or relaxation. Improvement, tender joints, swollen joints and adverse events were not reported in the study.</P>
<P>&#8226; we are uncertain whether bathing in mineral baths (balneotherapy) improves pain and swollen joints compared with using a drug (Cyclosporin A). Mineral baths may improve overall wellness compared with Cyclosporin A, and Cyclosporin A may improve the number of tender joints compared with mineral baths. Physical disability and adverse events were not reported.</P>
<P>&#8226; we do not have precise information about side effects and complications of balneotherapy. This is particularly true for rare side effects. Side effects may include skin rash, infection and accidents, for example, slipping on wet surfaces near the bath area. The only study that reported side effects stated that they did not find any. </P>
<P>
<B>What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is balneotherapy?</B>
</P>
<P>When you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA), your immune system, which normally fights infection, inflames the lining of your joints, making them painful, stiff and swollen. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. No cure for RA is known at present, so treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness while improving your ability to move.</P>
<P>Balneotherapy (bathing in water) is a type of therapy that aims to reduce pain and improve daily functioning. Balneotherapy often takes place at centres with thermal baths or seawater baths.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-01 09:40:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No cure for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known at present, so treatment often focuses on management of symptoms such as pain, stiffness and mobility. Treatment options include pharmacological interventions, physical therapy treatments and balneotherapy. Balneotherapy is defined as bathing in natural mineral or thermal waters (e.g. mineral baths, sulphur baths, Dead Sea baths), using mudpacks or doing both. Despite its popularity, reported scientific evidence for the effectiveness or efficacy of balneotherapy is sparse. This review, which evaluates the effects of balneotherapy in patients with RA, is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and updated in 2008.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:21:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane 'Rehabilitation and Related Therapies' Field Register (to December 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 1), MEDLIINE (1950 to December 2014), EMBASE (1988 to December 2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to December 2014), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1985 to December 2014), PsycINFO (1806 to December 2014) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We applied no language restrictions; however, studies not reported in English, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, German or French are awaiting assessment. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing and recently completed trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-04-02 06:03:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) consisting of participants with definitive or classical RA as defined by the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria of 1958, the ARA/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria of 1988 or the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria of 2010, or by studies using the criteria of Steinbrocker.</P>
<P>Balneotherapy had to be the intervention under study, and had to be compared with another intervention or with no intervention. </P>
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) determined in 1992 a core set of eight endpoints in clinical trials concerning patients with RA. We considered pain, improvement, disability, tender joints, swollen joints and adverse events among the main outcome measures.

<P>This review includes two new studies and a total of nine studies involving 579 participants. Unfortunately, most studies showed an unclear risk of bias in most domains. Four out of nine studies did not contribute to the analysis, as they presented no data.</P>
<P>One study involving 45 participants with hand RA compared mudpacks versus placebo. We found no statistically significant differences in terms of pain on a 0 to 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (mean difference (MD) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 1.84), improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.70) or number of swollen joints on a scale from 0 to 28 (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.90 to 2.10) (very low level of evidence). We found a very low level of evidence of reduction in the number of tender joints on a scale from 0 to 28 (MD -4.60, 95% CI -8.72 to -0.48; 16% absolute difference). We reported no physical disability and presented no data on withdrawals due to adverse events or on serious adverse events.</P>
<P>Two studies involving 194 participants with RA evaluated the effectiveness of additional radon in carbon dioxide baths. We found no statistically significant differences between groups for all outcomes at three-month follow-up (low to moderate level of evidence). We noted some benefit of additional radon at six months in terms of pain frequency (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; 31% reduction; improvement in one or more points (categories) on a 4-point scale; moderate level of evidence) and 9.6% reduction in pain intensity on a 0 to 100-mm VAS (MD 9.6 mm, 95% CI 1.6 to 17.6; moderate level of evidence). We also observed some benefit in one study including 60 participants in terms of improvement in one or more categories based on a 4-point scale (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.7; 30% absolute difference; low level of evidence). Study authors did not report physical disability, tender joints, swollen joints, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events.</P>
<P>One study involving 148 participants with RA compared balneotherapy (seated immersion) versus hydrotherapy (exercises in water), land exercises or relaxation therapy. We found no statistically significant differences in pain on the McGill Questionnaire or in physical disability (very low level of evidence) between balneotherapy and the other interventions. No data on improvement, tender joints, swollen joints, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events were presented.</P>
<P>One study involving 57 participants with RA evaluated the effectiveness of mineral baths (balneotherapy) versus Cyclosporin A. We found no statistically significant differences in pain intensity on a 0 to 100-mm VAS (MD 9.64, 95% CI -1.66 to 20.94; low level of evidence) at 8 weeks (absolute difference 10%). We found some benefit of balneotherapy in overall improvement on a 5-point scale at eight weeks of 54% (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.83). We found no statistically significant differences (low level of evidence) in the number of swollen joints, but some benefit of Cyclosporin A in the number of tender joints (MD 8.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 14; very low level of evidence). Physical disability, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events were not reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral joints. In adults, the incidence of new cases is 50/100 000/y and one-year prevalence is between 500 and 600/100 000 (0.5% to 1.0%) (<LINK REF="REF-Symmons-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symmons 1994</LINK>). Common symptoms of RA consist of a combination of pain, fatigue, stiffness, reduced range of motion in the joints and muscle weakness. Inflammation can cause progressive destruction of articular and periarticular structures (<LINK REF="REF-McInnes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McInnes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Symmons-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symmons 2002</LINK>). RA can affect all joints in the body. The natural course of the disease is a slow but inexorable deterioration in physical condition, leading to difficulty in activities of daily living and poor quality of life. Rheumatoid arthritis is a multi-system disease that can affect internal organs, causing premature death. With adequate treatment targeted towards strongly reducing or abolishing inflammatory disease, many of these consequences can be prevented.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The term 'balneotherapy' comes from the Latin 'balneum' (bath). The term is classically used in (Eastern) European countries when natural mineral or thermal waters are used for bathing, drinking and inhalation. Recently a position paper was published with a proposal for, amongst others, a definition of balneotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gutenbrunner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutenbrunner 2010</LINK>). One of the core elements of balneotherapy is the use of (natural) mineral waters, gases and peloids (including packs = local application of peloids), often in health resorts (spas). In most European countries, balneotherapy often takes place at centres with thermal baths or seawater baths (<LINK REF="REF-Gutenbrunner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutenbrunner 2010</LINK>). In Israel, the main health resort area is located along the western shore of the Dead Sea. The unique environmental conditions in this area are considered beneficial for patients suffering from rheumatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sukenik-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sukenik 1994a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Homeric times, baths were applied primarily to cleanse and refresh. At the time of Hippocrates, bathing was regarded as more than a simple hygienic measure. It was considered beneficial in curing most illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tubergen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tubergen 2001</LINK>). The Romans used water for treatment of orthopaedic conditions, but after the Roman era, spa therapy fell into disuse. In the sixteenth century, baths were rediscovered. Since that time, spa therapy has been practised continuously in the management of musculoskeletal conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tubergen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tubergen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Balneotherapy is prescribed most often for patients with any form of arthritis, including fibromyalgia. Positive effects have been mentioned in the treatment of psoriasis as well (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buskila-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buskila 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exercise in warm (tap) water is usually called 'hydrotherapy' or 'aquatic therapy'. This Cochrane review focuses on balneotherapy only, which consists of bathing in natural mineral or thermal waters, using mudpacks or doing both.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>The mechanism by which balneotherapy might work is not clear. Water (thermal water, sea water) is generally used at a temperature of between 34°C and 36°C (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutenbrunner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutenbrunner 2010</LINK>). Hydrostatic force (Archimedes' principle) brings about relative pain relief by reducing loading (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2009</LINK>); water reduces gravity in painful and rheumatic joints. The warmth and buoyancy of water may block nociception by acting on thermal receptors and mechanoreceptors (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 2005</LINK>). Warm water may also enhance blood flow, which is thought to help in dissipating algogenic chemicals, and may facilitate muscle relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Kamioka-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamioka 2010</LINK>). Apart from these mechanical and thermal mechanisms, one should not undervalue the psychological mechanisms of the spa environment. The related mental relaxation may also play a role in pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of balneotherapy is to improve the range of joint motion, relieve muscle spasm, maintain or improve functional mobility, soothe pain and, as a consequence, relieve patients' suffering and help them feel well (<LINK REF="REF-Fam-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutenbrunner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutenbrunner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jagger-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jagger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sukenik-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sukenik 1994a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why is it important to do this review?</HEADING>
<P>No cure for RA is known at present, so treatment often focuses on management of symptoms such as pain, stiffness and mobility. Treatment options include pharmacological interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Colebatch-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colebatch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurkmans-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurkmans 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruiz-Garcia-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz Garcia 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittle 2011</LINK>), physical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Han-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2004</LINK>) and balneotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2008</LINK>). Since our last publication of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2008</LINK>), several systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effectiveness of balneotherapy have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forestier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forestier 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamioka-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamioka 2010</LINK>). These reviews either combine balneotherapy and hydrotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Forestier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forestier 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamioka-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamioka 2010</LINK>) or combine different diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite its popularity, reported scientific evidence on the effectiveness or efficacy of balneotherapy is sparse. This review evaluates the benefits and harms of balneotherapy in patients with RA.</P>

<P>The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was based upon five domains and was downgraded by one level for each of these factors when encountered: (1) limitations in design, (2) indirectness of evidence (i.e. generalisability of findings), (3) unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (significant statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%) or inconsistent findings among studies, (4) imprecision (total number of participants &lt; 300 for each outcome) and (5) high probability of publication bias. Two review authors (SMSB-Z,APV) determined these factors. We considered single randomised studies (n &lt; 300 for dichotomous outcomes and n &lt; 400 for continuous outcomes) to be inconsistent and imprecise and to provide &#8220;low-quality evidence&#8221;, which could be further downgraded to "very low-quality evidence" for limitations in design (i.e. high risk of bias), indirectness or other considerations. We applied the following levels of quality of evidence.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change the level of evidence. Data are sufficient and have narrow confidence intervals. No reporting biases are known or suspected; all domains were fulfilled.</LI>

In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1996</LINK>), investigators used a 'quality of life' instrument (Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) or AIMS2).

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data presented in the papers, even after communication with the study authors, were too scarce to enable 'between-group' analysis in almost half the studies. Also the studies used different interventions or comparison treatments and a wide variety of outcome measures; therefore interventions and outcome measures were considered heterogeneous.</P>
<P>One study assessed arms of balneotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Yurtkuran-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yurtkuran 1999</LINK>); only one participant complained of headache. In this study, most side effects were found in the control group (Cyclosporin A); between 4% and 16% of participants experienced various side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbance (one participant; 4%) and nephrotoxicity (four participants; 16%) (<LINK REF="STD-Yurtkuran-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yurtkuran 1999</LINK>).</P>

Physical disability was not reported. Also no data were presented on improvement, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events.</P>
<P>Two studies (n = 76) included a control group receiving no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sukenik-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Sukenik 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukenik-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sukenik 1995</LINK>). Both studies suffer from high risk of bias and low power; short-term improvement was mentioned in all treatment groups compared with control groups for most outcome measures (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). No data were provided on pain, improvement, physical disability, number of tender and swollen joints, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events. The study authors' conclusion of improvement was based on pre/post analysis. Data on harm or side effects were not reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials comparing different types of balneotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared mineral baths versus tapwater baths (<LINK REF="STD-Elkayam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elkayam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2007</LINK>). We were able to pool the data from two studies (n = 194) evaluating the effectiveness of additional radon in carbon dioxide baths (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franke-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no statistically significant differences post treatment and at three months in pain intensity on a VAS, but a statistically significant difference in pain in favour of additional radon at six-month follow-up only, with a difference of 9.6 mm on a 100-mm VAS (95% CI 1.6 to 17.6). Both effect estimates show no clinically relevant differences (&gt; 15%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no differences post treatment and at three months in terms of improvement in pain frequency on a 4-point scale (no, sporadic, daily, continuous) or improvement in one or more categories, but a significant difference of only 30% in favour of additional radon at six-month follow-up (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.7) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For all other outcomes (physical disability, tender joints, swollen joints, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events), no data were provided.</P>
<P>Therefore we conclude that moderate-level evidence (downgraded because of imprecision (low power)) shows unclear benefit in terms of pain at end of treatment and at three-month follow-up, but benefit of additional radon in carbon dioxide baths for the treatment of participants with RA at six months, although the clinical relevance of this benefit is small. We found low-level evidence (single study) of unclear benefit for improvement at end of treatment and at three-month follow-up, but benefit of additional radon in carbon dioxide baths in the treatment of patients with RA at six months.</P>
<P>Two studies (n = 76) compared Dead Sea salt baths versus normal salt baths (<LINK REF="STD-Sukenik-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Sukenik 1990a</LINK>) or sulphur baths (<LINK REF="STD-Sukenik-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sukenik 1995</LINK>), and another study (n = 30) compared sulphur baths versus mudpacks (<LINK REF="STD-Sukenik-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Sukenik 1990b</LINK>). All three studies did not provide sufficient data on pain, improvement, physical disability, number of tender and swollen joints, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events for the analysis. The authors of original studies mentioned short-term improvement in all treatment groups on most outcome measurements, but a more profound effect in the groups receiving mineral baths. All studies were of low power, performed a pre/post analysis and presented only point estimates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials comparing balneotherapy versus other treatments (e.g. exercise, oral medication)</HEADING>
<P>In one study (n = 35 in each study arm), 'balneotherapy' (seated immersion) was compared with hydrotherapy (exercise in water), land exercise or relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1996</LINK>). Here balneotherapy was performed with tapwater at 36°C (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no statistically significant differences in pain (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.42) and physical disability (MD -0.70, 95% CI -1.50 to 0.10). No data were provided on improvement, tender joints, swollen joints, withdrawal due to adverse events or serious adverse events.</P>
<P>Therefore we conclude that a very low level of evidence (single study and downgraded because of limitations in design (high risk of bias)) shows unclear benefit of tapwater bathing over relaxation, exercise or hydrotherapy.</P>
<P>In another study (n = 57), balneotherapy was compared with drug therapy (Cyclosporin A (CsA) 3.5 mg/kg) (<LINK REF="STD-Yurtkuran-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yurtkuran 1999</LINK>). We found no statistically significant differences in terms of pain (0 to 100 VAS) (MD 8, 95% CI -17.54 to 1.54) or swollen joints (MD 1.50, 95% CI -1.25 to 4.25) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). We found a statistically significant benefit of mineral baths in terms of overall improvement at eight weeks of 54% (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.83) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) and significant benefit of Cyclosporin A at eight weeks in terms of the number of tender joints (MD 8.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 14) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). For all other outcome measures (physical disability, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events), no data were provided.</P>
<P>Very low-level evidence (single study and downgraded because of limitations in design (high risk of bias)) suggests some benefit of mineral baths over Cyclosporin A concerning overall improvement, and of Cyclosporin A over mineral baths in terms of the number of swollen joints.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review evaluated the benefits and harms of balneotherapy in patients with RA. Concerning pain, number of tender joints, &#8216;response rate&#8217; or improvement, no statistically significant differences were found between mudpacks for the hand and placebo mudpacks (very low level of evidence) or for bathing with tapwater over relaxation, exercise or hydrotherapy (very low level of evidence). Harms were not reported for this comparison.</P>
<P>In terms of pain, some benefit has been associated with additional radon in carbon dioxide baths for the treatment of patients with RA, but the clinical relevance of this benefit is small (moderate level of evidence). Regarding all other outcome measures (improvement, disability, tender joints, swollen joints, withdrawal due to adverse events or serious adverse events), we conclude that the benefit of either form of balneotherapy over another is inconclusive.</P>
<P>For pain, a very low level of evidence of unclear benefit was found. For overall improvement, we found some benefit of balneotherapy over drug treatment (very low level of evidence). In this comparison, withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive and disabling disease that has great impact on quality of life. When balneotherapy is evaluated, the outcome measures used and the follow-up period chosen should be adequate. The main aims of balneotherapy are to maintain or improve functional mobility, soothe pain and let patients feel well. Often a standard set of outcome measures was used. In daily life, patients are trying to deal with pain by using coping strategies. Pain (often assessed by the patient) was reported as an outcome measure in the Methods sections of most studies, but results were seldom reported. A 'quality of life' assessment was reported in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1996</LINK>). This is surprising because one of the aims of balneotherapy, or therapy for patients with chronic disease in general, is to improve health-related 'quality of life'. The question can be raised whether the outcome measures used in most studies were specific and responsive enough to enable measurement of treatment effect. Also the follow-up period seems to be rather short. Positive effects of spa therapy have been found in patients with ankylosing spondylitis even after 40 weeks of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tubergen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tubergen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>We noted heterogeneity of the intervention 'balneotherapy'. Once balneotherapy consisted of tapwater, once as mineral baths (38°C, daily for 20 minutes) + mudpacks (for 20 minutes), twice as radon/carbon dioxide baths (15 times in four weeks, for 20 minutes), twice as Dead Sea baths (daily for 20 to 30 minutes), twice as sulphur baths (daily for 20 minutes), once as a combination of Dead Sea and sulphur baths, once as a combination of sulphur baths + mudpacks (see table of included studies) and once as only mudpacks. This makes it difficult to determine what the most effective form of balneotherapy is, or even whether an essential element (minerals) in the water is responsible for its effectiveness.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unfortunately, most studies showed methodological flaws resulting in high risk of bias. Also data presentation was often lacking. When information concerning trial design, especially regarding strategies to avoid bias, is lacking, we could not exclude possible bias in the trial. Therefore, a robust analysis of the effectiveness of balneotherapy cannot be presented.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review might very well suffer from selection bias based on language. We found several studies that were presented in Hebrew, Japanese or one of the Eastern European languages. Often the English abstract was lacking information about the design of the study. These studies are all awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>We used the criteria of the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG) for risk of bias assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). This tool is a slightly extended version of the one described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, although with some sub-items in the different domains, easing the risk of bias assessment. In previous versions of the review, we used the Delphi list, which is comparable with the risk of bias assessment tool of the CBRG (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>). Therefore we observed no major differences concerning risk of bias assessment between the previous version and the current version of the review. Overall this risk of bias assessment tool can be regarded as a reliable and valid instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2001</LINK>). Nevertheless misclassification is always a possibility.</P>
<P>The 'spa environment' is an important factor in treatment results (<LINK REF="REF-Balint-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balint 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sukenik-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sukenik 1994a</LINK>). Many factors may contribute positively to reported effects (<LINK REF="REF-Fam-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fam 1991</LINK>), such as changes in environment, the 'spa scenery', absence of (house)work duties, physical and mental relaxation, the non-competitive atmosphere with similarly suffering companions, physical therapy and so forth. As such, any benefit of the spa could perhaps be attributed also to the effects of factors unrelated to the "water" therapy per se.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusion of this review that evidence is still insufficient to show the effectiveness of balneotherapy is consistent with the conclusion of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamioka-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karag_x00fc_lle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karagülle 2004</LINK>). Although the selection criteria differ between reviews, all review authors conclude that poor methodological quality and scarce data presentation make it impossible to draw firm conclusions. The more recent studies are of better methodological rigour, but additional studies are needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:38:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Balneotherapy is one of the oldest forms of therapy for patients with arthritis. On pain, we found a low level of evidence of benefit for mineral baths when compared with drug treatment at eight weeks and a moderate level of evidence of benefit of additional radon in carbon dioxide baths for the treatment of patients with RA. Most studies report positive findings but provide insufficient evidence to support their claims. Scientific evidence is insufficient because of high risk of bias in most studies and absence of an adequate statistical analysis.  </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-01 08:39:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<UL>
<LI>Large studies with low risk of bias are needed, focusing on appropriate allocation concealment, blinding and adequate data presentation and analysis. The design and reporting of future trials should conform to CONSORT guidelines.</LI>
<LI>New research should at a minimum use the agreed upon core set of outcome measures for RA supplemented with further specific measures relevant to capture the patient experience, documented to be adequate with the patient responsive to the treatment under study. Follow-up should be of sufficient length to assess long-term effects.</LI>
<LI>New research should provide full data on outcome measures, including mean and standard deviation or 95% confidence interval.</LI>
<LI>Future research should examine the effects of balneotherapy not only in pragmatic trials comparing various interventions with each other, but also in more explanatory trials comparing intervention groups versus a no-treatment control group. When possible, the beneficial effect of the 'spa environment' should be considered as a confounder or an effect modifier and accounted for in the design of the trial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We conclude that performing randomised studies with low risk of bias concerning the effectiveness of balneotherapy is both possible and necessary to provide strong evidence on the effects of balneotherapy.</P>

<P>We read with great interest the Cochrane review on balneotherapy (or spa therapy) for rheumatoid arthritis by Verhagen et al. [1]. However, we would like to address the points below that should be considered when interpreting the results and conclusions of this review.</P>
<P>1) The review authors considered the intervention of control group as a placebo in a trial included in the review, which tested mud compress therapy for the hands of rheumatoid arthritis patients [2]. However, the intervention of control group in that study was heated attenuated mud compress not a placebo [2]. Indeed, that study aimed to investigate whether mineral content of mud would have any additional benefit in the heated mud compress therapy. In other words, the control group received &#8216;heated&#8217; attenuated mud compress; and since that therapy had thermal effect, categorizing that control therapy as a placebo was inappropriate. Therefore, the results and conclusions regarding the &#8220;balneotherapy versus placebo or no treatment&#8221; should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, this inappropriate reporting may be originated from lack of knowledge of basic characteristics of balneological interventions, which include balneotherapy (mineral water immersion), peloidotherapy/mud therapy (medical peloid or mud applications), hydropinotherapy (mineral water drinking), inhalation therapy (mineral water inhalation) and hydrotherapy (tap water immersion and exercise), if not from lack of caution to distinguish active from inactive control intervention. Furthermore, the results of the review do not match those from the original study in terms of response rate (improvement). The original paper reported statistically significant differences (please see Table 4 in original study) [2]; however, the review authors&#8217; analysis revealed no significant differences. We believe that this discrepancy should have mentioned and explained in the review and needs clarification.</P>
<P>2) The review authors wrongly defined one of the investigated interventions of a study as balneotherapy. However, the tested intervention in reality was hydrotherapy since tap water was used not mineral water [3]. In fact, that study aimed to investigate whether hydrotherapy in form of aquatic exercise would result in a greater therapeutic benefit than hydrotherapy in form of seated passive immersion, land exercise or progressive relaxation [3]. Therefore, classification of that intervention as balneotherapy was ill-chosen since the water used was not a mineral water. We think that this inaccurate classification additionally must have contributed the heterogeneity of the balneotherapy interventions observed in the review. Thereby, the results and conclusions regarding the &#8220;balneotherapy versus other treatments&#8221; should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, this approach is not well-structured definition, and once again, may indicate lack of interpretation of even the basic characteristics and application modes of balneological interventions. (see above).</P>
<P>3) The conclusions of the review authors on two radon therapy studies [4, 5] should also be read with caution: &#8220;adding radon to carbon dioxide baths did not improve pain intensity at three months but may improve overall well-being and pain at six months compared with carbon dioxide baths without radon, but this may have happened by chance.&#8221; However, they failed to explain why the results of these two studies with low risk of bias might have happened by chance. The review authors should have explained the scientific rationale and evidence for attributing the differences to the chance. On the other hand, the radon studies by Franke and colleagues are spa therapy trials, in which both groups stayed in a spa resort and received balneotherapy (either baths with natural mineral water rich in radon and carbondioxide or artificially produced carbondioxide baths of the same carbondioxide concentration to maintain the blinding of patients and to investigate specific effects of radon), diseases-specific exercises, physiotherapy, massage therapy, hydrogalvanic baths and were offered occupational therapy, leisure time sports and relaxation therapy [4, 5]. In other words, the groups have undertaken the same package of multiple interventions plus balneotherapy (radon+carbondioxide or only carbondioxide); this may explain why the expected effect size would be small which was correctly reported in those two studies.</P>
<P>4) The review authors wrongly stated that information about adverse events was not reported in a radon spa therapy study [5] and a balneotherapy study [6], in plain language summary section. However, these studies have reported the adverse events. We believe that that information should be mentioned to provide more comprehensive information on harms of balneotherapy or spa therapy.</P>
<P>5) Due to concerns raised above, the results and conclusions of the Cochrane review on balneotherapy (or spa therapy) for rheumatoid arthritis may mislead the readers. The Cochrane Handbook states that review teams must include expertise in the topic area being reviewed [7]; accordingly we would suggest review teams should include expertise in the balneological interventions when further reviews on the safety and effectiveness of any balneological intervention will be being conducted, particularly for distinguishing active from inactive control intervention or hydrotherapy (tap water immersion) from balneotherapy (mineral water immersion), which were confused in this review.</P>

<P>Thank you very much for your thorough reading of the review and your comments. We know that these comments come from people that are warm advocates of balneotherapy and we respect their opinion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Question 1: </HEADING>
<P>The comments concern here are the subgrouping used in our review, the definition of &#8216;balneotherapy&#8217; and the results from the Codish study.</P>
<P>First, we had preplanned stratified analyses that included: a) versus no treatment or waiting list controls; b) versus other types of balneotherapy; and c) versus other treatment(s). We classified the study of Codish et al under a) as it compared mineral rich versus mineral depleted mudpacks. The latter we considered a placebo as the authors described that they did their best to make both interventions look like the same (The appearance, size, weight, and texture of both compress types were identical), but we agree that that was our own decision. I agree with Mr Karagulle that the using the term &#8216;placebo&#8217; might not be correct for the intervention in the control group. Nevertheless, we do think this study is in the correct subgroup. Only the wording would change, not the results.</P>
<P>Next Dr Karagulle states he is not happy with our definition of &#8216;balneotherapy&#8217;. I know there is no universally accepted definition of balneotherapy and the one Dr Karagulle proposes is broader than the one we used. We followed an international consensus that declared: &#8220;One of the core elements of balneotherapy is the use of (natural) mineral waters, gases and peloids (including packs = local application of peloids)&#8221;. This is why we defined balneotherapy as follows: &#8220;Balneotherapy is defined as bathing in natural mineral or thermal waters (e.g. mineral baths, sulphur baths, Dead Sea baths), using mudpacks or doing both.&#8221; Although our definition is less broad compared to the one proposed by Dr Karagulle, the fact remains that Codish et al evaluated the effectiveness of additional minerals in mudpacks, which methodological will always need to be categorized in the subgroup: versus no treatment or waiting list controls.</P>
<P>Lastly Dr Karagulle states that Codish et al found statistical significant differences in response rate as outcome. This is correct, but we used in our analysis the data under the para of &#8216;patient global assessment&#8217;. This outcome measure is recommended as a core outcome in many studies, so future trials can add to this outcome. The response rate in Codish et al is a difficult rating system, including the physician rating. We consider this responder definition unique (definitely not corresponding to the recommended definition by the OARSI) and incorrect. Therefore we refrained from using this outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Question 2:</HEADING>
<P>Here the comments concern the inclusion of a study that, according to Dr Karagulle, should not be included. I know that the aim of the study of Hall et al was to evaluate the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, which we did not consider balneotherapy. Nevertheless one of the original control arms of Hall et al fell within our definition of balneotherapy, namely: &#8220;bathing in mineral or thermal waters&#8221; (seated immersion). This (control) intervention arm became therefore our intervention under study.</P>
<P>Inclusion of this study was, nevertheless, under heavy debate within our group, so I can understand the comments of Dr Karagulle et al. Nevertheless, our conclusion about the heterogeneity of balneotherapy interventions concerned all included studies, excluding this one would not change our conclusion.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Question 3</HEADING>
<P>This comment addresses the statement of us: &#8220;this may have happened by chance&#8221;, and the difference in interventions in both studies of Franke et al.</P>
<P>First, we made this statement &#8220;by chance&#8221;, only in the plain language section as we needed to reflect the fact that these results are not very firm. We are willing to choose another formulation next update.</P>
<P>Second, indeed the patients in the studies of Franke et al received a multimodal treatment package, with the only difference between groups was the addition of radon. Therefore this radon can be held responsible for the treatment differences, exactly what the authors state they would like to know. The small effect sizes are therefore not due to the multimodal treatment package as everyone received it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Question 4</HEADING>
<P>Dr Karagulle is right, we meant to state in the plain language summary that there were no side effects reported in the study of Franke 2007, not that the information about side effects was lacking, as the authors indeed stated there were no side effects. We have adjusted the text in the plain language summary. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Question 5</HEADING>
<P>We respectfully disagree with dr Karagulle, I do not think that our conclusions are unjustified and may mislead the reader. We also included two experts in the topic area: J Lambeck and J Cardoso, so I think we followed the Cochrane handbook.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the biggest challenge in this area is that we need large studies with low risk of bias, and we hope and encourage Dr Karagulle and his team to fill this gap of knowledge.</P>
