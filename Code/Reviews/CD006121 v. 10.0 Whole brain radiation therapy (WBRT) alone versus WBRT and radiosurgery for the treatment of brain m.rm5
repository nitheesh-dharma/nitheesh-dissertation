<TITLE MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">Is adding focused radiation (radiosurgery) to whole brain radiation therapy beneficial to people with brain metastases?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:26:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>The issue</B>
<BR/>The benefit of adding stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), which is non-surgical targeted radiation therapy, to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), where radiation is given to the whole brain when tumours cannot be removed by surgery, for people with brain metastases is unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>The aim of the review</B>
<BR/>We sought to determine whether adding SRS to WBRT is beneficial compared to WBRT alone in the treatment of brain metastases.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main findings?</B>
<BR/>We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are studies that randomly assign participants into different treatment groups, that looked at whether adding focused (targeted) radiation (radiosurgery) to WBRT is beneficial to people with brain metastases. Overall, participants who underwent WBRT and SRS did not survive longer than participants who were treated with WBRT alone. However, participants with high functional status to perform activities of daily life and those with a single metastasis did survive longer after SRS and WBRT. Participants treated with WBRT and SRS did experience improved local control and performance status, as well as decreased steroid use compared to participants treated with WBRT alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The overall quality of the evidence was moderate based on the GRADE assessments for our outcomes of interest, and the overall risk of bias was unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the conclusions?</B>
<BR/>Most of our conclusions are based on the results of one large trial with unclear risk of bias and therefore, we cautiously make the following remarks: we found that when radiosurgery was added to WBRT, there was no evidence to suggest that people lived any longer than if they had WBRT alone, except for people with only one brain metastasis (who may live longer if they receive the combination treatment). People having combination treatment also seemed to function better in daily life, their treated tumors were associated with having less chance of growing back, and they had to take less steroid medication. The side effects of combined therapy and WBRT alone were similar.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:24:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Historically, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been the main treatment for brain metastases. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers high-dose focused radiation and is being increasingly utilized to treat brain metastases. The benefit of adding SRS to WBRT is unclear. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 9, 2012.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:24:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To assess the efficacy of WBRT plus SRS versus WBRT alone in the treatment of adults with brain metastases.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:24:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>For the original review, in 2009 we searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CancerLit in order to identify trials for inclusion in this review. For the first update the searches were updated in May 2012.</P>
<P>For this update, in May 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in order to identify trials for inclusion in the review.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:25:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We restricted the review to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared use of WBRT plus SRS versus WBRT alone for upfront treatment of adults with newly diagnosed metastases (single or multiple) in the brain resulting from any primary, extracranial cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:25:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We used the generic inverse variance method, random-effects model in Review Manager 5 for the meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-08 10:20:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We identified three studies and one abstract for inclusion but we could only include two studies, with a total of 358 participants in a meta-analysis. This found no difference in overall survival (OS) between the WBRT plus SRS and WBRT alone groups (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.02; 2 studies, 358 participants; moderate-quality evidence). For participants with one brain metastasis median survival was significantly longer in the WBRT plus SRS group (6.5 months) versus WBRT group (4.9 months; P = 0.04). Participants in the WBRT plus SRS group had decreased local failure compared to participants who received WBRT alone (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 2 studies, 129 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Furthermore, we observed an improvement in performance status scores and decrease in steroid use in the WBRT plus SRS group (risk ratio (RR) 0.64 CI 0.42 to 0.97; 1 study, 118 participants; low-quality evidence). Unchanged or improved Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) at six months was seen in 43% of participants in the combined therapy group versus only 28% in the WBRT-alone group (RR 0.78 CI 0.61 to 1.00; P value = 0.05; 1 study, 118 participants; low-quality evidence). Overall, risk of bias in the included studies was unclear.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:25:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Since the last version of this review we have identified one new study that met the inclusion criteria. However, due to a lack of data from this study we were not able to include it in a meta-analysis. Given the unclear risk of bias in the included studies, the results of this analysis have to be interpreted with caution. In our analysis of all included participants, SRS plus WBRT did not show a survival benefit over WBRT alone. However, performance status and local control were significantly better in the SRS plus WBRT group. Furthermore, significantly longer OS was reported in the combined treatment group for recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I patients as well as patients with single metastasis. Most of our outcomes of interest were graded as moderate-quality evidence according to the GRADE criteria and the risk of bias in the majority of included studies was mostly unclear.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:26:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Library (Issue 6, 2010 and Issue 9, 2012) on whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) alone versus WBRT plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of brain metastases.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:26:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Approximately 20% to 40% of people with cancer will go on to develop brain metastases (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2003</LINK>). Primary tumor histologies most commonly include non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Chidel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chidel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flickinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flickinger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pirzkall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pirzkall 1998</LINK>). The median survival of people after diagnosis of brain metastases is less than six months (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:26:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Historically, WBRT has been utilized as the main treatment modality for the management of brain metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sneed-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sneed 1999</LINK>). Before WBRT, survival rates averaged one to two months with the administration of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pirzkall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pirzkall 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsao-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsao 2012</LINK>). The addition of WBRT to steroids extended median survival to three to six months (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flickinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flickinger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sneed-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sneed 1999</LINK>). However, in the last decade there has been mounting evidence enumerating the toxic effects of WBRT, especially serious neuro-cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2003</LINK>). We identified three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one abstract for inclusion in this review. Two of these RCTs of people with solitary brain metastasis showed that combined treatment of surgical resection (craniotomy) with WBRT improved survival rates and led to greater local tumor control than WBRT alone (<LINK REF="REF-Flickinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flickinger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pirzkall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pirzkall 1998</LINK>). It has since been suggested that WBRT and SRS together could produce similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Sneed-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sneed 1999</LINK>). SRS, developed by Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell in 1951, is a technique that focuses high-dose radiation at precise intracranial targets (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>). Radiosurgical procedures are non-invasive, provide excellent local tumor control, and can be used to treat multiple tumors with minimal dose overlapping (<LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:26:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>In the past, WBRT has been the standard treatment for brain metastases; however, SRS is being increasingly used for the management of brain metastases. How and in what situations these two treatments should be combined or used individually remains to be definitively answered. Therefore, defining the role of SRS in the management of people with brain metastases has become critical.</P>

<P>For the original review, in 2009 we searched the following electronic databases in the following order to identify trials for inclusion: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2009, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009) (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), Embase (1980 to 2009) (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) and CancerLit (1975 to 2003) (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>)</P>
<P>We searched the following electronic databases in May 2012 for the first update and May 2017 for this update to identify new trials for inclusion: CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 5, in the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>), MEDLINE (Ovid) (May 2012 to May week 1 2017) (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>), and Embase (Ovid) (May 2012 to 2017 week 20) (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>). We employed a standard strategy to search each electronic database. We created three separate search 'buckets' using the 'OR' operator, that focused on identifying RCTs, diseases of interest, and interventions of interest. We then combined all three buckets using the 'AND' operator to yield the final data bucket and eliminated duplicates and non-human applications. Please note: elements of the search strategies have been adopted from those detailed in <LINK REF="REF-Hart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>For MEDLINE search strategies, terms one to 10 were originally devised and have been revised by Carol Lefebvre at the UK Cochrane Centre for the identification of all randomized and clinical controlled trials. For further source detail, please see <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified all relevant articles that we had found on PubMed and carried out a further search for newly published articles using the 'related articles' feature.</P>
<P>The review author team developed and executed the search strategies for the original review. For this and the previous update, Jane Hayes and Jo Platt, Information Specilaists for Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers revised the search strategies and ran the searches.<BR/>

<P>Four RCTs met our inclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Chougule-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chougule 2000</LINK> was presented in abstract form only and included 109 participants who were randomized into WBRT-alone, WBRT plus SRS and SRS-alone groups. No difference in overall median survival was reported in the WBRT-alone and WBRT plus SRS groups. Local control was reported as being superior in the WBRT plus SRS group (91%) versus 62% in the WBRT-alone group. No other outcomes were evaluated in this trial. The abstract only reported median survival and local control in the different groups without providing P values or Kaplan-Meier analysis. We could not obtain any further details about the trial from the authors. Hence, we did not include this RCT in the current meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> was a single-institution RCT that compared outcomes among participants receiving WBRT plus SRS (n = 21), WBRT alone (n = 21), and SRS alone (n = 18). This trial included participants aged 70 or less with KPS <U>of</U> 70% or more and with one to three brain metastases less than 4 cm on contrast-enhanced MRI scan. This study evaluated OS, local control and treatment-related morbidity. There was no difference in six-month, 12-month and median OS between the three treatment groups; however, subgroup analysis indicated that WBRT plus SRS (15 months) provided a survival benefit to participants with tumors 3 cm or less in diameter versus WBRT alone (5 months) (P = 0.002). Participants with controlled primary disease who received WBRT plus SRS (12 months) also demonstrated a survival benefit compared to WBRT alone (5.5 months) and SRS alone (8 months) (P = 0.027). Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> showed that the WBRT plus SRS group (42.9%) had better local control at one year compared to the WBRT-alone group (19%) and SRS alone group (22.2%) (P = 0.04). Of note, WBRT plus SRS (12 months) provided the most local control benefit to participants with brain metastasis less than 3 cm in diameter compared to WBRT alone (6 months) and SRS alone (3 months) (P = 0.004). Acute and late toxicities were similar among treatment groups. Unfortunately, we could not include this trial in the meta-analysis due to lack of available data from the original trial team.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis included two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>) that randomized 358 participants who were assessed at the end of the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> was by far the largest and only Phase III multi-institutional RCT to compare outcomes in participants who received WBRT plus SRS (n = 164) versus WBRT alone (n = 167). This trial included adults with one to three brain metastases with KPS more than 70%. Outcomes reported included OS, local control, KPS, cause of death, steroid requirement, and neurologic performance. OS was stratified for participants with one metastasis and more than one metastasis. In addition <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> stratified survival according to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class. RPA class prognosticates survival and outcomes in people with brain metastases. RPA Class 1 describes people who have a KPS of 70% or more, controlled primary status, age less than 65 years, and have no extracranial disease. <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> analyzed RPA Class I participants separately and reported significantly longer survival in the WBRT-plus-SRS group (11.6 months) versus WBRT (9.6 months) (P = 0.045). No such stratification was available in the other studies.</P>
<P>In the 2017 search we identified Sperduto 2014 (see <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> for reference), which was categorized as an additional report because it was a secondary analysis of participants from <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>, stratified by the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) but not included in the meta analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK> was a single-institution RCT that was stopped following an interim analysis of 27 participants that revealed a significant benefit in the rate of local control in the WBRT-plus-SRS group. This trial included participants with two to four brain metastases that were 25 mm or less. Local tumor control was the primary outcome and OS was also evaluated. No other outcomes were assessed. Follow-up MRI scans were read by an independent, blinded observer. This trial found a difference in local control of tumors in the WBRT-plus-SRS group compared to the WBRT-alone group. Survival was similar in both groups.</P>

The addition of SRS to WBRT increased local control of tumors in all the included studies. Meta-analysis of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>), assessing 358 participants, found that participants receiving WBRT plus SRS had less chance of local failure than participants who received WBRT alone (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

The <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> trial evaluated acute (events that arose within 90 days from start of radiotherapy) and late toxicities (events that occurred three months after start of radiotherapy) in 21 participants in the WBRT plus SRS arm and 21 participants in the WBRT-alone arm. The WBRT-plus-SRS group reported &gt;more than Grade 2 headaches in 9.5% of participants and neurologic worsening without CNS progression in 9.5% of participants. There was a 9.5% rate of greater than Grade 2 headaches and 4.8% rate of neurologic worsening in participants randomized to the WBRT- alone arm. With respect to chronic toxicities, <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> reported incidence of radiation necrosis, brain edema, and neurologic worsening without progression as 4.8%, 4.8% and 9.5% of participants within the WBRT-plus-SRS group. Participants in the WBRT-alone arm were reported to have brain edema and neurologic worsening in 4.8% and 4.8% of cases, respectively. The <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> trial assessed acute and late toxicities in 166 and 112 participants, respectively, in the WBRT-alone group and 160 and 113 participants in the WBRT-plus-SRS group. Acute toxicities (within 90 days of treatment) were similar in the WBRT-plus-SRS group versus WBRT-alone group. They most commonly included skin changes, nausea or vomiting, and CNS deficit or toxicity. In the WBRT-plus-SRS group 43% of participants reported Grade I toxicity, 18% reported Grade 2 toxicity, 2% Grade 3 toxicity and 1% Grade 4 toxicity. In comparison, 36% of participants with WBRT alone reported Grade I toxicity and 26% reported Grade 2 toxicity. Similarly, late toxicities did not differ between treatment groups and most commonly included CNS deficit/toxicity.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-08 02:53:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, WBRT plus SRS did not significantly improve survival in people with brain metastases as compared to WBRT alone. Analysis of all included participants did not show a survival benefit from the addition of SRS to WBRT in either trial but there were survival benefits in subgroup analyses reported by the <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> studies. <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> is a single-center RCT whose subgroup analysis showed that WBRT plus SRS (15 months) provided a survival benefit to participants with tumors 3 cm or less in diameter versus WBRT alone (5 months) (P = 0.002). Participants with controlled primary disease who received WBRT plus SRS (12 months) also demonstrated a survival benefit compared to WBRT alone (5.5 months) and SRS alone (8 months). The large, multicenter cohort in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> showed that WBRT plus SRS statistically improved median survival in participants with single, unresectable metastatic foci as compared to WBRT alone. Of note, only <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> included and analyzed participants with single brain metastases. For participants with one brain metastasis, median survival was significantly longer in the WBRT-plus-SRS group (6.5 months) versus the WBRT-alone group (4.9 months). Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> analyzed RPA Class I participants separately and reported significantly longer survival in the WBRT-plus-SRS group (11.6 months) versus WBRT-alone (9.6 months). Participants with unresectable lesions (either located in deep gray matter or in areas of eloquent cortex) typically are treated with WBRT alone thereby missing the known advantage conferred by surgical resection plus WBRT. However, the data from this RCT suggests WBRT followed by radiosurgical boost similarly improves median survival in this oncologic niche.</P>
<P>In the analysis of all included participants, combined therapy improved local tumor control. Compared with WBRT alone, addition of SRS to WBRT increased local control of tumors in both studies included studies in the meta-analysis. When a treated tumor increased in size on follow-up MRI scan, it was deemed a local failure. <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK> discontinued their control treatment arm (WBRT alone) after interim analysis performed at the 60% accrual mark showed markedly improved local control in the combined treatment group. <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> showed that the WBRT-plus-SRS group (42.9%) had better local control at one year compared to the WBRT-alone group (19%) and SRS-alone group (22.2%). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> reported a 43% greater risk of local recurrence with WBRT alone. Our analysis showed that participants receiving WBRT plus SRS had significantly lower local failures compared to WBRT alone.</P>
<P>One of the most important clinical measures of treatment efficacy is performance status or functional outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> compared KPS scores before and six months after treatment (WBRT plus SRS or WBRT alone).  
Improvements in KPS scores was reported in the WBRT-plus-SRS group compared to the WBRT-alone group. Forty-three per cent of participants in the WBRT-plus-SRS group had unchanged or improved KPS at six months post-treatment versus only 28% in WBRT group. And although none of the trials indicated participant-reported measures of QoL, <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> assessed the need for long-term steroid use after three months status post intervention. They found that 65% of participants in the WBRT-plus-SRS group had decreased steroid use (and most were not taking steroids) compared to 45% with decreased steroid use in the WBRT-alone group. Decreased steroid requirement likely diminishes the associated comorbidities of long-term steroid use including weight gain, poor glycemic control, and successive increase in cardiovascular risk and may contribute to a better QoL or functional status.</P>
<P>Treatment-related morbidity did not change significantly with the addition of SRS to WBRT. <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> reported no significant differences in acute or chronic toxicities between participants in the WBRT-plus-SRS group and participants in the WBRT-alone group. <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK> reported "no neurologic or systemic morbidity related to SRS" and only mild scalp erythema and hair loss associated with WBRT. <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>, reported similar rates of acute toxicities (within 90 days of treatment) across treatment groups. Most commonly reported side effects included skin changes, nausea/vomiting, and CNS deficit/toxicity. Similarly, late toxicities did not differ between treatment groups and most commonly included CNS deficit/toxicity. <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> concluded that neither acute nor late toxicities increase significantly with the addition of SRS, further validating the addition of radiosurgical boost to WBRT without significant risk of harm to the patient.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>, trials were aimed at evaluating the precise question we were trying to answer in this review: is the addition of upfront SRS to WBRT better than WBRT alone? <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK> focused on local control as their primary outcome and their study was stopped because of the benefit seen in the WBRT-plus-SRS group. Therefore, their study was not powered to detect a difference in OS or any other outcomes. They did not assess functional outcome or QoL, which are extremely important primary outcomes in any palliative treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> conducted a large well-designed multicenter RCT and appropriately evaluated many key outcomes including, OS, local control, performance status, steroid requirement, and cause of death. <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> was a single-institution RCT that evaluated OS, local control and treatment-related morbidity among participants receiving WBRT plus SRS, WBRT alone, and SRS alone. Neurocognitive performance and overall QoL was not assessed adequately in any trial and needs to be the focus of future investigations. Since SRS and WBRT may have different effects on cognition, especially in long-term survivors, it is imperative that future trials use neurocognitive performance as one of their primary end points. These results should change current practice of WBRT alone for all people with multiple brain metastases, and SRS should be added as upfront treatment for selected patients.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:32:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Three RCTs, one large multicenter RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>) and two small single-institution RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK>), form the basis of our systematic review and its conclusions. Overall all studies had an unclear risk of bias and they satisfied at most only two of the criteria that we used to assess risk of bias. Given this risk of bias, the results and conclusions of our review have to be interpreted in the context of this uncertainty.</P>
<P>All three trials are consistent in showing that local control is superior in the WBRT-plus-SRS group compared to WBRT-alone group and that survival is similar in the two groups. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> assessed other outcomes such as performance status, steroid requirement, and cause of death. Conclusions based on these outcome measures are derived solely from this large multicenter RCT and may be prone to bias. For example, performance status was only assessed six months after treatment and hence may not accurately represent the performance status at other time points. <LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> did not investigate functional outcome, cognitive outcome, or QoL. Furthermore, the study by <LINK REF="STD-El-Gantery-2014" TYPE="STUDY">El Gantery 2014</LINK> could not be included in the meta-analysis due to lack of data available from the original trial team. Hence, the majority of the results and conclusions are based on a single large RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK>), which limits the internal validity of this systematic review.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:32:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We performed a comprehensive search, including a thorough search of the gray literature, and at least two review authors independently sifted all the studies and extracted data. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process. The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias, that is studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as the analyses were restricted to meta-analyses of a small number of trials or single trials.</P>
<P>Despite our best efforts, we were not able to get detailed data on one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Chougule-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chougule 2000</LINK>), which was published in abstract form. Therefore, data from this trial were not available for meta-analysis.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sanghavi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sanghavi 2001</LINK> reported improved survival in participants treated with WBRT plus SRS compared to WBRT alone in a large retrospective multi-institutional analysis. Participants with WBRT plus SRS and RPA Class I had median survival of 16.1 months versus 7.1 months (P &lt; 0.05). This result is in disagreement with our review and all three RCTs included in this review. It is very likely that there was a strong selection bias in this retrospective analysis. No other outcomes, such as local control, were evaluated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>, in a prospective non-RCT, evaluated outcomes in participants with single lung cancer metastasis. Three treatment groups, WBRT alone, SRS alone, and WBRT plus SRS, were compared. Similar to the <LINK REF="STD-Sanghavi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sanghavi 2001</LINK> study, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK> reported longer median survival in participants who received WBRT plus SRS (10.6 months) versus WBRT alone (5.7 months) (P &lt; 0.0001). <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK> reports superior local control and KPS along with a lower neurologic death rate in the WBRT-plus-SRS group compared to WBRT alone.</P>
<P>One retrospective study also reported a similar survival and local tumor control advantage in the WBRT-plus-SRS group compared to WBRT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Feng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Feng 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The OS advantage seen in these retrospective studies is again likely to be because of a strong selection bias in a non-RCT setting. Local control, KPS, and cause of death data appear to agree with the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2004</LINK> trial.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:33:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The conclusions we have presented are based on only three randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Since the last version of this review, one new study was found. The risk of bias in all of these trials was unclear. Therefore, our results and conclusions have to be interpreted in the context of unclear study bias. In an analysis of all included participants, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) did not show an overall survival (OS) benefit over WBRT alone. However, local control and functional outcome were significantly better in the WBRT-plus-SRS group. Furthermore, significantly longer OS was reported in the combined treatment group when tumors where less than 3 cm in maximum diameter, in whom primary cancer was controlled, and in recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I participants as well as participants with single metastasis. Finally, there was no increase in treatment toxicity with the addition of SRS to WBRT. Therefore, we conclude the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>people with tumors less than 3 cm in maximum diameter and in whom primary cancer is controlled should be treated with WBRT plus SRS;</LI>
<LI>people with a single unresectable brain metastasis should be treated with WBRT plus SRS;</LI>
<LI>people who are RPA Class I should be treated with WBRT plus SRS;</LI>
<LI>people with two to four brain metastases should be treated with WBRT plus SRS on the basis of better functional outcome, local control, and decreased steroid requirement.</LI>
</UL>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:33:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Further trials designed to have a low risk of bias and sufficient sample size are needed to affirm the results and conclusions of this systematic review. Future trials should also rigorously compare the QoL and cognitive performance of people undergoing WBRT plus SRS versus WBRT alone. Also, knowing the significant neurocognitive side effects of WBRT in long-term survivors, trials that omit upfront WBRT are being conducted.</P>
