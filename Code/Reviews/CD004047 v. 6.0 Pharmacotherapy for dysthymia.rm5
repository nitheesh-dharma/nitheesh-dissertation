</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Many drug treatments have been proposed for the treatment of dysthymia, but with so many potential comparisons it is not possible at the present time to determine which is the treatment of choice. There is a need to know whether the different classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy. In addition, the tolerability of treatments may be even more important, since dysthymia is a chronic condition characterised by less severe symptoms than major depression.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials comparing two or more active drug treatments for dysthymia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic searches of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT and LILACS, Biological Abstracts; reference searching; personal communication; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to compare at least two active drug treatments in the treatment of dysthymia. Exclusion criteria were: non-randomised studies, studies which included patients with mixed major depression/dysthymia and studies on depression/dysthymia secondary to other disorders (e.g. substance abuse).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of 14 trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. All studied drugs promoted similar clinical responses, although with different side effect profiles. The evidence for TCAs and SSRIs was the most robust, considering the number of trials and participants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made based on consideration of drug-specific side effect properties. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Many drug treatments have been proposed for the treatment of minor chronic depression - otherwise known as dysthymia (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition and the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4th edition (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). The first review in this series addressed the question of whether drugs are an effective treatment for dysthymia using placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This review aimed to assess the relative efficacy and acceptability of active pharmacological treatments for dysthymia.</P>
<P>A wide range of treatments have been proposed for dysthymia, including different classes of antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and stimulants. Some of these treatments have been compared in randomised controlled trials, but with so many potential comparisons it is not possible at the present time to determine which is the treatment of choice.</P>
<P>In the treatment of depression there is some evidence that different classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Magni-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magni 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howland-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howland 1991</LINK>). There is a need to determine whether this holds for dysthymia.</P>
<P>One important difference between treatments for depression which previous systematic reviews have identified is that some antidepressants are better tolerated than others (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1997</LINK>). This may have direct impact on cost-effectiveness. As dysthymia is a chronic condition characterised by less severe symptoms than major depression, the tolerability of treatments may be even more important than for major depression.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this study were:<BR/>i) To investigate the relative efficacy and dropout rates of different antidepressants and other pharmacological treatments in dysthymia<BR/>ii) Where possible, to perform a meta-analytic synthesis of the studies.</P>
<P>More specifically we aimed to test the following hypotheses:<BR/>i) Because dysthymia is an affective disorder we predicted that antidepressants would be more efficacious than other treatments (benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and stimulants).<BR/>ii) Newer antidepressants (specifically the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) would be better tolerated than older tricyclic antidepressants in terms of dropout from trials.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials which compared two or more active pharmacological treatments for dysthymia. Quasi-randomised trials were also included and a sensitivity analysis would compare the main results from these trials with those from randomised controlled trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People with any primary diagnosis of dysthymia: non-major depression of at least two years in duration. Participants with disorders such as depressive neurosis, depressive personality disorder, neurotic depression, persistent anxiety-depression, mild chronic depression and minor depression were also included as long as the duration of illness was longer than 2 years, irrespective of gender, age or nationality.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: where those with dysthymia and major depression were included together in the same study (not providing separate data for dysthymic patients), where depression was secondary to other disorders, for example substance abuse, and where the degree of affective illness fulfilled criteria for major depression.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1)Any antidepressant drugs:<BR/>a) Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs: desipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline, tianeptine, clomipramine, nortryptiline, dothiepin, doxepin, maprotiline, trazodone, trimipramine, amoxapine, lofepramine, viloxazine<BR/>b) Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and related drugs: phenelzine, isocarboxazide, tranylcypromine, moclobemide<BR/>c) SSRIs and related antidepressants: paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram.</P>
<P>2)Other drugs used in the treatment of depression<BR/>a) neuroleptics<BR/>b) tryptophan<BR/>c) benzodiazepines or other anxiolytic drugs (e.g. alprazolam)<BR/>d) lithium<BR/>e) stimulants: dexamphetamine sulphate, methylphenidate hydrochloride, pemoline</P>
<P>This list would be changed if our search found additional active treatments. Trials with combined drug therapies or augmentation were also included.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcomes of interest were: </P>
<P>1. Dysthymia changes at the end of trial<BR/>(a) improvement rates in the symptoms of dysthymia on any depression scale<BR/>(b) absence of sufficient symptoms to meet diagnostic criteria for dysthymic disorder<BR/>(c) score of 'very much improved' or 'much improved' on CGI scale<BR/>(d) group mean scores on HRSD scale<BR/>(e) group mean scores on any depression scale.</P>
<P>2. Acceptability of the treatment: measured by numbers of people dropping out during the trial and post-randomisation exclusions.</P>

<P>2. The register of trials kept by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group and the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group were also searched.</P>
<P>3. Personal Communication: in order to ensure that as many as possible RCTs and CCTs were identified, the authors of the included studies were consulted to find out if they knew of any published or unpublished RCTs/ CCTs of pharmacological treatment of dysthymia which were not yet identified. A list of all identified RCTs/ CCTs identified through consulting others' sources was sent to the authors.</P>
<P>4. Attempts were made to obtain unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Selection of trials<BR/>One reviewer (MSL) screened the abstracts of all publications which were obtained by the search strategy. A distinction was made between:<BR/>1) eligible studies, with any pharmacological treatments' comparison<BR/>2) pharmacological treatments without any control element, or general treatment studies rather than pharmacological.<BR/>For articles that were thought to be possible RCTs the full article was obtained and inspected to assess their relevance to this review based on the criteria for inclusion.</P>
<P>Quality assessment<BR/>In order to ensure that variation was not caused by systematic errors in the design of a study, the methodological quality of the selected trials was assessed by two independent reviewers (MSL and MH). The criteria based on the guidelines included in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook were used to assess the quality of the trials. It is based on the evidence of a strong relationship among the potential for bias in the results and the allocation concealment and is defined as below:<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment);<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results);<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).<BR/>In this first analysis, trials were included if they met the criteria A or B at the Handbook.</P>
<P>In a second quality assessment, a modified version of those from (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 1995</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 1996</LINK>) was used. In this scheme, studies were rated considering the following features:</P>
<P>a. degree to which randomisation was truly blind (allocation concealment)<BR/>b. degree to which assessor of outcome were blind to the treatment allocation<BR/>c. blinding of subjects or attempts to equalise expectations<BR/>d. length of acute phase of treatment<BR/>e. length of follow-up<BR/>f. assessment of compliance<BR/>g. clear definition of inclusion criteria (use of diagnostic criteria)<BR/>h. statement of criteria for improvement<BR/>i. treatment standardized or monitored<BR/>j. inclusion of data from subjects who withdrew after randomisation<BR/>k. control for baseline differences</P>
<P>Scores for the individual quality item were summed for the analysis. Discrepancies in the scores were resolved by consensus. The primary results of the review when employing these different rating scales were compared.</P>
<P>Data Management<BR/>Data were independently extracted by both reviewers. Any disagreement was discussed, the decisions documented and, where necessary, the authors of the studies contacted to help resolve the issue. All exclusion/ dropouts were identified whenever available in the report. If no information was available (either from the report or the authors) it was assumed that dropout was because of side effects/ treatment failure. The sensitivity of the results was tested to see if the inclusion of this assumption caused any substantial changes.<BR/>We expected that some trials would use a crossover design. In this case, in order to exclude the potential additive effect in the second or more stages on these trials only data from the first stage would be analysed. </P>
<P>Data Analysis<BR/>Relative risk analyses (with 95% CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcome data (relative risk was preferred to odds ratio as it is a more conservative statistic and appropriate where the outcome is not a rare event). When overall results were significant, the number needed to treat to produce one outcome was calculated by combining the overall relative risk with an estimate of the prevalence of the event in the control group of the trials. The estimates of relative risk were based on the random effects model.</P>
<P>Continuous outcomes were analysed according to their difference in mean treatment effects and its' standard error. If multiple outcome measures were described in a single study, for the purposes of pooling results, a single 'best available' outcome measure was chosen for each study, according to the authors' specification as the principle outcome or what was reported first. The effect sizes could be calculated using this best available outcome.</P>
<P>Meta-analytical methods for continuous data assume that the underlying distribution of the measurements is normal. The ratio of the mean to its' standard deviation gives a crude way of assessing skew: if this ratio was less than 1.65 for any group in a trial the results were log-transformed before being included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was assessed both by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating a test of heterogeneity. Two possible reasons for heterogeneity were pre-specified: (i) that response differed according to different lengths of follow-up; (ii) that response differed according to the different drugs. These would be assessed by looking at separate subgroups of trials [(i) and (ii)]. A further subgroup analysis would be conducted comparing 'dysthymic disorder' trials with 'minor depression/neurotic depression' trials if there were available data.</P>
<P>Tables were used to display characteristics of eligible trials including those that were excluded with the reasons for exclusion. Outcomes were also presented graphically. Review Manager software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was used to organise and process the results.</P>
<P>Statistical advice was provided by the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Search<BR/>The general search for this series of systematic reviews on the treatment of dysthymia generated 167 references which were related to trials with at least two active drug treatments being compared. 90 references were checked reading the full paper.<BR/>- Fourteen trials used diagnostic criteria for dysthymia and had evaluable data, which could be included in this review (1659 patients in total). Data from five (<LINK REF="STD-Bakish-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bakish 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>) have already been used for placebo comparisons in the first review (<LINK REF="REF-Lima-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2001</LINK>). <BR/>- 36 studies were excluded because the patients could not be considered as suffering from dysthymia or they did not describe appropriate methods of randomisation. </P>
<P>Design<BR/>All the included studies were described as randomised and used a parallel group design. Most of them (11) were double blind. The duration of the trials ranged from 4 weeks to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Settings<BR/>Four trials were conducted in the United States of America (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 1992</LINK>), one in Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Smeraldi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smeraldi 1996</LINK>), two in France (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guelfi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guelfi 1989</LINK>), one in Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1992</LINK>), one in Colombia (<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1994</LINK>), two in Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Vallejo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vallejo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otero-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Otero 1994</LINK>) and one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Bakish-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bakish 1993</LINK>). One trial was an International Multicenter Study (<LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>), involving three countries. One trial did not report the country where the trial was conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Salzmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzmann 1995</LINK>). <BR/>All trials studied outpatients from general practice, psychiatric clinics or from the community.</P>
<P>Participants<BR/>All trials included for the main comparisons used DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder. <BR/>The number of participants randomised in the trials ranged from 18 to 410. In two studies, patients had 'double depression' (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK>). In Smeraldi (<LINK REF="STD-Smeraldi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smeraldi 1996</LINK>), 15 patients from a total of 281 had major depression in partial remission. <BR/>Some studies selected subjects with very chronic illness (such as <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>). Stewart (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1989</LINK>) reported that 80% of patients also had atypical depression.</P>
<P>Comparisons<BR/>Seventeen different compounds were compared in the trials. Imipramine was the main comparison drug (six trials). Amisulpiride and fluoxetine were compared to other drugs in three studies; trazadone and phenelzine in two. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Otero-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Otero 1994</LINK>) an augmentation scheme was adopted (fluoxetine + bentazepam) and compared to fluoxetine alone. </P>
<P>Outcomes<BR/>All trialists used symptom scales in assessing treatment effects. The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) was the most widely used, followed by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). However, most of trials lacked data on standard deviations, and in other cases showed skewed data distribution. Continuous data from one study were provided by the author (<LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four dichotomous outcomes were used in this review. The most used dichotomous outcome was 'responder': for the majority of the included trials, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scoring 1 or 2 on the item 2 and a decrease of at least 50% on final HAM-D scores. </P>
<P>The second outcome was 'full remission', which is a more stringent criteria of improvement. It was defined as 'patients no longer meet DSM-III-R criteria for dysthymia and achieve a score of 0 on HAM-D item 1 - depressed mood' (such as <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>), and as 'symptom criteria no longer met plus absence of depressed mood and HAM-D endpoint 17-item score below 5) in <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>.</P>
<P>Dropouts were the third outcome used, and were extracted in 13 trials. <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK> gave the total number of dropouts for each group, but as for the other outcomes, there were 6 post-randomisation exclusions with no information about group distribution. </P>
<P>The number of patients reporting any adverse event was the fourth outcome. It was not possible to use other outcomes concerning side effects on account of different profiles for each drug group.</P>
<P>Reason for excluding studies: most of the excluded studies, particularly from the 1970s and 1980s, have failed on lack of definition of the illness, not specifying the duration of the depressive state or including patients suffering from brief depressive states or other conditions.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>) were classified as 'A' criteria according to the first quality assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1999</LINK>) because the authors provided further information in answer to our enquiry. The remaining trials did not provide information on allocation concealment and were classified as 'B'. </P>
<P>Data reporting and analysis: in general, the quality of reporting was poor. All trials reported the randomisation procedure without any information on allocation concealment. Some trials did not report the number of dropouts and post-randomisation exclusions. Most of the trials did not use an intention-to-treat approach, including data for 'completers' only. The omission of standard deviations was also common, as well as basic information about the studied population (setting, demographic data).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON 1 - TCAs VERSUS SSRIs</B>
<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>) compared SSRIs (134) against TCAs (136). This study used sertraline (50-200 mg daily), imipramine ( 50-200 mg daily) and placebo. Its purpose was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of dysthymia.</P>
<P>1. Non treatment response<BR/>This outcome was assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions improvement score of 1or 2 (very much or much improved). No significant difference was found (RR 1.14 95% CI 0.84 - 1.54).</P>
<P>2. Absence of full remission<BR/>The authors established a criterion for full remission which was: patients no longer meet DSM-III-R criteria for dysthymia and achieve a score of 0 on HAM-D item 1. A second remission criterion was a HAM-D cutoff score of 4 or less. This study also did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.80 - 1.29).</P>
<P>3. Number of dropouts<BR/>More patients in the imipramine group discontinued treatment, mainly because of more adverse events than in the sertraline group (RR 0.47 95% CI 0.20-0.75).</P>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON 2 - TCAs VERSUS MAOIs</B>
<BR/>Three studies compared TCAs (N= 141) against MAOIs ( N= 139), in which the drugs used were: imipramine, in the TCAs´group, phenelzine and moclobemide in the MAOIs´group. The drug protocol was flexible, accepting high doses. The outcomes "absence of full remission" and "number of people reporting adverse events" were described in one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>1. Non treatment response<BR/>Two studies assessed this outcome measured by the CGI rating scale. However, they used different drugs: <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1989</LINK> compared imipramine versus phenelzine and <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK> analysed imipramine against moclobemide. There was a discrepancy between them: whilst <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1989</LINK> presented a difference favouring imipramine, <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK> showed an advantage in the usage of moclobemide, but neither of the two results was statistically significant (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.0.45-2.31).</P>
<P>2. Absence of full remission<BR/>One single trial approached this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>), comparing moclobemide with imipramine, favouring the former ( RR 0.79 95% CI 0.62-1.01).</P>
<P>3. Number of dropouts<BR/>Two studies analysed this outcome: <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK> ( imipramine versus moclobemide) and <LINK REF="STD-Vallejo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vallejo 1987</LINK> ( imipramine versus phenelzine). No statistical differences were recorded in these trials.</P>
<P>4. Number of people reporting adverse events<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK> ( N= 211) reported this outcome, showing better results for MAOIs with a statistically significant difference (RR 0.84 95% CI 0.71-0.99). The main adverse events were: dry mouth, tremor, constipation, sweating, blurred vision, sleepiness, dizziness, headache, insomnia and nausea. </P>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON 3 - TCA VERSUS OTHER DRUGS</B>
<BR/>The TCAs used were: amitriptyline and imipramine, in medium doses. <LINK REF="STD-Guelfi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guelfi 1989</LINK> compared tianeptine (N=135) against amitriptyline (N=130). <LINK REF="STD-Salzmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzmann 1995</LINK> compared minaprine (N=33) with imipramine (N=34). <LINK REF="STD-Bakish-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bakish 1993</LINK> compared ritanserin (N=17) with imipramine (N=16), and the last one only contributed to the outcome 'number of dropouts'. </P>
<P>1.Non treatment response<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Guelfi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guelfi 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Salzmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzmann 1995</LINK> reported this outcome and neither of them showed a difference between the analysed drugs, although in the first one the results slightly favoured amitriptyline (RR 1.33 95% CI 0.95-1.86).</P>
<P>2. Number of dropouts<BR/>Three studies assessed this outcome and there was no significant difference in drop-out rates between the groups, despite a trend favouring ritanserin, amitriptyline and minaprine.</P>
<P>3. Number of people reporting adverse events<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Salzmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzmann 1995</LINK> reported this outcome. There was no significant difference in terms of numbers of adverse events in both treatment groups (RR 0.72 95% CI 0.44-1.17). </P>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON 4 - SSRIs VERSUS OTHER DRUGS</B>
<BR/>Two studies compared fluoxetine (N =20) versus trazodone (N=18), but only <LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK> analysed the outcome changes from baseline on 21-item HAM-D, given the fact that patients met criteria for both dysthymia and major depression. <LINK REF="STD-Otero-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Otero 1994</LINK> compared fluoxetine versus fluoxetine +bentazepan to analyse if fluoxetine could accelerate the onset of antidepressant effects. <LINK REF="STD-Smeraldi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smeraldi 1996</LINK> compared amisulpride at low doses (50 mg/day) versus fluoxetine (20mg/day). </P>
<P>1. Non treatment response<BR/>Three studies assessed this outcome, two of them comparing trazodone versus fluoxetine and one comparing amisulpiride versus fluoxetine. In the first group, results favoured trazodone (RR1.43 95% CI 0.81-2.51) whilst in the second one fluoxetine had an advantage over amisulpiride at low doses (RR 0.82 95% CI 0.57-1.20)</P>
<P>2. Changes from baseline on 21-item HAM-D<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK> reported this outcome showing a slightly advantage in the use of trazodone (WMD 2.75 95% CI -1.37-6.47).</P>
<P>3. Number of dropouts<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Otero-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Otero 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Smeraldi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smeraldi 1996</LINK> found a lower number of dropouts in the groups using fluoxetine compared to those receiving other drugs such as amisulpiride and bentazepan, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. <LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 1992</LINK> compared trazodone versus fluoxetine and found no significant difference favouring trazodone (RR 2.59 95% CI 0.44 - 15.32).</P>
<P>4. Number of people reporting adverse events<BR/>No statistical differences were recorded in the <LINK REF="STD-Otero-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Otero 1994</LINK> trial regarding data on the number of people reporting adverse events when fluoxetine alone was compared to fluoxetine with bentazepan (RR 0.94 95% CI 0.46 - 1.91). In <LINK REF="STD-Smeraldi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smeraldi 1996</LINK>, no difference was observed between amisulpiride and fluoxetine. </P>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON 5 - ADDITIONAL COMPARISONS BETWEEN ANTIDEPRESSANTS</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1992</LINK> compared 5-10 mg ritanserin (N=33) and 1-2 mg flupenthixol (N=37) for a period of 6 months, only contributing with the outcome ' number of dropouts' . Two studies compared amisulpiride at low doses (50 mg/daily) to viloxazine150mg/daily (<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1994</LINK>) and amineptine in doses of 200mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>1. Non treatment response<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Leon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1994</LINK> found a significant difference favouring amisulpiride over viloxazine (RR 0.45 CI 95% 0.25 - 0.83). No differences were found between amisulpiride and amineptine in <LINK REF="STD-Boyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 1996</LINK>'s trial (RR 0.95 CI 95% 0.73 - 1.25).<BR/> <BR/>2. Number of dropouts<BR/>None of the three trials that assessed this outcome demonstrated significant differences between any drugs.</P>
<P>3. Number of people reporting adverse events<BR/>A similar rate of subjects reporting adverse events was seen in both groups (amisulpiride and amineptine) in the only study (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 1996</LINK>) that evaluated this outcome (RR 0.88 CI 95% 0.70 - 1.11). <BR/> </P>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON 6 - ANY ANTIDEPRESSANTS VERSUS IMIPRAMINE</B>
<BR/>Five studies assessed imipramine against any other antidepressants (<LINK REF="STD-Salzmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vallejo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vallejo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>). The drugs used in these trials were: minaprine, phenelzine, sertraline, phenelzine and moclobemide. Only <LINK REF="STD-Vallejo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vallejo 1987</LINK> contributed to the outcome of ' dropouts'. </P>
<P>1. Non treatment response<BR/>Although a trend favouring moclobemide over imipramine was found in <LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>'s study, there were no statistical differences when all results concerning response to treatment were pooled (RR 0,95 95% CI 0,73-1,24). </P>
<P>2. Number of dropouts<BR/>A pooled estimate suggested that dropouts were more likely to occur amongst those taking imipramine (RR 0,60 95% CI 0,43-0,82). The best results were obtained when sertraline was compared to imipramine in the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Thase-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thase 1996</LINK>.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Results from our previous work on placebo controlled trials assessing the efficacy of antidepressants for dysthymia have shown that all studied drugs promote similar clinical responses, although with different side effect profiles. The evidence for TCAs and SSRIs is the most robust, considering the number of trials and participants. The conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made in consultation with patients, taking drug-specific side effect properties into consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Lima-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The one trial comparing SSRIs and TCAs found an effect very similar to trials in depression, that is, there is a similar treatment efficacy and SSRIs cause less dropouts. The difference here is much greater (RR 0.479, 95%CI 0.30-0.95; NNH 5.74, 95%CI 3.64-13.52) but is based on one study only.</P>
<P>The trial of phenelzine and moclobemide versus imipramine gives somewhat different results, but the difference is not statistically significant. It could be said that there is no advantage of phenelzine and little, therefore, to warrant its obvious disadvantages in terms of interactions. Moclobemide is an easier drug to prescribe and take, but again these results are based in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Versiani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Versiani 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, such non-significant advantage for moclobemide against TCAs is not seen in major depression trials (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>No relevant conclusions can be drawn from other comparisons, including trials where other drugs were compared to TCA or SSRIs. On the other hand, the high number of distinct comparisons and the fact that sometimes the reference drug could not be considered as a standard treatment (amisulpiride versus viloxazine, in <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1994</LINK>) makes it difficult to draw conclusions. It was not possible to use the funnel plot, therefore publication bias can not be discarded. </P>
<P>Current results must be analysed carefully given that replication in other trials would be necessary for a more robust conclusion. In addition, it is likely that some of the comparisons will not ever be compared in future investigations because of higher priority questions regarding the efficacy of treatments in dysthymia (see below).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>TCAs, SSRIs and MAOIs seem to be reasonable choices for those suffering from dysthymia, although SSRIs are probably the better choice because of their acceptability. This review provides no specific information on relevant matters such as how long the pharmacological treatment should be continued, at what dose, or at what threshold of severity of dysthymia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a clear need for larger and long-term studies of the comparative efficacy of drugs in dysthymia. As far the decision-making process for treating patients with dysthymia is concerned, It would be of particular interest in these future trials to use a standard set of comparative compounds (such as TCAs or SSRIs) and relevant outcomes like full remission both at short and long term, quality of life, and patient satisfaction.</P>
