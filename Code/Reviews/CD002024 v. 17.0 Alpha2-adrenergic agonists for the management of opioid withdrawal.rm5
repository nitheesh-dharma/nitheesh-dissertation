<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, and tizanidine) in managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (for example heroin, methadone).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a required first step for longer-term treatments of opioid dependence. The combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completion of opioid withdrawal difficult for most people. For many years, the main approach to detoxification involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose. The use of methadone in this way has been limited by government restrictions on prescription of methadone and dislike of the drawn-out nature of methadone withdrawal. Clonidine and similar medications (known as alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists) offer an alternative approach. This review considered whether alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists are more effective than reducing doses of methadone, and whether there are any differences in the effectiveness of different types of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to November 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 26 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 1728 opioid-dependent participants. The studies were undertaken in 12 different countries and involved treatment with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, and in one study, tizanidine) compared with reducing doses of methadone (12 studies), placebo (six studies), or symptomatic medications (four studies). Five studies compared different alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists. Treatment was scheduled to last for one to two weeks in most studies; the shortest duration was three days, and the longest was 30 days.</P>
<P>Six studies received some financial support from a pharmaceutical company.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Opioid withdrawal was similar with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone, but the duration of treatment was longer and there were fewer adverse effects with methadone. Withdrawal signs and symptoms occurred earlier with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists, within a few days of cessation of the opioid drugs. The chances of completing withdrawal treatment were similar.</P>
<P>Clonidine and lofexidine were more effective than placebo in managing withdrawal from heroin or methadone, and were associated with higher chances of completing treatment.</P>
<P>Lofexidine had less effect on blood pressure than clonidine.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>For alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, the evidence was very low to moderate quality, indicating that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect made in this review. However, the evidence is sufficient to indicate that alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo, making further comparisons of this nature inappropriate on ethical grounds.</P>
<P>For the comparison of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, the evidence was low to moderate quality. The key reasons for the low quality were small numbers of studies reporting some outcomes, low rates of occurrence of some events (for example drop-out due to adverse effects), and variability between studies.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-13 12:43:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 1728 participants. Six studies compared an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications, and five compared different alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists. We assessed 10 studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one of the methodological domains that were considered.</P>
<P>We found moderate-quality evidence that alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57; 3 studies; 148 participants). We found moderate-quality evidence that completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84; 3 studies; 148 participants).</P>
<P>Peak withdrawal severity may be greater with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists than with reducing doses of methadone, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73; 5 studies; 340 participants; low quality), and peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46; 2 studies; 263 participants; moderate quality), but these differences were not significant and there is no significant difference in severity when considered over the entire duration of the withdrawal episode (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49; 3 studies; 119 participants; moderate quality). The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83; 3 studies; 310 participants; low quality). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10; 6 studies; 464 participants; low quality), but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 9 studies; 659 participants; low quality).</P>
<P>There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-08 13:45:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. We detected no significant difference in efficacy between treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, but methadone was associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-08 14:20:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dependence on opioid drugs is a major health and social issue in most societies. Globally, it is estimated that around 0.2% of adults report unsanctioned use of opioid drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2015</LINK>). Despite this low prevalence of opioid use, unsanctioned use of opioid drugs contributes more to the burden of disease than other illicit psychoactive drugs. The burden to the individual user and the community of opioid dependence arises from premature mortality and disability associated with dependent use, with greatest impact in younger populations of drug users (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2015</LINK>), transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, healthcare costs, crime and law enforcement costs, as well as the less tangible costs of family disruption and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Mark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mark 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment is central to the reduction of the harms incurred by individuals and the community from opioid dependence. Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, by itself is not an effective treatment for dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). Rates of completion of withdrawal tend to be low, and rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high (<LINK REF="REF-Broers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaillant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaillant 1988</LINK>). However, withdrawal remains a required first step for many forms of longer-term treatment such as residential rehabilitation and naltrexone maintenance (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). It may also represent the endpoint of an extensive period of substitution treatment such as methadone maintenance. As such, the availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective and comprehensive treatment system.</P>
<P>The signs and symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome include irritability, anxiety, apprehension, muscular and abdominal pains, chills, nausea, diarrhoea, yawning, lacrimation, sweating, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, general weakness, and insomnia. Symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome usually begin two to three half-lives after the last opioid dose, that is six to 12 hours for short half-life opioids such as heroin and morphine, and 36 to 48 hours for long half-life opioids such as methadone. Following cessation of a short half-life opioid, symptoms reach peak intensity within two to four days, with most of the obvious physical withdrawal signs no longer observable after seven to 14 days. As with the onset of withdrawal, the duration also varies with the half-life of the opioid used, and the duration of regular use (<LINK REF="REF-Tetrault-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetrault 2009</LINK>). The opioid withdrawal syndrome is rarely life-threatening or associated with significant aberrations of mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>), but the combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completion of withdrawal difficult for most people (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tetrault-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetrault 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-08 14:20:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For many years, routine procedures involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). This approach derived from observations that the withdrawal syndrome from methadone was milder, though longer, than that from morphine. Methadone's high oral bioavailability, efficacy, and long duration of withdrawal relief (24 to 36 hours) were additional factors that have contributed to it being the main medication used in specialist withdrawal programmes since the 1980s.</P>
<P>Ambivalence to the use of a drug of dependence to treat opioid dependence, government restrictions on prescription of methadone, and consumer dislike of the protracted nature of methadone withdrawal have, to some extent, limited the use of methadone in this way (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>). Discovery of the capacity of the alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist clonidine to ameliorate some signs and symptoms of withdrawal led to widespread use of this drug as a non-opioid alternative for managing withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1988a</LINK>). One mechanism underlying opioid withdrawal is noradrenergic hyperactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1989</LINK>). The alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists act centrally to moderate the symptoms of noradrenergic hyperactivity.</P>
<P>The use of clonidine in the management of opioid withdrawal has been hampered by side effects of sedation and hypotension. This, in turn, has led to the investigation of the effectiveness of other alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists - most commonly lofexidine and guanfacine - in the management of opioid withdrawal, the aim being to find a drug that has clonidine's capacity to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, but with fewer side effects.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The focus of this review is the effectiveness of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) in the management of opioid withdrawal, relative to other forms of treatment, placebo, and each other.</P>
<P>A complex range of variables can potentially influence the course and subjective severity of withdrawal, including the type of opioid used, dose taken, concomitant use of other drugs including alcohol, duration of use, general physical health, and psychological factors, such as the reasons for undertaking withdrawal and fear of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1985</LINK>). Outcomes of a withdrawal episode may also be influenced by a prior period of substitution treatment, since such treatment is likely to result in a degree of stabilisation in health and social functioning that may facilitate successful withdrawal. Where information was available, we have considered the influence of these variables.</P>
<P>The first, or acute, phase of withdrawal is followed by a period of about six months of a secondary or protracted withdrawal syndrome. This protracted syndrome is characterised by a general feeling of reduced well-being, which is reflected in measurable abnormal physiological functioning. During this phase, strong cravings for opioids may be experienced periodically. The malaise associated with protracted abstinence is thought to be a major factor in relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Satel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satel 1993</LINK>). The protracted nature of withdrawal makes the period of recovery from dependence typically lengthy and influenced by a range of factors, both social and treatment related. The types of intervention offered following the acute phase of withdrawal to promote recovery and prevent relapse are substantially different to those offered in the management of withdrawal and may include psychological and lifestyle counselling, support groups, and pharmacological and medical treatment. We have excluded this long-term aspect of treatment of opioid dependence from this review because of its substantially different nature.</P>

<P>Experimental interventions involved the administration of an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, or tizanidine) as the principal medication to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</P>
<P>Comparison interventions involved the use of reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, placebo, or an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist regimen different to the experimental intervention. For the purpose of this review, symptomatic medications are defined as benzodiazepines, antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, antipsychotics, antispasmodics, muscle relaxants, or non-opioid analgesics, administered in combination as needed or according to a defined regimen.</P>
<P>We excluded studies of interventions using alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists in conjunction with opioid antagonists.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2016-04-12 02:32:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the included studies on the basis of a number of measures:</P>
<OL>
<LI>withdrawal syndrome (intensity, time course, predominant signs and symptoms);</LI>
<LI>duration of treatment;</LI>
<LI>nature and incidence of adverse effects; and</LI>
<LI>completion of treatment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Interventions aimed at the management of acute opioid withdrawal are typically of short duration. As a result, structured psychological therapies are generally not provided as adjuncts to interventions for managing withdrawal, but the episode of withdrawal management does provide the opportunity to inform people who are opioid dependent about the options for further treatment, and to encourage them to engage in treatment appropriate to their needs. The longer the duration of treatment, the more opportunities there are for interaction between treatment services and people who are opioid dependent. The relative time in treatment is also an indicator of the relative acceptability to participants of the interventions being compared. For these reasons, we considered duration of treatment in addition to rates of completion of treatment.</P>
<P>It is difficult to differentiate side effects of treatment from the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. We have defined adverse effects as clinically significant signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (such as vomiting and diarrhoea) plus any incidents that are not typical components of the opioid withdrawal syndrome. Early experience with clonidine, which was developed as a hypotensive agent, was that low blood pressure is a common adverse effect of clonidine treatment. This review therefore considered the occurrence of hypotension or symptoms of hypotension, withholding doses of medication, and cessation of treatment because of adverse effects.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the approach recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This was based on the evaluation of seven specific methodological domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and providers, blinding of outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues). For each study, we analysed the six domains, described them as reported in the study, and provided a final judgement on the likelihood of bias in terms of low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We based these judgements on the criteria indicated in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and their applicability to the addiction field.</P>
<P>We considered blinding separately for subjective and objective outcomes. Lack of blinding is a source of serious risk of bias for subjective outcomes, but is less significant with objective outcomes, such as completion of treatment and duration of treatment. We only considered incomplete outcome data for intensity of withdrawal and nature and incidence of adverse effects. Retention in treatment (duration of treatment) and completion of treatment are frequently used primary outcome measures in addiction research. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for detailed description.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2001. The review was substantially updated in 2014 to incorporate a flow diagram of the search process, and with a modified search strategy. In the 2014 edition of this review, through the modified search strategy, we identified 2472 records after removing duplicates; we excluded 1969 records on first screening, and screened 503 records in more detail. Of these, 229 were excluded and the full text for 274 was obtained for more detailed assessment; 198 were excluded without listing, 42 records (32 studies) were excluded with reasons, and 34 records (25 studies) satisfied all the criteria to be included in the review.</P>
<P>In the present update, we again modified the search strategy, adding Web of Science as one of the databases searched. We also removed the term 'Metabolic Detoxication, Drug' from the MEDLINE and CENTRAL searches, as this now maps to 'metabolic inactivation', which is not relevant to this review. In this update, we identified 3377 records after removing duplicates (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), of which 2764 were excluded on first screening and 613 were screened in more detail, with a further 282 being excluded on the basis of title and abstract.

</OL>
<P>One study compared clonidine and guanfacine with methadone (<LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>). In this review, we combined the clonidine and guanfacine groups for comparison with methadone to avoid double-counting of participants.</P>
<P>In two studies that compared an adrenergic agonist with symptomatic medications, details of the symptomatic medications used were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sos 2000</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Bertschy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bertschy 1997</LINK>, the symptomatic medication regimen was based on carbamazepine plus mianserin, and in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1988</LINK>, it was based on chlordiazepoxide plus chlorpromazine.</P>
<P>Five studies included comparison regimens that were not defined by the inclusion criteria for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> included groups treated with regimens based on opioid antagonists; this approach is covered by a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK> included a group treated with buprenorphine, which is also the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK> included a group treated with Qigong, a traditional Chinese health practice. <LINK REF="STD-Nazari-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nazari 2013</LINK> included a group treated with Hab-o Shefa, a traditional Iranian medicine comprised of a combination of plant extracts.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment setting</HEADING>
<P>In 16 of the 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, treatment was provided on an inpatient basis. In one study, treatment occurred in the health centre of a prison (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2002</LINK>); in another study, participants were residents in a mandatory drug treatment centre (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>); seven studies had an outpatient setting. In <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>, the duration of each treatment session effectively resulted in participants receiving day-care during withdrawal. A similar approach was used for the clonidine group in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>, but it is unclear whether the comparison methadone group received a similar amount of clinic time. In <LINK REF="STD-Carnwath-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carnwath 1998</LINK>, withdrawal was home based with participants scheduled to receive four visits in the first week and three in the second (with the number of additional visits requested being one of the outcome indicators for the study).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>In 19 of the 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, all participants were withdrawing from heroin or other short-acting opioids, while participants in five studies were either withdrawing from methadone, or were stabilised on methadone prior to, or as the first stage of, the withdrawal treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Howells-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2002</LINK>, participants were withdrawing from either heroin or methadone, and in <LINK REF="STD-Nazari-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nazari 2013</LINK> the majority of participants reported using opium.</P>
<P>Participants in three studies were notable for low levels of injecting use: all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1988</LINK> used via the inhalation route; in <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK>, 67% of participants treated with clonidine only used orally, 2% only used intravenously, while the remainder used both orally and intravenously; and in <LINK REF="STD-Nazari-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nazari 2013</LINK>, injecting use was reported by 20% of participants.</P>
<P>For participants withdrawing from methadone, doses of methadone at the commencement of treatment with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist were 40 mg per day or less for four of the studies, and were not reported for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 1997</LINK>). Only one study specified that all participants were withdrawing following a period of methadone maintenance treatment, with all participants stable on a dose of 20 mg per day at the commencement of withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Opioid use was more common among men than women. Consistent with this, between two-thirds and three-quarters of participants in most of the 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria were men, while in five studies, all participants were men (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nazari-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nazari 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty of the 26 studies reported the average age of participants. In 19 studies the average age was between 23 and 32 years. The average age of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK> was 39.7 years, reflecting the recruitment of people admitted to hospital for the treatment of an acute acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related condition.

<P>The countries were diverse: the USA (five studies); Spain (five studies); the UK (four studies); Italy (three studies); China (two studies); and one study in each of Australia, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, Germany, Hungary, and Iran. The cultural context of opioid use in India, China, and Taiwan could be a source of variability for those studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1997</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK>, only some of the participants entered treatment voluntarily; the majority were admitted for withdrawal under programmes of "mobilised rehabilitation".

In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruno-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bruno 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK>), the period reported was less than one week. In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nazari-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nazari 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-San-1994" TYPE="STUDY">San 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Washton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Washton 1981</LINK>), the scheduled duration was greater than two weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1988</LINK>, the scheduled duration was unclear.</P>
<P>Most studies did not specify the route of administration of the alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists, but oral administration is most likely, except in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>. These two studies included antagonist-induced withdrawal as comparison modalities. Participants allocated to treatment with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists or opioid antagonist regimens received four hours of intravenous therapy in the morning and three hours in the afternoon, with participants in the clonidine-only groups receiving clonidine 0.15 mg in saline three or six times a day. Clonidine has high oral bioavailability, and hence these intravenous doses are approximately equivalent to oral doses. It is unclear whether this approach was common practice in the hospital concerned, or if it was specifically selected to suit the antagonist-based treatment regimens in the studies.</P>
<P>For the studies that used clonidine orally, the maximum dose ranged from 0.9 mg per day to 1.35 mg per day. In most studies, clonidine was administered as three or four divided doses.</P>
<P>For the studies that used lofexidine, maximum doses ranged from 1.6 mg per day to 2.0 mg per day. In most studies, lofexidine was administered as two or three divided doses, but <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1997</LINK> administered four doses per day.</P>
<P>In summary, alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists are typically administered orally as two to four doses per day, with the total dose adjusted daily according to withdrawal symptoms and side effects (particularly blood pressure). Clonidine is generally commenced at 0.1 mg per dose to 0.2 mg per dose, increasing to a maximum of around 1.0 mg per day, and lofexidine at 0.4 mg per dose to 0.6 mg per dose, increasing to a maximum of around 2 mg per day. Maximal doses are generally administered for only a few days around the time of maximal withdrawal, usually two to four days after cessation of opioids. Doses are then tapered, and ceased seven to 10 days after cessation of opioids. (There was insufficient information to determine typical doses of guanfacine or tizanidine, which were the only other alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists used in the included studies.)</P>

<P>Each of these sections is subdivided into parts addressing the types of outcome measures identified as being of interest: (a) withdrawal syndrome, (b) duration of treatment, (c) nature and incidence of adverse effects, and (d) completion of treatment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Withdrawal syndrome</HEADING>
<P>Two studies involving 113 participants reported a peak withdrawal score (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Both studies indicate less severe withdrawal with adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, but due to the extreme degree of heterogeneity between the studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 98%), an estimate of combined effect was not calculated. Some of the heterogeneity may have been due to the method of assessing withdrawal severity. In <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2008</LINK>, withdrawal was assessed as significantly more severe in the placebo group when measured by the modified Himmelsbach and Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scales, but not the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale. (The data in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> is based on the modified Himmelsbach scores.)</P>
<P>Three studies involving 148 participants reported the number of participants with severe withdrawal (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), with this outcome significantly less likely with adrenergic agonist treatment compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57; 3 studies; 148 participants). The difference remained significant when the study with a high risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-Batey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1987</LINK>, was excluded (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.83; 117 participants).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Benos-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Benos 1985</LINK> reported that withdrawal scores were significantly lower in participants treated with clonidine compared with participants given placebo, from the time of the second dose on the first day of treatment. The significant difference was seen with both observer and participant ratings of withdrawal. On exit from treatment, 87.5% of participants in the clonidine group, compared with 20.8% in the placebo group, rated the efficacy of treatment as "good". In <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2008</LINK>, 15 of 33 (45%) in the placebo group, compared with 6 of 35 (17%) in the lofexidine group, discontinued treatment because the study medication was "not working", suggesting less effective control of withdrawal in the placebo group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Duration of treatment</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies reported the average time in treatment, but <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2008</LINK> both reported that more participants receiving placebo dropped out early in treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 1995</LINK>, 2 of 33 (6%) participants treated with clonidine, compared with 5 of 19 (26%) participants receiving placebo, dropped out of treatment in the first week. In <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2008</LINK>, there were significantly fewer early terminations in the lofexidine group: on day six (the third day of study treatment), 20 of 34 (59%) participants treated with lofexidine remained in treatment, compared with 8 of 33 (24%) participants receiving placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(c) Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Benos-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Benos 1985</LINK> reported sedation and dry mouth to be approximately twice as common in participants treated with clonidine, compared with participants who received placebo. However, these adverse effects were rated as causing difficulty in only a small number of cases and were not considered a problem.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Batey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1987</LINK>, 7 of 16 participants treated with clonidine, compared with none of 15 participants receiving placebo, experienced drowsiness and dizziness. Participants in both groups frequently complained of dry mouth. None withdrew from treatment as a result of adverse effects.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2008</LINK>, blood pressure was significantly decreased in the lofexidine group on days four to seven of treatment. Asthenia, dizziness, hypotension (18% versus 0%) and insomnia (42% versus 9%) all occurred more frequently in the lofexidine group. Four of 35 participants in the lofexidine group, compared with none of 33 participants in the placebo group, terminated treatment due to adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nazari-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nazari 2013</LINK> reported the average overall side effects score, with no significant differences between groups.</P>
<P>The other studies did not report any information about adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(d) Completion of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Based on three studies, completion of withdrawal treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) was significantly more likely with an adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine) compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84; 3 studies; 148 participants). The difference remained significant when the study with a high risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-Batey-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1987</LINK>, was excluded (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.19; 117 participants).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Withdrawal syndrome</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intensity of withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported data on peak withdrawal severity (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). These data suggest somewhat lower severity with methadone (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46; 2 studies; 263 participants), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07).</P>
<P>Five studies reported the rate of occurrence of severe withdrawal (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), which was defined by participants giving "intolerable withdrawal" as the reason for leaving treatment, or a score greater than five on the Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK>). Severe withdrawal was somewhat more likely to occur in participants treated with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73; 5 studies; 340 participants), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.39). Note that <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> compared clonidine, methadone, and guanfacine. In this analysis, we combined the clonidine and guanfacine groups to enable entry of both groups without double-counting of the participants in the methadone group. Excluding the two studies at high risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK>, from this analysis made little difference to the result (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.13; 109 participants).</P>
<P>Three studies reported data on overall withdrawal severity (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). These data indicate no significant difference between alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and tapered methadone (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49; 3 studies; 119 participants).</P>
<P>In addition to the quantitative data, <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 1996</LINK> reported overall withdrawal to be more severe on days three to seven and day 10 for the group receiving lofexidine, with both groups experiencing a similar gradual decline in symptoms over the next 14 days, and in <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> withdrawal was assessed as more severe with methadone.</P>
<P>Taken together, these data suggest that peak withdrawal severity may be greater with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists, but there is no significant difference in severity when considered over the entire duration of the withdrawal episode.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Time course of withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies provided information on the time course of development and resolution of withdrawal signs and symptoms. This information was provided in terms of the time of drop-out for participants giving unacceptable withdrawal as the reason, graphs of daily withdrawal scores and time of maximal withdrawal. In all studies, the signs and symptoms of withdrawal appeared earlier in withdrawal managed with an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist and resolved more quickly. In general, when withdrawal is managed with tapered methadone, peak withdrawal occurs at the end of the taper (<LINK REF="STD-Bearn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Washton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Washton 1981</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Predominant signs and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK> reported higher levels of appetite loss, low energy, muscle pains, drowsiness, yawning, dry mouth, and sneezing among participants treated with clonidine compared with reducing doses of methadone. However, <LINK REF="STD-Washton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Washton 1981</LINK>, using the same treatment regimen, reported that major symptomatic complaints (specifically lethargy, restlessness, and insomnia) were identical for both groups, and subjective ratings were indistinguishable. <LINK REF="STD-Cami-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cami 1985</LINK> reported sleep disturbances and "weeping" were more common in participants treated with clonidine, while muscular aching, flatulence, and drowsiness were more common in participants treated with methadone (tapered from 30 mg per day to 45 mg per day over 10 days). <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> reported sleeplessness, restlessness, muscular pain, and insomnia as the most frequent signs and symptoms in participants treated with methadone. In comparison, the most frequent signs and symptoms in the clonidine and guanfacine groups were mydriasis and sleeplessness, followed by chills, muscular pain, and insomnia in the clonidine group, or muscular pain and restlessness in the guanfacine group. <LINK REF="STD-Howells-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2002</LINK> reported scores for feeling cold and aches/pains were higher for participants treated with lofexidine, whereas scores for drowsiness were higher for participants treated with methadone. However, the main items contributing to scores in both groups were sleep problems, anxiety/nervousness, irritability, lack of energy, aches/pains, and feeling cold. <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> reported that observers noted only insomnia and slight anxiety in the group treated with clonidine, whereas they noted participants treated with methadone as experiencing anxiety, tachycardia, insomnia, rhinorrhoea, mydriasis, aching muscles, and irritability.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Duration of treatment</HEADING>
<P>The mean days in treatment was reported or was able to be calculated for three studies (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). The mean duration of treatment was significantly longer for the group treated with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83; 3 studies; 310 participants). The difference remained significant when we excluded the study with a high risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK> (SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.64; 110 participants).</P>
<P>Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 1996</LINK> who were treated with reducing doses of methadone remained in treatment for a mean 39.8 days, compared with 32 days for participants treated with lofexidine (P = 0.074). The time in treatment for this study extended beyond the period of acute withdrawal management, reducing the comparability with other studies, and since standard deviations were not reported, we were unable to include this study in the analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>, there was no difference in overall mean duration of treatment, but a difference became apparent for participants identified as treatment "failures" (in treatment for less than 12 days). While the mean duration was similar for "successes" in each group (14.7 days for clonidine, 14.7 days for guanfacine, and 14.2 days for methadone), the mean duration for "failures" was greater in the group treated with reducing doses of methadone (5.7 days for clonidine, 4.9 days for guanfacine, and 7.3 days for methadone).</P>
<P>The other seven studies included in this comparison did not report data on average time in treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(c) Nature and incidence of adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Six studies reported data on the incidence of hypotensive or other adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). Data for the clonidine and guanfacine groups in <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> were combined prior to entry. Overall, significantly more participants treated with an adrenergic agonist experienced adverse effects, compared with participants treated with reducing doses of methadone (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10; 6 studies; 464 participants). The strength of this finding is reduced by the low incidence of adverse effects and by the high risk of performance or attrition bias in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cami-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cami 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK>). When we excluded these three studies from the analysis, the estimated effect size remained much the same, but the difference was no longer statistically significant (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.64; 203 participants).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK> reported 89 out of 100 participants treated with clonidine experienced dizziness on standing, mostly in the second and third days of treatment when clonidine doses were at their highest (around 1 mg per day). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in the clonidine group (by no more than 10 mmHg) during the first four days of treatment, whereas blood pressure was stable in the methadone group. <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> reported significantly lower mean blood pressure in participants treated with clonidine, compared with participants treated with methadone, on treatment days two, three, four, six, seven, and eight. Mean blood pressure in participants treated with guanfacine was also significantly lower compared with the methadone group on treatment days three, six, seven, and nine.</P>
<P>In a comparison between lofexidine and reducing doses of methadone, <LINK REF="STD-Bearn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 1996</LINK> reported no significant difference in mean blood pressures. <LINK REF="STD-Howells-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2002</LINK> also compared lofexidine with reducing doses of methadone; in this study, there was no appreciable change in either heart rate or blood pressure, and there was no significant difference in mean blood pressures for the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-San-1994" TYPE="STUDY">San 1994</LINK> reported a greater decrease in blood pressure for the group treated with guanfacine 4 mg per day, compared with groups treated with guanfacine 3 mg per day or reducing doses of methadone. In addition, a bradycardic effect was seen in the guanfacine 4 mg per day group from day nine (the day on which guanfacine was substituted for methadone), whereas there was no difference in heart rate for the guanfacine 3 mg per day or methadone groups.</P>
<P>Four studies reported data on the number of participants who dropped out of treatment due to adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). While the risk of drop-out due to adverse effects was somewhat higher for participants treated with an adrenergic agonist (clonidine for all four studies that reported data), the difference was not statistically significant (RR 3.62, 95% CI 0.77 to 16.94; 4 studies; 153 participants). The accuracy of this comparison is reduced by the small number of events and the absence of drop-out due to adverse effects from the groups receiving methadone. Excluding the study at high risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK>, made little difference to the result (RR 4.48, 95% CI 0.76 to 26.34; 105 participants).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(d) Completion of treatment</HEADING>
<P>We excluded data from three studies from the analysis of completion rates. In <LINK REF="STD-Howells-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2002</LINK>, completion was influenced by procedural issues related to the prison setting (participants did not return from court or were transferred to another prison) and not just medication. The majority of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK> entered treatment under programmes of "mobilised rehabilitation" (that is treatment was not voluntary). In this context, rates of completion of withdrawal are not meaningful. In <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK>, completion was influenced by the clinical status of the acute (AIDS-related) condition that was the reason for hospital admission.</P>
<P>Four studies used naloxone challenge tests or urine screening to confirm the completion of withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vilalta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vilalta 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Washton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Washton 1981</LINK>). Three studies defined success as completion of the scheduled treatment programme (<LINK REF="STD-Bearn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bearn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cami-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cami 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-San-1994" TYPE="STUDY">San 1994</LINK> reported the proportion of participants still in treatment on day 18 (when all treatment regimens were scheduled to have been completed), and <LINK REF="STD-Gerra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerra 2000</LINK> reported the numbers of participants who accepted naltrexone treatment. These varying data have been taken as the number completing treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data for the two guanfacine groups in <LINK REF="STD-San-1994" TYPE="STUDY">San 1994</LINK> and the clonidine and guanfacine groups in <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> were combined prior to entry. The analysis in <LINK REF="STD-Cami-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cami 1985</LINK> was based on 30 out of 45 participants entering the study who completed treatment, 15 with clonidine and 15 with methadone. Twelve participants dropped out of treatment, eight from the clonidine group and four from the methadone group, and three participants were stated to have completed treatment after transfer from clonidine to methadone. In line with principles of intention-to-treat analysis, we have included these three in the clonidine group, but did not count them as having completed withdrawal.</P>
<P>Overall, the combined result (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>) indicates no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal for alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with reducing doses of methadone (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 9 studies; 659 participants). We assessed one of the studies included in this analysis as having a high risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>). When we excluded this study from the analysis, the combined result was similar (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 489 participants).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effect of opioid used</HEADING>
<P>Participants in four of the nine studies that reported data on completion of withdrawal treatment were withdrawing from heroin, while participants in the other five studies were withdrawing from methadone (or were stabilised on methadone for a period prior to withdrawal). The relative rates of completion of withdrawal were similar for the two subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>): for participants withdrawing from heroin the RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; 4 studies; 293 participants) and for participants withdrawing from methadone the RR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.18; 5 studies; 364 participants). The study assessed as having a high risk of bias relevant to this outcome involved participants withdrawing from heroin (<LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>). Excluding this study from the analysis made little difference to the estimated effect (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.45; 123 participants).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effect of treatment setting</HEADING>
<P>In five studies, withdrawal occurred in an inpatient setting, while the other four studies used an outpatient setting. The outcome was similar for the two subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>): for inpatient settings the RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.12; 5 studies; 467 participants; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%) and for outpatient settings the RR was 1.09 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.64; 4 studies; 190 participants; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Excluding the study assessed as having a high risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK>, brought the group outcomes even closer together (inpatient: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18; 297 participants; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%; outpatient: RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.64; 190 participants). This suggests that the effectiveness of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists relative to methadone is not influenced by the withdrawal setting, but the strength of this conclusion is reduced by significant heterogeneity in the inpatient data, and low precision of the data for the studies undertaken in outpatient settings.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Carnwath-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carnwath 1998</LINK> reported no significant difference in any parameters for withdrawal managed with lofexidine compared with clonidine. A graph of mean daily symptom scores reported by <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 1997</LINK> for groups treated with clonidine or lofexidine showed an almost identical pattern of peak withdrawal on day seven (after cessation of methadone on day four), a plateau for three days, then a gradual reduction in the withdrawal score. No participants in either group experienced severe withdrawal, and no significant differences were detected. <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1997</LINK> also recorded almost identical patterns of withdrawal score for participants treated with lofexidine and participants treated with clonidine.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 1997</LINK> reported almost identical use of lorazepam as adjunct medication by participants in the lofexidine and clonidine groups: 10 of 14 in each group used lorazepam on 72 (clonidine) and 71 (lofexidine) occasions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 1997</LINK> stated the pattern of individual signs and symptoms of withdrawal to be similar with clonidine or lofexidine treatment, with bone pain and insomnia not responding to either drug. <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1997</LINK> also reported no difference between groups treated with clonidine or lofexidine in terms of predominant signs and symptoms of withdrawal.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> reported no significant difference between clonidine and guanfacine in the time course of withdrawal, and found that mydriasis, sleeplessness, and muscular pain were common symptoms in both groups. <LINK REF="STD-Muga-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Muga 1990</LINK> reported that scores for restlessness were significantly higher with clonidine, but there were no significant differences in any other items assessed.<BR/>

<P>We have reported the discussion in four sections according to the nature of comparison: (1) alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, (2) alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with reducing doses of methadone, (3) lofexidine and other alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with clonidine; and (4) other comparisons. Within each section, there is a brief summary of the findings from the Results, with comments and any additional relevant information from studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>The final section of the discussion considers factors potentially influencing outcomes, specifically the nature of opioids used and the setting in which withdrawal occurs.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo</HEADING>
<P>Clonidine and lofexidine appear to be associated with more adverse effects than placebo when used to manage opioid withdrawal, but despite this, they are clearly more effective in ameliorating withdrawal and more acceptable to participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with reducing doses of methadone</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Withdrawal syndrome experienced</HEADING>
<P>The studies considering this comparison reported data on the severity of withdrawal in different ways. As a result, the quantitative analyses of withdrawal severity are not robust. However, the data point towards withdrawal associated with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist treatment being similar to, or somewhat more intense than, withdrawal associated with a regimen of reducing doses of methadone. In all studies, the signs and symptoms of withdrawal appeared earlier in withdrawal managed with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and resolved more quickly. As a result, overall withdrawal severity was similar for the two approaches. The conclusion of a similar magnitude of withdrawal is supported by participant assessment of withdrawal tolerability and use of adjunct medication as well as comparative withdrawal score, suggesting that this is a reasonably robust conclusion.</P>
<P>There was considerable variability between studies in the signs and symptoms of withdrawal reported as being predominant during treatment. This prevents us from drawing any conclusions on relative effectiveness of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone in terms of the nature of residual signs and symptoms. However, it does appear that neither treatment suppresses fully the aches and pains, sleep disturbances, loss of energy, chills, or anxiety associated with opioid withdrawal. This indicates the need to use concomitant symptomatic medications to ameliorate residual symptoms of withdrawal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Duration of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Interpretation of data on duration of treatment is limited by the small number of studies providing these data and is confounded by a number of factors. One factor is differences in the scheduled duration of administration of active medications being compared, as occurred in <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK>. In these studies (components of a multicentre trial), participants allocated to methadone treatment had their methadone dose reduced from 20 mg per day to 0 mg per day over 20 days, then received placebo for 10 days before the outcome was assessed by a naloxone challenge on day 30. In comparison, participants in the clonidine groups received active medication for 10 days, then placebo for 20 days, with the aim of maintaining the double-blind conditions. The substantial difference in time without administration of active medication is likely to bias results in favour of the methadone group. We have attempted to allow for this to some extent by comparing the proportion of participants retained in treatment to the end of the period of scheduled administration of active medication as well as the actual duration of treatment.</P>
<P>We conclude from the available data that when opioid withdrawal is managed with methadone, the duration of treatment is longer than when withdrawal is managed with clonidine.</P>
<P>Retention in treatment is a significant outcome with all forms of treatment for drug dependence. In methadone maintenance and residential drug-free treatment, longer periods in treatment provide greater opportunity for delivery of psychosocial support, which might increase the likelihood of a successful outcome from either the current or future treatment episodes. Given the short-term nature of detoxification and the physical stress of withdrawal, there is less opportunity during managed withdrawal for meaningful psychosocial support to be provided. Considering the high rates of relapse following detoxification, no matter how withdrawal is managed, engagement in follow-up treatment is of greater clinical significance than the duration of the withdrawal episode.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(c) Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Overall, management of withdrawal with clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than management by reducing doses of methadone. Adverse effects are most severe in the initial few days of peak withdrawal when maximal doses of clonidine are administered. Aside from hypotension, the adverse effects more commonly associated with clonidine than with reducing doses of methadone were drowsiness, fatigue, lethargy, and dry mouth. Clinically, hypotension is the most significant adverse effect. Dizziness, probably due to hypotension, occurred much more frequently in the studies than did cessation of treatment because of adverse effects. This suggests that hypotension can be adequately managed by withholding doses and reducing the dose of medication according to blood pressure changes. Hypotension can also be avoided by withholding doses of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists until withdrawal is manifested by a rise in blood pressure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(d) Completion of withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>The data indicate that the greater duration of treatment seen with reducing doses of methadone is not translated into a similar increase in rates of completion of withdrawal. Rather, the data indicate that there is no significant difference in completion rates for withdrawal managed with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists compared with reducing doses of methadone. The finding of no significant difference applies for all alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and is maintained when studies with high risk of bias are excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Comparison of clonidine with lofexidine and guanfacine</HEADING>
<P>Clonidine and lofexidine are the only alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists for which there are sufficient studies to form a view on their relative effectiveness, and so this comparison is the focus of this section. However, there are some data comparing clonidine and guanfacine. <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> found no significant difference in withdrawal severity associated with clonidine compared with guanfacine treatment. Apart from a higher degree of restlessness among participants treated with clonidine, <LINK REF="STD-Muga-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Muga 1990</LINK> also found no differences in the withdrawal syndromes associated with guanfacine or clonidine treatment. The findings of <LINK REF="STD-San-1990" TYPE="STUDY">San 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-San-1994" TYPE="STUDY">San 1994</LINK> suggest that guanfacine may be associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, but the influence of dose level remains uncertain.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Withdrawal syndrome experienced</HEADING>
<P>Limited data are available from studies directly comparing clonidine and lofexidine. However, the data that are available point towards these drugs having similar effectiveness in terms of overall intensity of withdrawal and the patterns of individual signs and symptoms. Separate comparisons of clonidine or lofexidine with reducing doses of methadone also point towards the drugs having similar efficacy.</P>

<P>Hypotension occurs less frequently with lofexidine compared with clonidine treatment.

The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Carnwath-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carnwath 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 1997</LINK> indicate greater incidence of adverse effects with clonidine compared with lofexidine, with the greater hypotensive effect of clonidine contributing to the difference. The studies comparing lofexidine and reducing doses of methadone focused on blood pressure changes. Consequently, information on overall adverse effects of lofexidine and reducing doses of methadone is lacking.</P>
<P>Some additional information on adverse effects associated with lofexidine was provided by <LINK REF="REF-Akhurst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akhurst 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 1999</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Akhurst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akhurst 1999</LINK> (undertaken by the Britannia Pharmaceuticals) collected data retrospectively on 1074 detoxifications through a survey of treatment providers. Of the 1074 withdrawal episodes managed with lofexidine, 1.4% were ceased because of side effects. This was despite 8.5% experiencing dizziness, 7.5% hypotension, and 5.3% dry mouth. <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1989</LINK> was a retrospective study of 214 detoxifications using lofexidine in an inpatient setting. This study identified 144 instances of hypotension, with 23 (16%) of these instances resulting in the dose of lofexidine being withheld or reduced. Similar post-marketing survey data were not available for clonidine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(d) Completion of withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient data were available to form a view as to the relative effectiveness of clonidine and lofexidine in terms of rates of completion of withdrawal. However, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Carnwath-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carnwath 1998</LINK> suggest that the use of lofexidine may be associated with higher completion rates than clonidine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Other comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Consideration of the capacity of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of withdrawal relative to other medications was limited by small numbers of studies and limitations of study design. Clonidine appears to be more effective than symptomatic medications in terms of achieving suppression of withdrawal signs and symptoms without adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Factors potentially influencing outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The subgroup analysis of completion of withdrawal treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>) suggests that the nature of opioid used prior to withdrawal is not a significant factor influencing the effectiveness of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists relative to methadone. However, it should be noted that only <LINK REF="STD-Kleber-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kleber 1985</LINK> selected participants from methadone maintenance treatment. In other studies involving withdrawal from methadone, participants were stabilised on methadone for a short period prior to withdrawal. Hence, the possibility remains that completion of withdrawal may be influenced by the duration of methadone treatment prior to detoxification.</P>
<P>There is currently a trend of increasing use of pharmaceutical opioid preparations for non-medical purposes (<LINK REF="REF-World-Drug-Report-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Drug Report 2013</LINK>). Not only does this introduce diversity in the pharmacological properties of opioid drugs, but increasing use of pharmaceutical preparations may be associated with changes in the characteristics of users and patterns of use that have historically been associated with heroin. There is currently insufficient evidence available to determine the effect (if any) of the type of opioid, dose, route, and duration of use on withdrawal outcomes.</P>
<P>The second subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>) found no difference between alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone in rates of completion of withdrawal for treatment undertaken in inpatient or outpatient settings, but the strength of the finding is reduced by significant heterogeneity and low precision. One Cochrane review found only one study that directly compared inpatient and other settings for detoxification from opioid dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2005</LINK>). The authors of that review have subsequently undertaken a trial comparing inpatient and outpatient withdrawal from methadone managed with lofexidine, with no significant difference between settings other than in the duration of medication (<LINK REF="STD-Day-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2011</LINK>). The lack of evidence leaves the impact of setting a question to be answered.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-08 14:16:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the comparison of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, we rated the quality of the evidence as low to moderate (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), meaning that further evidence is likely to result in some changes to the estimates of effect. The robustness of the quantitative analyses was reduced by the risk of bias in the studies included in this comparison, the small number of studies reporting some outcomes, significant heterogeneity between studies, and the small number of events that were reported for some outcomes.</P>
<P>For the comparison of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists with placebo, we rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), meaning that further evidence would be very likely to result in changes to the estimates of effect, particularly the peak withdrawal score. However, the evidence is sufficient to indicate that alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo, making further comparisons of this nature inappropriate on ethical grounds. Comparisons with other active medications (methadone, buprenorphine, symptomatic medications) would be more appropriate.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-04-08 14:16:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was limited by small numbers of studies, small numbers of participants, and diversity in the interventions compared as well as the methods of assessing outcomes in the included studies. This reduced the capacity to assess with confidence the impact of methodological quality of the included studies and the possibility of publication bias.</P>
<P>The limitations were particularly marked in relation to assessing severity of withdrawal and the clinical significance of adverse effects. Differing approaches to assessing and reporting withdrawal signs and symptoms made it difficult to quantify accurately the effect of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists on withdrawal severity. Data on the occurrence of hypotensive and other adverse effects were of moderate quality, but the very low incidence of reported drop-out from treatment due to adverse effects reduced the strength of conclusions regarding the clinical significance of these adverse effects.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the requirements of clinical trials, particularly the need to maintain double-blind conditions, can limit the flexibility of dose regimens. The loss of flexibility is a potential source of bias, particularly for comparisons of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone. In clinical practice, flexible dosing with methadone for the purposes of detoxification would usually involve adjusting the rate of taper according to the person's withdrawal symptoms, craving, and general stability. Such flexibility is not provided in the clinical trials included in this review. Flexible dosing with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists usually involved withholding doses in response to lowered blood pressure; this is undertaken in both trial and clinical practice settings. The difference in capacity for flexibility would be expected to result in a negative bias against reducing doses of methadone.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When used in the management of opioid withdrawal, alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists are typically administered orally, in three or four doses per day, to a maximum of around 1.2 mg per day for clonidine and around 2 mg per day for lofexidine.</P>
<P>Compared to placebo, clonidine and lofexidine are associated with less severe withdrawal, longer time in treatment, and significantly higher rates of completion of treatment.</P>
<P>In comparison with reducing doses of methadone, the overall intensity of withdrawal associated with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist treatment appears similar to, or perhaps marginally greater than, that that associated with reducing doses of methadone. Withdrawal occurs at different stages of the treatment regimens. With alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist treatment, the signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur earlier, within a few days of cessation of opioid drugs, whereas with reducing doses of methadone, the signs and symptoms of withdrawal do not become apparent until methadone doses approach zero. The signs and symptoms of withdrawal also resolve at an earlier stage when withdrawal is managed with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists.</P>
<P>Management of withdrawal with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists, compared with reducing doses of methadone, is associated with shorter duration of treatment but similar rates of completion of withdrawal.</P>
<P>Data are limited, but it appears that clonidine and lofexidine have similar capacity to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Lofexidine treatment is probably associated with rates of completion of withdrawal that are similar to rates associated with clonidine withdrawal.</P>
<P>Management of withdrawal with clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than management by reducing doses of methadone. Adverse effects were most severe during the few days of peak withdrawal when maximal doses of clonidine are administered. Hypotensive events associated with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic treatment occurred much more frequently in the studies than did cessation of treatment because of those adverse events. This suggests that hypotension can be adequately managed by withholding doses and reducing the dose of medication according to blood pressure changes.</P>
<P>There is currently insufficient information available to compare lofexidine and methadone in terms of overall adverse effects, but what information is available indicates that blood pressure changes associated with lofexidine are not significantly greater than blood pressure changes associated with reducing doses of methadone. Direct comparison of lofexidine and clonidine indicates that lofexidine is associated with fewer adverse effects, particularly less frequent hypotensive events. On this basis, lofexidine should be preferred for withdrawal in an outpatient setting where monitoring of blood pressure and management of hypotension by withholding doses of medication is more difficult.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data available to support a conclusion on the efficacy of guanfacine, or other medications with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic properties, such as tizanidine.</P>
<P>Overall, we detected no significant difference in efficacy of the alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists clonidine and lofexidine for the management of withdrawal from heroin compared with reducing doses of methadone over a period of about 10 days.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-11 16:51:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains limited information on the relative efficacy of clonidine, lofexidine, and particularly guanfacine. These three alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists should be compared systematically in terms of amelioration of the signs and symptoms of withdrawal, time in treatment, capacity to support completion of withdrawal, and the occurrence of adverse effects including lethargy, fatigue, dry mouth, and hypotensive effects.</P>
<P>An alternative approach to improving the information available on comparative efficacy would be to undertake a post-marketing survey of clonidine, similar to that undertaken with lofexidine. While it would not have the rigour of a randomised controlled trial, it would provide an indication of the performance of clonidine (a drug that is in widespread use for the management of opioid withdrawal) in routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>There remains uncertainty as to the nature of withdrawal signs and symptoms that are not significantly ameliorated by treatment with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists. It would be valuable to investigate adjunct medications that address the symptoms that are a problem for patients. These are likely to include sleep disturbances, anxiety, and aches and pains, which are suggested by studies included in this review to be incompletely suppressed by both alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone.</P>
<P>It would be useful to further investigate the efficacy of the alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists in managing withdrawal from different types of opioid drugs. In particular, it would be useful to determine the effect of the type of opioid drug, dose, route, and duration of use prior to withdrawal, including the effects of a prolonged period of opioid substitution treatment. Given that people who are dependent on opioid drugs are likely also to use other drugs, particularly benzodiazepines, cocaine, and alcohol, it would also be relevant to investigate the efficacy of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists when polydrug dependence is involved. There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of setting on the effectiveness of alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal. There is a trend globally towards withdrawal being managed on an outpatient or day-care basis, making this an area of priority for research.</P>
<P>An aspect of considerable clinical relevance in considering the efficacy of approaches to the management of opioid withdrawal is the capacity to promote engagement in further treatment. We identified engagement in further treatment as an outcome of interest for this review, but was unable to assess it with the studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The response to different approaches to the management of opioid withdrawal may vary with individual circumstance and the type of follow-up treatment being considered. This suggests that approaches other than randomised controlled trials may be most appropriate to investigate this aspect of opioid withdrawal.</P>
