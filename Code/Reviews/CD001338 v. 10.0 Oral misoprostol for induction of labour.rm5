<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Previously, with only 13 trials in total, most of the comparisons showed no major differences. Now, with over 8600 women randomised in 41 trials, differences between the induction methods are emerging. Oral misoprostol is now found to be more effective than placebo, as effective as oxytocin (in women with ruptured membranes) and possibly more effective than vaginal dinoprostone. With higher doses of misoprostol, uterine hyperstimulation is a problem. A 50 mcg oral dose is as effective as vaginal misoprostol and there is a lower rate of side effects. It may therefore be preferable.<BR/>
<BR/>As with all methods of induction there remain unanswered questions about safety. For rarer outcomes such as uterine rupture or stillbirth the meta-analysis is still too small to demonstrate significant differences. Whilst these doubts remain, the use of products licensed for induction (e.g. dinoprostone and oxytocin) is recommended.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-05 13:19:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Oral misoprostol is effective at inducing (starting) labour. It is more effective than placebo, as effective as vaginal misoprostol and results in fewer caesarean sections than vaginal dinoprostone or oxytocin. However, there are still not enough data from randomised controlled trials to determine the best dose to ensure safety.</P>
<P>Induction of labour in late pregnancy is used to prevent complications when the pregnant woman or her unborn child are at risk. Reasons for induction include being overdue, pre-labour rupture of membranes and high blood pressure. Prostaglandins are hormones that are naturally present in the uterus (womb); they soften the cervix and stimulate contractions in labour. The artificial prostaglandin E2 dinoprostone can be administered vaginally to induce labour but it is unstable at room temperature and is expensive. Oral misoprostol is a cheap and heat stable prostaglandin E1 synthetic analogue originally developed for the treatment of stomach ulcers.</P>
<P>This review of 76 randomised controlled trials (14,412 women) found that oral misoprostol appears to be at least as effective as current methods of induction. Nine trials (1,282 women) showed that oral misoprostol was equivalent to intravenous infusion of oxytocin, but resulted in significantly less caesarean sections. A higher rate of meconium staining of the amniotic fluid was not associated with any adverse effect on the unborn baby and could be a direct effect of the misoprostol on the baby's gut. This effect was also seen in the comparison with vaginal misoprostol but appeared to be less. The 37 thirty seven trials (6,417 women) that compared oral and vaginal misoprostol reported similar effectiveness but those taking oral misoprostol had better neonatal condition at birth and less postpartum haemorrhage.</P>
<P>In 12 twelve trials (3,859 women) comparing oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone, women given misoprostol were less likely to need caesarean section (21% compared with 26% of women), although the induction may have been slower overall. The most common dose of misoprostol in these studies was 20 mcg. The rates of hyperstimulation and meconium staining were similar with misoprostol and dinoprostone.</P>
<P>The nine trials that compared oral misoprostol with placebo (1,109 women) showed that oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo for inducing labour, with a lower caesarean section rate and fewer admissions to neonatal intensive care unit. The quality of evidence for some comparisons was very robust (for example, oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol) but the strength of recommendations was less for other comparisons.</P>

<P>Overall there were 76 trials (14,412) women) which were of mixed quality.</P>
<P>In nine trials comparing oral misoprostol with placebo (1109 women), women using oral misoprostol were more likely to give birth vaginally within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.49; one trial; 96 women), need less oxytocin (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.49; seven trials; 933 women) and have a lower caesarean section rate (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95; eight trials; 1029 women).</P>
<P>In 12 trials comparing oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone (3859 women), women given oral misoprostol were less likely to need a caesarean section (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 11 trials; 3592 women). There was some evidence that they had slower inductions, but there were no other statistically significant differences.</P>
<P>Nine trials (1282 women) compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin. The caesarean section rate was significantly lower in women who received oral misoprostol (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98; nine trials; 1282 women), but they had increased rates of meconium-stained liquor (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.60; seven trials; 1172 women).</P>
<P>Thirty-seven trials (6417 women) compared oral and vaginal misoprostol and found no statistically significant difference in the primary outcomes of serious neonatal morbidity/death or serious maternal morbidity or death. The results for vaginal birth not achieved in 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes, and caesarean section were highly heterogenous - for uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes this was related to dosage with lower rates in those with lower doses of oral misoprostol. However, there were fewer babies born with a low Apgar score in the oral group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; 19 trials; 4009 babies) and a decrease in postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95; 10 trials; 1478 women). However, the oral misoprostol group had an increase in meconium-stained liquor (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.44; 24 trials; 3634 women).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-19 11:21:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Oral misoprostol as an induction agent is effective at achieving vaginal birth. It is more effective than placebo, as effective as vaginal misoprostol and results in fewer caesarean sections than vaginal dinoprostone or oxytocin.</P>
<P>Where misoprostol remains unlicensed for the induction of labour, many practitioners will prefer to use a licensed product like dinoprostone. If using oral misoprostol, the evidence suggests that the dose should be 20 to 25 mcg in solution. Given that safety is the primary concern, the evidence supports the use of oral regimens over vaginal regimens. This is especially important in situations where the risk of ascending infection is high and the lack of staff means that women cannot be intensely monitored.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-19 11:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.</P>
<P>Induction of labour is a common clinical situation. The reasons for an induction are either clinical (post-term pregnancy, prelabour rupture of membranes, hypertensive disorders) or social (parents' and clinicians' convenience).</P>
<P>Prostaglandins have been widely used for labour induction, particularly if the cervix is not 'favourable' (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1993</LINK>). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 or dinoprostone) appears to be the prostaglandin of choice when used vaginally in the form of gel, tablets or pessaries. Unfortunately, vaginal PGE2 preparations are expensive and unstable at room temperature.</P>
<P>Oral administration of prostaglandins is less effective (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1989</LINK>) and has been virtually abandoned, mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects. However, interest in oral prostaglandins has increased with the introduction of a new synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue - misoprostol. This drug is used mainly for the prevention and treatment of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcers of the digestive tract. It is relatively cheap and stable at room temperature. Used for this indication, oral misoprostol is usually given in two to four doses of 200 micrograms (mcg) per day and the time to maximum concentration is 10 to 20 minutes (versus 60 to 80 minutes in the case of vaginal administration, <LINK REF="REF-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdel-Aleem 2003</LINK>). Side effects are dose dependent and are mainly confined to the digestive tract, such as diarrhoea and nausea (<LINK REF="REF-Garris-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garris 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uterine contractions induced by misoprostol are often strong enough to expel products of conception in early pregnancy. Widespread use of misoprostol in Brazil for termination of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1993</LINK>) resulted in the identification of teratogenic effects including abnormalities of extremities (clubfoot, agenesis of the feet and hands, syndactyly, constriction rings) and Mobius sequence (loss of function of the motor cranial nerves, especially VI, VII and XII) (<LINK REF="REF-Fonseca-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonseca 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pastuszak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pastuszak 1998</LINK>). These defects affect less than 1% of exposed fetuses (<LINK REF="REF-Philip-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philip 2002</LINK>). Maternal death from uterine rupture at 16 weeks' gestation after self-medication with misoprostol has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Randomised trials, which have evaluated the effectiveness of a vaginally administered misoprostol for labour induction with a viable fetus, have been reviewed for <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK>). Oral use is particularly attractive because of easy and non-invasive administration. However, there are inherent risks of such an approach. An overdose, causing uterine hyperstimulation may precipitate labour, and may be life-threatening for both mother and fetus. It is therefore, important that oral misoprostol is evaluated in a systematic fashion to assess if it can be recommended for routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>Despite having been widely studied for several reproductive health indications, misoprostol's licence has never been extended. This is thought to be due to the manufacturer's concerns about potential adverse publicity generated by the powerful US anti-abortion lobby. Off-label drug use is common in obstetrics, and includes many drugs, which would be considered mandatory in everyday practice (e.g. corticosteroids to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome after premature labour and oxytocin 10 international units intramuscularly to prevent postpartum haemorrhage). Despite this, many practitioners are concerned about the potential legal consequences of using an off-label drug should a serious adverse event occur, especially if an effective licensed alternative is available (<LINK REF="REF-Weeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeks 2005</LINK>). Now that the patent for misoprostol has expired, generic misoprostol products licensed for reproductive health indications have become available in various parts of the world such as Brazil, France and Egypt. The arrival of licensed products will ease the medico-legal concerns of those wishing to use misoprostol for induction of labour.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-14 14:39:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Induction of labour is used to bring an end to pregnancy when the benefits of giving birth at that time outweigh the risks of the induction process.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-20 15:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral misoprostol is given as a regular medication to pregnant women either as a tablet or in solution. The dosage and form of the medication varies, but it is generally used only until the woman's cervix is fully ripened. If further uterine stimulation is required after this, an intravenous infusion of oxytocin is generally used until birth, although some studies have continued the use of low-dose misoprostol.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-17 09:16:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Similar to other prostaglandins, oral misoprostol acts on the uterus to soften (or 'ripen') the cervix and to stimulate contractions.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-19 11:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Oral misoprostol is a low-cost and effective method for induction which is in common use in many parts of the world. Until recently, the drug was not licensed for use in pregnancy and so the drug manufacturers had neither formally evaluated it nor packaged the drug for induction of labour. There has been confusion therefore over which misoprostol regimen to use, and the use of excessive doses in late pregnancy has been thought to have been responsible for serious complications including uterine rupture. A formal evaluation of the many published studies is therefore very important to guide national and international recommendations for its appropriate use.</P>

<P>We will not discuss any of the comparisons listed above without relevant trials in this review. For the details of this selection strategy, please refer to <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>.</P>
<P>In previously published versions of this review, we proposed to compare low-, medium- and high-dose regimens. We defined low-dose regimens as less than 50 micrograms (mcg), medium-dose as 50 to 100 mcg inclusive and high-dose as more than 100 mcg. These arbitrary groups proved impractical because most trials used either 25 mcg, 50 mcg or 100 mcg doses. In order to study dose-related effects, we decided to group regimens into: (i) 0 to 25 mcg, (ii) 26 to 50 mcg, (iii) 51 to 199 mcg and (iv) 200 mcg or more. We acknowledge that this change has been driven to some extent by the trials' data and is therefore a potential source of bias. Also, the same dose can be given at varying intervals (usually between two and six hours) and these differences could influence the primary outcomes. 'Low-dose' regimens with two-hourly administration may result in a higher cumulative dose over 24 hours than 'high-dose' regimens. However, the plasma half-life of oral misoprostol is short (20 to 40 minutes) and, therefore, it would appear that dose is more important than frequency. Consequently, at least at this point in time, we have not planned analyses based on frequency of administration.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2014-04-10 13:20:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic) prespecified the clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction. After discussion a consensus has been reached by all registered Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group review authors with an interest in labour induction.</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2013-05-14 09:44:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We chose five primary outcomes as being most representative of the clinically important measures of ineffectiveness and complications:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (includes all caesarean sections);<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but fewer babies with severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. We will explore the incidence of individual components as secondary outcomes.</P>

<P>Measures of ineffectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>

<P>While we have sought all of the above outcomes, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting two minutes or more) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability).</P>
<P>Outcomes are included in the analysis if data were available according to original allocation and reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias.</P>
<P>Only outcomes with available data appear in the analysis tables. We have, nevertheless, extracted and reported data on outcomes that were not prestated above. However, we have clearly labelled them as such ('not prespecified'). In order to minimise the risk of bias, we have based the conclusions solely on the prestated outcomes.</P>

<LI>nulliparity or multiparity;</LI>
<LI>membranes intact or ruptured;</LI>
<LI>cervix favourable, unfavourable or undefined.</LI>

<P>For most reviews, the initial data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews. From 2001, the data extraction was no longer conducted centrally.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, a standardised data extraction form was developed and then piloted for consistency and completeness. This pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous review authors in the area of induction of labour.

In <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>, women were randomised three ways: to placebo, 50 mcg or 100 mcg misoprostol. As 50 mcg is the most commonly recommended dose for oral misoprostol, we chose to include only the outcomes for the placebo versus 50 mcg dose. We have also included the outcomes for the 50 mcg versus 100 mcg doses in that section of the review. In <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2001</LINK> women in both arms received dinoprostone after 12 hours if not in active labour.

<P>Four exclusions are potentially controversial. We have excluded the study by <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 1997</LINK> because 138 women in the comparator group were induced with four different methods (intracervical dinoprostone, vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, vaginal misoprostol). We felt that these methods are too different to be compared to oral misoprostol as one intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Ascher_x002d_Walsh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ascher-Walsh 2000</LINK> used oral misoprostol to achieve spontaneous onset of labour, i.e. oral misoprostol or placebo were given in three-day intervals between 40 and 42 weeks of pregnancy. This review with its clinical outcomes concentrates on methods to achieve vaginal birth as quickly as possible, so we decided to exclude this trial.The study by <LINK REF="STD-Zvandasara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zvandasara 2008</LINK> was excluded as it included women with intrauterine fetal death (four women). Finally,the study by <LINK REF="STD-Rasheed-2007-_x0028_V50_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rasheed 2007 (V50)</LINK> included data on 25 women who were not randomised.These women were undergoing induction of labour with oral misoprostol (their normal unit induction method) just before the trial started. We therefore included their data with the oral misoprostol arm within the data set from the 285 women who were in the randomised group. The additional data has resulted in an uneven balance between the groups (165 versus 145), and the data derived from those randomised alone are not retrievable from the manuscript.</P>
<P>A number of studies were excluded as they used a combination of techniques. We excluded the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Kadanali-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kadanali 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bricker-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bricker 2008</LINK> because they used vaginal misoprostol followed by oral administration. These studies are therefore included in the Cochrane review of vaginal misoprostol by <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Neto-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Neto 1988</LINK> concentrated on the uterine effects of oral and vaginal misoprostol. Five women received oral misoprostol in the dose of 200 mcg four-hourly, five women received 400 mcg four-hourly and five women received a single 200 mcg tablet vaginally. The reported outcomes included initiation, dynamics and duration of uterine contractions. Clinical outcomes were not reported and we have therefore excluded the study. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Bozhinova-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bozhinova 2007</LINK> as the comparison of oral misoprostol was with combined vaginal and sublingual misoprostol. <LINK REF="STD-Delaney-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Delaney 2001</LINK> was excluded as women had an artificial rupture of membranes performed at study entry and the oxytocin or oral misoprostol was only used for those who were not in labour one hour later.</P>
<P>We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2010</LINK> as it is a study of labour augmentation in women with 'failure to progress in labour' rather than labour induction.</P>
<P>As reported above, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Moodley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moodley 2003</LINK> had three arms.

The treatment was not blinded in the other trials. Under those circumstances, there is a real possibility of bias, both in clinical decision making and assessment of outcomes. A clinician with a prior belief that oral misoprostol is effective and safe might be less likely to perform a caesarean section in case of fetal distress or slow labour. On the other hand, a clinician who is anxious about possible risks of the new treatment may be more likely to intervene.</P>

<P>There was wide variation in the outcomes reported in the studies, and some were not consistent with the outcomes in this review. So whilst 'vaginal birth within 24 hours' is an important summary primary outcome in this review, it is rarely used by trialists, many of whom prefer a continuous variable of time to birth (which is not one of the Cochrane outcomes). Similarly not all published papers use the strict Cochrane definition of hyperstimulation with or without fetal heart rate abnormalities despite these being important outcomes. In assessing these outcomes, the authors have had to use judgement in matching the reported outcomes (for example "hyperstimulation") with the predefined Cochrane outcomes. Increasingly, however, trialists are turning to the Cochrane reviews for their selection of outcomes, and so recent high-quality studies are well matched to the Cochrane outcomes set.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Comparison with placebo (analyses 1 to 4)</HEADING>
<P>Nine trials with 1109 participating women in total compared oral misoprostol with placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes:</B> women using oral misoprostol were more likely to give birth vaginally within 24 hours (although this was only assessed in one trial of 96 women (risk ratio (RR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.49) in which women in both arms were given dinoprostone after 12 hours), <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. Oral misoprostol was associated with lower caesarean section (CS) rates (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95), <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes: </B>oral misoprostol was also associated with less oxytocin augmentation (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.49), <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>, and fewer admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.56), <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>. There were no other clinically important differences in prespecified outcomes, including measures of uterine hyperstimulation. Most of the women studied had ruptured membranes, and analysis confined to this subgroup demonstrated similar findings to the overall analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroups: </B>in the subgroup of all women with ruptured membranes, there was a significant increase in the number of women with a vaginal birth within 24 hours (one study of 96 women, RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.49), <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>. In the subgroups of all women with intact membranes and primigravid women with ruptured membranes, there were no significant changes in the primary outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Comparison with vaginal dinoprostone (analyses 5 to 11)</HEADING>
<P>A total of 3859 women were randomised to oral misoprostol or vaginal dinoprostone in 12 trials. The most common dose of misoprostol used in these studies was 20 mcg oral solution given two-hourly.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes:</B> a significant decrease was seen in CS rate in those treated with oral misoprostol (21% versus 26%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99), <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>. The difference in the number of women not achieving vaginal birth within 24 hours was not statistically significant (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.20), <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>,</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes: w</B>omen treated with misoprostol more frequently had an unchanged cervix after 12 to 24 hours (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.96), <LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6</LINK>. There were no other statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the outcomes, including hyperstimulation rates and frequency of meconium-stained liquor.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroups: </B>seven trials (n = 2481) provided the data for a subgroup of women with intact membranes. The data were similar to the overall results, with women induced with misoprostol having fewer CSs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.93), <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>, but slower labours with increased rates of unchanged cervix after 12 to 24 hours (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.20), <LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>. There were no other significant differences.</P>
<P>Only two trials provided the data for women with ruptured membranes and there were only data for two outcomes. The number of women who did not achieve vaginal birth within 24 hours was reduced in the misoprostol group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97), <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>, i.e. induction with oral misoprostol achieved vaginal birth within the first 24 hours more frequently compared with vaginal dinoprostone. There were no other significant differences in primary outcomes between the subgroups.</P>
<P>Only one study recruited women with previous CSs (n = 267) of which 23 had previous CS. No uterine ruptures were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Comparison with intracervical prostaglandin E2 (analyses 12, 13 and 14)</HEADING>
<P>This comparison was found in five trials, involving 681 women randomised to oral misoprostol or intracervical dinoprostone. Four trials included only women with intact membranes and one included only women with ruptured membranes. Three used misoprostol doses of 50 mcg (352 women) and two used 200 mcg (two trials, 390 women).</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes:</B> the rate of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes was significantly higher in those treated with misoprostol (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.11 to 11.54), <LINK REF="CMP-012.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.2</LINK>. However, significantly more women in the oral misoprostol group achieved vaginal birth within 24 hours (39% versus 49%, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97), <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes: </B>the rate of uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes was significantly higher in those treated with misoprostol (RR 6.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 34.31), <LINK REF="CMP-012.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.8</LINK>. Only one study considered maternal dissatisfaction, and this was lower in those treated with oral misoprostol (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96), <LINK REF="CMP-012.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.19</LINK>. There were no other differences between the groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroups: </B>the subgroups for those with intact membranes found the oral misoprostol group to have a significantly higher rate of uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes (RR 4.60, 95% CI 1.19 to 17.80), <LINK REF="CMP-013.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.2</LINK>. There was an increase in the number of women with a vaginal birth within 24 hours but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.00), <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>. In the subgroup with ruptured membranes, there was only one study and this showed no significant difference in any of the primary outcomes.</P>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity for the 'need for oxytocin' outcome (I² = 80%), <LINK REF="CMP-012.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.7</LINK>. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis indicated that this was not related to the poor quality study or dose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(4) Comparison with intravenous oxytocin (analyses 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19)</HEADING>
<P>Nine trials including 1282 women have compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin. Five studies used 100 mcg (818 women), two studies used 50 mcg (178 women), one used 20 mcg solution (30 women) and one study used 25 mcg solution (256 women).</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes: </B>the CS rate was significantly lower in women who received oral misoprostol (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98), <LINK REF="CMP-015.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.3</LINK>, but there were no significant differences seen in any of the other primary outcomes. However, the meta-analysis of uterine hyperstimulation syndrome indicated substantial heterogeneity, <LINK REF="CMP-015.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.2</LINK>. This may be explained by the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Crane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crane 2003</LINK>. which used a dose of 75 mcg four-hourly. That study found significantly less hyperstimulation with misoprostol, whilst the remainder found no difference.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes: </B>meconium staining of the liquor was seen more frequently in the misoprostol group (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.60), <LINK REF="CMP-015.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.11</LINK>, but this was not reflected in significant differences in any adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes.There were no other statistically significant differences between the oral misoprostol and intravenous oxytocin groups (except for oxytocin use, which was naturally higher in the oxytocin group).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroups: </B>in six of the trials (758 women) there were outcome data for women with ruptured membranes. In this subgroup, the percentage of women with meconium-stained liquor (and the RR) was similar to that in the overall results (<LINK REF="CMP-015.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.11</LINK>), but the reduced numbers meant that the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.23), <LINK REF="CMP-016.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.6</LINK>.</P>
<P>There were no data reported for the subgroup of women with intact membranes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(5) Comparison with sublingual misoprostol (analysis 20)</HEADING>
<P>There was just one study of poor methodological quality in this comparison which compared 50 mcg of oral, vaginal and sublingual misoprostol (50 in each group, <LINK REF="STD-Elhassan-2007-_x0028_V50_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Elhassan 2007 (V50)</LINK>). There was no significant difference in CS rate, but the oral misoprostol group had significantly higher rates of meconium-stained liquor than the sublingual misoprostol group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 4.07 to 27.09), <LINK REF="CMP-020.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.2</LINK>, and significantly lower rates of instrumental vaginal birth (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99), <LINK REF="CMP-020.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.3</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(6) Comparison with vaginal misoprostol (analyses 21 to 29)</HEADING>
<P>This was the most commonly studied comparison, with 37 trials and 6417 randomised women.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes: </B>the overall outcome for the rate of uterine hyperstimulation <I>with</I> FHR changes was highly heterogenous. The interaction test indicated that there was a significant difference between dosage subgroups (Test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 18.50, df = 3 (P = 0.0003), I² = 83.8%) with less hyperstimulation in the 25 mcg oral misoprostol dose (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.19), rising to an increase in hyperstimulation with the 200 mcg oral misoprostol dose (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.43), <LINK REF="CMP-021.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.2</LINK>. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the overall result was not affected by the removal of low-quality studies.</P>
<P>The overall outcome for vaginal birth within 24 hours was also highly heterogenous, <LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK>, but the interaction test did not indicate a subgroup difference in relation to oral misoprostol dosage. Sensitivity analysis with removal of the low-quality studies did not explain the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The overall outcomes for the CS rate was also heterogenous (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.06; Chi² = 60.78, df = 34 (P = 0.003); I² = 44%), <LINK REF="CMP-021.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.3</LINK>. The heterogeneity was not affected by the removal of low-quality studies and the interaction test showed that there was no significant interaction between dosage subgroups.</P>
<P>There were no other significant findings in the two remaining primary outcomes.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Efficacy compared to other induction agents</HEADING>
<P>Oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo and equivalent to intravenous oxytocin for the induction of labour in women. In the comparisons with oxytocin infusions, there seems to be a higher rate of meconium staining at all dosages, but this was not associated with any adverse effect on the fetus. It is possible that the meconium staining could be a direct effect of the misoprostol on the fetal gut. Gastrointestinal stimulation leading to diarrhoea is a well-described side effect of oral misoprostol in adults, and small amounts of misoprostol in the fetus could lead to the expulsion of meconium and hence meconium-stained liquor. This effect is also seen with vaginal misoprostol, but it appears to be smaller. This may be due to the lower peak serum concentrations that occur following vaginal administration.</P>
<P>Compared with vaginal dinoprostone, oral misoprostol reduces the need for caesarean section (CS), but this reduction appears to come at the 'cost' of a slightly slower induction. An increase in the number of women in whom 'vaginal birth was not achieved within 24 hours' (which was of borderline significance) includes both women who have a prolonged induction and who underwent emergency CS. Given that the rates of CS are consistently decreased with oral misoprostol, and that the number of women with an unchanged cervix after 12 to 24 hours is increased, the overall picture is of a longer induction period with oral misoprostol. Given that the primary aim of induction is for the woman to have an uncomplicated vaginal birth rather than a rapid birth, most would consider that this is a price worth paying.</P>
<P>There have been concerns in the past about uterine hyperstimulation with oral misoprostol. In studies where most women were given 20 mcg two-hourly, the hyperstimulation rates were the same as for vaginal dinoprostone (i.e. around 5% overall; 3.5% have fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities).</P>
<P>There were fewer studies comparing oral misoprostol and intracervical dinoprostone, but these found that the oral misoprostol (at doses of 50 and 100 mcg) resulted in stronger contractions than the dinoprostone. This led to higher rates of hyperstimulation and a more rapid labour, but with no effect on fetal outcomes.</P>
<P>Whilst no increase in adverse fetal outcomes was seen in these studies, this meta-analysis contains too few studies to exclude a difference in adverse outcomes which are rare (<I>see</I> additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for numbers needed). However, the comparable safety data on vaginal dinoprostone are also limited. There are 14,000+ women in the trials in this review, which compares favourably with the Cochrane review of the current standard treatment vaginal dinoprostone (PGE2) with 10,000 women (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Should misoprostol be used orally or vaginally?</HEADING>
<P>The large variety of doses of both oral and vaginal misoprostol used in the direct comparisons make it very difficult to interpret these data. The only consistent findings were a reduction in low Apgar score at five minutes in those given oral misoprostol (but there is no corresponding reduction in special baby care unit admission), lower rates of postpartum haemorrhage, and an increase in meconium-stained liquor. The cause of the improved Apgars in those given oral misoprostol is not clear, but it may relate to the hyperstimulation rates, which were generally lower in those given low-dose oral misoprostol. The relative acceptability of the oral and vaginal routes also need to be considered alongside this clinical data. Satisfaction was only considered in one study of 200 women (<LINK REF="STD-Colon-2005-_x0028_V25_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Colon 2005 (V25)</LINK>), and in this study only two women (one in each group) expressed dissatisfaction. However, other clinical studies comparing oral and vaginal misoprostol have found increased satisfaction with the oral route.</P>
<P>In summary, there is some evidence that the oral route may result in improved clinical outcomes over the vaginal route. Given the likely greater acceptability for women using an oral route, it is the authors' opinion that the oral route should be preferred over the vaginal route.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is the optimal dose of oral misoprostol?</HEADING>
<P>The comparison with vaginal misoprostol is complicated by the wide variation in dosages used for both vaginal and oral misoprostol. Hence a comparison between 50 mcg oral misoprostol and 100 mcg vaginal misoprostol may give very different outcomes to a comparison between 200 mcg oral misoprostol and 25 mcg vaginal misoprostol. This is especially important given that both efficacy and side effects are a function of the ability of misoprostol to produce effective uterine contractions. The optimal dose will have to balance the desire for short induction to birth interval with impact of strong, effective uterine contractions on the fetal wellbeing and uterine muscle integrity.</P>
<P>An attempt to assess the effect of dose on effectiveness and safety has been made with the subgroup analyses by various doses of oral misoprostol. This has resulted in multiple subgroup analyses with a high potential for spurious results (type I error). To protect against this, we have analysed further the subgroups with significant heterogeneity within the results. We have used the interaction test (a form of chi-squared test) to assess the association with dosage. We chose uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes as the outcome most closely representing a bioassay of misoprostol activity. The relative strength of various misoprostol dosages given vaginally and orally is best seen in the graph for outcome 21.8, where similar hyperstimulation rates are seen when the dose of oral misoprostol is about double that of the vaginal doses. Similarly, the use of the same doses orally and vaginally results in generally lower hyperstimulation rates in the oral group. This suggests that equivalent biological activity is seen when the dose of oral misoprostol is about double that of the vaginal dose. Given that the Cochrane review of vaginal misoprostol suggests a dosage of 25 mcg vaginal misoprostol, it might be expected that the optimal dose (i.e. that which is equivalent to vaginal dinoprostone) would be 50 mcg. In the comparison with vaginal dinoprostone, most trials used oral misoprostol dosages of 20 to 25 mcg and it is the trials using this dose that have shown the reduction in CS rate (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>). Overall, therefore, the results of this review suggest that the optimal dosage of oral misoprostol is 20 to 25 mcg given two-hourly.</P>
<P>Obtaining a misoprostol dosage of 25 mcg tablets by cutting a 200 mcg tablet into eighths is difficult and imprecise. To get around this, the studies that used 20 to 25 mcg have generally dissolved the 200 mcg tablet in 200 mL water and administered 20 mL. Bioassays suggest that misoprostol remains active for at least 24 hours in this form (<LINK REF="REF-Matonhodze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matonhodze 2005</LINK>). Whilst this will undoubtedly produce a more precise dose, there are ongoing issues around the storage of the unused solution. In view of the lack of good information about the stability of misoprostol in solution and the risks involved in having unused solution sitting around in containers on a labour ward, the best advice would be to discard any unused solution after administering each dose. The recent availability of misoprostol 25 mcg tablets is welcome and should overcome many of these problems.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risks of induction</HEADING>
<P>Some observational studies have reported a high uterine rupture rate when vaginal misoprostol was given to women who have had previous CSs. There is less evidence for oral misoprostol, but there were rupture rates of 10% (one of 10) and 9.7% (four of 41) in two studies that used oral misoprostol for induction (<LINK REF="REF-Aslan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aslan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gherman-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherman 2001a</LINK>). Whilst the lack of ruptures in the 158 women in this review's randomised trials who underwent induction is encouraging (<LINK REF="STD-Carlan-2001-_x0028_V50_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Carlan 2001 (V50)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-How-2001-_x0028_V25_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">How 2001 (V25)</LINK>), it would take a trial of over 60,000 women to evaluate whether there was an increase in the 0.5% background scar rupture rate in women undergoing a trial of vaginal birth (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no consensus on what constitutes an acceptable risk of labour induction in the absence of life-threatening conditions for mother and baby. It is likely that most parents and clinicians would not be prepared to accept a 0.5% to 1% increase in serious adverse outcomes. In fact, it is likely that women would be prepared to spend more time on delivery suite if this means a safer labour, but there is a noticeable lack of data on this. Indeed, most studies in this review did not assess women's views or satisfaction rates.</P>
<P>Currently available data are nowhere near large enough to address the issue of safety of either the induction process (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) ar the long-term follow-up of babies exposed to misoprostol. It is important to reiterate here that 'no evidence of difference' in this Cochrane review does not mean 'evidence of no difference'. In other words, when even more randomised data become available, small but important clinical differences between various regimens may become apparent, i.e. statistically significant.</P>
<P>Trials or meta-analyses that have adequate power to address the issue of rare adverse fetal outcomes will need to include an excess of 30,000 women. Until the logistics and financial resources are available to conduct such studies, alternative ways must be found of assessing the risk. Registries of women using oral misoprostol for induction may be a way of achieving this.</P>

<P>In nine trials comparing oral misoprostol with placebo (1109 women, almost all with ruptured membranes), women using oral misoprostol were more likely to give birth vaginally within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.49; one study in which all women received dinoprostone after 12 hours), needed less oxytocin (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.49; seven studies; 933 women) and had a lower CS rate (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95, eight studies 1029 women).</P>
<P>In 12 trials comparing oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone (3859 participants), women given oral misoprostol were less likely to need a CS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 11 studies 3592 women). There was some evidence that they had slower inductions, but there were no other significant differences.</P>
<P>Nine trials (1282 participants) compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin. The CS rate was significantly lower in women received oral misoprostol (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98, nine studies, 1282 women), but they had increased rates of meconium-stained liquor (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.60; seven trials; 1172 women).</P>
<P>Thirty-seven trials (6417 participants) compared oral and vaginal misoprostol and found no difference in the primary outcomes. However, there were fewer babies born with a low Apgar score in the oral misoprostol group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82, 19 studies, 4009 women) and fewer women with postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95, 10 trials, 1478 women), but increases in meconium-stained liquor (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.44, 24 studies, 3634 women).</P>

<P>With 76 studies included in the review, there has been the opportunity to examine an extensive range of misoprostol regimens and comparisons with other induction methods. The studies have also been conducted in a wide range of settings, making the results applicable internationally. The studies have all however been conducted in settings where the participants can be closely monitored. This will reduce the risk to the baby of any uterine hyperstimulation, but means that the results may not be applicable to setting where fetal monitoring is not available. In those settings, priority should be given to induction methods with low rates of hyperstimulation and/or fetal risks.</P>

<P>There is adequate high-quality evidence within the 71 studies to make robust recommendations. There is however, a wide spread of oral misoprostol regimens examined in this review and a large variation in the quality of studies and reports. So whilst the quality of evidence for some comparisons is very robust (for example, oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol), for other less common comparisons the strength of the recommendations must be lower (e.g. in those comparisons of different misoprostol regimens). With so many comparisons within the review, there is also a risk of statistical type 1 error, that is a false-positive result. The results in which there are very few studies, or heterogeneity, or those in which the meta-analysis result is of borderline statistical significance must therefore be treated with caution, and we have sought to do this.</P>

<P>This review is one of several reviews within <I>The Cochrane Library</I> on induction techniques, but the only one that directly addresses the use of oral misoprostol. The World Health Organization, in preparation for their recommendations for the induction of labour, conducted an extensive review into all forms of induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Their conclusion was that "oral misoprostol (25 mcg, two-hourly) is recommended for induction of labour" along with other methods including dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol (25 mcg) and cervical balloon catheter. A review focusing specifically on low-dose oral misoprostol (20 to 25 mcg) was carried out using the Cochrane methodology by Kundodyiwa et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kundodyiwa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kundodyiwa 2009</LINK>). The findings were similar to this review and the authors concluded that "low-dose oral misoprostol solution (20 mcg) administered every two hours seems at least as effective as both vaginal dinoprostone and vaginal misoprostol, with lower rates of caesarean birth and uterine hyperstimulation, respectively".</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-19 11:33:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Oral misoprostol as an induction agent is effective at achieving vaginal birth. It is more effective than placebo and results in fewer caesarean sections than the current gold standard, vaginal dinoprostone. For women with ruptured membranes, it has similar efficacy to oxytocin, but results in less caesarean sections. Oral misoprostol 20 to 50 mcg is as effective as vaginal misoprostol, and has lower rates of low Apgar scores and postpartum haemorrhage.</P>
<P>There had been concerns about high rates of hyperstimulation with oral misoprostol, despite the fact that this had never been shown to cause any increase in adverse fetal outcomes. With low doses of oral misoprostol, this does not appear to be a problem. Rates of hyperstimulation are equivalent to both placebo and the current gold standard, vaginal dinoprostone. Comparisons with vaginal misoprostol are made difficult by the wide variety of doses of both oral and vaginal misoprostol used, which results in significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Although there were no reported uterine ruptures in the 160 women in this review who were induced with misoprostol having had a previous caesarean sections, observational studies suggest that the uterine rupture rate is high with misoprostol, even when used in low doses. We therefore continue to recommend that it should not be used for women with previous caesarean section scars.</P>
<P>In deciding whether to change to oral misoprostol from dinoprostone, practitioners will need to balance the advantages of low-dose oral misoprostol (reduced caesarean section rate, low cost, heat stability and oral administration) against the problems resulting from the lack of a 25 mcg oral formulation (inaccuracies in dosage and the risks of making up the dosage oneself). If using oral misoprostol, the evidence suggests that the dose 20 to 25 mcg in solution and report serious adverse outcomes. Given that the primary consideration should be safety of induction, the evidence supports the use of oral regimens (using a maximum of 50 mcg) over vaginal regimens. This is especially important in situations where the risk of ascending infection is high and staffing levels mean that women undergoing induction cannot be intensely monitored (i.e. having one-to-one care and electronic fetal monitoring).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-19 11:33:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Methodologically sound clinical trials continue to be a priority, both in developing and industrialised countries. Ideally, these trials should be blinded and be limited to low-dose oral misoprostol (20 to 50 mcg). A randomised examination comparing different regimens would be helpful to determine whether the labour intensive one- to two-hourly administration is necessary, and the relative benefits of oral solution and the newly available 25 mcg tablets. Unblinded studies are prone to biased reporting of outcomes such as randomisation (induction) to birth interval, uterine hyperstimulation, fetal distress and maternal side effects. Also, in unblinded trials the threshold to perform caesarean section may vary according to the clinician's prior beliefs on the safety of misoprostol. On the other hand, administration of vaginal placebo may increase the number of vaginal examinations, influence clinical decision making and introduce bias in the assessment of women's and clinicians' views.</P>
<P>Any proposed dose regimen includes a trade-off between rapid birth and uterine hyperstimulation. Qualitative studies are required to assess how much emphasis women place on a short labour compared with increased perinatal risks that may be associated with shorter labours. Given that this trade-off may vary depending on personality and culture, a flexible approach to dosage may be appropriate.</P>
<P>Only large, pragmatic trials with adequate sample size or large registries will be able to address the risks of uterine hyperstimulation, uterine rupture, serious neonatal and maternal morbidity, and long-term safety. The contact author would be happy to collect the information on serious adverse outcomes associated with the use of oral misoprostol (maternal and perinatal deaths, uterine rupture) and report them, with permission, in future updates of this review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-05-19 11:34:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In previously published versions of this review, we proposed to compare low-, medium- and high-dose regimens. We defined low-dose regimens as less than 50 micrograms (mcg), medium-dose as 50 to 100 mcg inclusive and high-dose as more than 100 mcg. These arbitrary groups proved impractical because most trials used either 25 mcg, 50 mcg or 100 mcg doses. In order to study dose-related effects, we decided to group regimens into: (i) 0 to 25 mcg, (ii) 26 to 50 mcg, (iii) 51 to 199 mcg and (iv) 200 mcg or more. We acknowledge that this change has been driven to some extent by the trials' data and is therefore a potential source of bias. Also, the same dose can be given at varying intervals (usually between two and six hours) and these differences could influence the primary outcomes. 'Low-dose' regimens with two-hourly administration may result in a higher cumulative dose over 24 hours than 'high-dose' regimens. However, the plasma half-life of oral misoprostol is short (20 to 40 minutes) and, therefore, it would appear that dose is more important than frequency. Consequently, at least at this point in time, we have not planned analyses based on frequency of administration.</P>
<P>The methods have been updated to current Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group standards.</P>

<P>The comparator group in this study was managed according to the hospital's established induction protocol. This meant that women in the comparator group were induced either with intracervical dinoprostone (0.5 mg) or intravaginal dinoprostone 1 mg every 6 hours, or intravaginal dinoprostone 2 mg every 6 hours, or dilute oxytocin infusion.

<P>The authors are to be congratulated on their detailed presentation of the randomised trials of the various doses of oral misoprostol. This detail matters because, as they recognise, comparing drugs for induction of labour requires consideration of the doses used and their bio-equivalence as well as routes of administration.</P>
<P>However, their two main conclusions are not justified by the data they so carefully present, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>That oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo, and results in fewer Caesareans than vaginal dinoprostone, and</LI>
<LI>That a low oral dose of 20-25 micrograms should be used, being as effective as vaginal dinoprostone and having lower rates of low Apgar scores and postpartum haemorrhage.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Broadly the evidence for effectiveness/equivalence is based on studies using higher doses of oral misoprostol (&gt;25 micrograms). But the evidence that the oral route causes fewer complications is almost entirely restricted to studies using low oral doses. To describe this in detail:</P>
<P>
<I>1. Evidence that oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo </I>
</P>
<P>Analysis 1.1: The reduction in &#8220;vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours&#8221; with oral misoprostol is based on one trial of 100 micrograms. There is no evidence in trials with lower doses.</P>
<P>Analysis 1.6: No evidence for reduction in &#8220;cervix unfavourable/unchanged&#8221; with any dose. Note this outcome is omitted in Comparison 1 probably in error. Outcome 6 should be cervix unchanged (see page 5 and other tables p 82 ff). Instead &#8216;epidural analgesia&#8217; is the label for outcome 6 here (page 82). Epidural appears again where it should, as Outcome 10, but with another dose and other figures. I therefore assume that Outcome 6 should be cervix unchanged on page 82.</P>
<P>Analysis 1.7: The reduction in &#8220;oxytocin augmentation&#8221; with oral misoprostol is based on one trial with dose not specified, and six trials of &#8805;50 micrograms. There is no evidence for the 25 mcg dose.</P>
<P>
<I>2. Evidence that the oral route is associated with fewer Caesarean sections than vaginal dinoprostone </I>
</P>
<P>Analysis 5.3: The seven trials of the 25 microgram dose showed reduced Caesareans. The four trials of a higher dose show no significant difference.</P>
<P>
<I>Evidence that oral misoprostol 25 mcg is as effective as vaginal dinoprostone</I>
</P>
<P>Analysis 5.6: Oral misoprostol 25 mcg is inferior to vaginal dinoprostone with regard to cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12-24 hours and inconclusive with regard to the outcomes vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (analysis 5.1) and oxytocin augmentation (analysis 5.7).</P>
<P>
<I>3. Evidence that oral misoprostol 25 mcg has lower rates of low Apgar score and postpartum haemorrhage</I>
</P>
<P>Analysis 5.13 and 22: There is no evidence that oral misoprostol 25 mcg or any other dose reduces these outcomes in comparison with vaginal dinoprostone.</P>
<P>
<I>4. Evidence that oral misoprostol causes less uterine hyper-stimulation with fetal heart rate changes</I>
</P>
<P>Analysis 5.2: Five trials of 25 micrograms failed to show reduced hyper-stimulation with fetal heart rate changes compared with vaginal dinoprostone. The two trials of 50 micrograms and the single trial of 100 micrograms show a large, albeit not statistically significant, increase in uterine hyper-stimulation with fetal heart rate changes.</P>
<P>Analysis 21.2: Here, in comparison with vaginal misoprostol, the evidence is less clear cut and does not follow the 25 microgram cut-off. Nevertheless, 16 trials with the 50 micrograms dose show reduced uterine hyper-stimulation with fetal heart rate changes, but the two trials with the 200 micrograms show an increase in uterine hyper-stimulation with fetal heart rate changes.</P>
<P>One interpretation of these data would be that low oral doses of misoprostol (20 to 25 mcg) are probably safe, but there is little or no evidence that they are effective. Higher oral doses are probably effective, but they appear to have broadly similar or increased rates of hyper-stimulation and Caesarean section as the vaginal route comparators. The conclusion that the oral route is both effective AND results in less hyper-stimulation only follows from a crude combination of all the different dosage regimes. An important problem with this approach is that conclusions on various outcomes are based on different sets of studies leading to different sets of dosage regimens. This is particularly problematic when a safety conclusion is based on a set of studies dominated by a low dose and effectiveness is based on studies dominated by higher doses. The specific claim that the low dose of 25 micrograms is effective is not supported by the data.</P>
<P>Of course all these conclusions need to be tempered by the fact that nearly all the trials were small, open label, investigator-led studies, and used with different vaginal comparator doses.</P>
<P>A more conservative, but probably fairer interpretation, would be that despite 76 trials in 14,412 women, we still do not know the risk/benefit ratio of oral misoprostol in its various doses as compared to it or other induction agents administered by the vaginal route.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Handbook chapter 10 section 2.2.1 (1) cautions that duplicate data may overestimate the effect of an intervention. We have identified duplicate data within this Cochrane Review (2).<BR/>
<BR/>In the analysis of oral misoprostol versus vaginal prostaglandin effect on Caesarean section (analysis 5.3)(2), data are reported from seven low dose studies (25 mcg misoprostol). We reread the reports of these seven studies, and in this process found duplicate data in two that calls into question the conclusions of this review.<BR/>
<BR/>The two studies are Hofmeyer 2001 (3) and Matonhodze 2003 (4). Our view that there are duplicate data from these two trials presented in the review is based on several factors. While authorship between the two papers is not identical, the two studies do share the first authors Hofmeyer and Matonhodze. Also, Hofmeyer 2001 is a multicentre study from the UK and South Africa comparing titrated oral misoprostol with vaginal prostaglandin for women with intact or ruptured membranes (3), whilst Matonhodze 2003 was a three arm trial comparing titrated oral misoprostol with vaginal prostaglandin and Foley catheter for women with intact membranes (4). The methods section of both papers state that a sub-set of the South African study population was used twice. Hofmeyer 2001 states: &#8220;At the South African sites women with intact membranes were randomly allocated to three groups, the third being for induction of labor with an extra-amniotic Foley catheter bulb. The result of this comparison will be reported separately&#8221; (3). Matonhodze 2003 (4) says &#8220;A randomized study design was used, nested within the larger trial. Those women with intact membranes enrolled at the South African sites were randomly allocated to Foley catheter/oral misoprostol, oral misoprostol alone or vaginal dinoprostone. This report presents the results of that three-way comparison&#8221;. This paper notes that the larger trial referred to is Hofmeyer2001 (4).</P>
<P>Matonhodze 2003 therefore reused data from the Hofmeyer 2001 study for women from South Africa with intact membranes (4). The number of participants in the two studies differed slightly: Hofmeyer 2001 reports missing data for 4 participants from South Africa, Matonhodze 2003 does not report on missing data, which may explain the small difference between the two study populations.<BR/>
<BR/>We re-calculated analysis 5.3 excluding the possible duplicate data from Matonhodze 2003 (4). Returning to the issue of duplicate data resulting in an overestimation of effects (1), we believe this to be the case here. The Cochrane review found oral misoprostol to be a superior method for induction of labour with a risk ratio for the effect on Caesarean section of 0.83 with 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96 (2). In our analysis the risk ratio is 0.87 with 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01; a result that no longer reaches statistical significance. The review concludes &#8220;oral misoprostol as an induction agent is effective at achieving vaginal birth. It is more effective than placebo, as effective as vaginal misoprostol and results in fewer caesarean sections than vaginal dinoprostone or oxytocin&#8221; (2). However, if we are correct about the duplicate data this would change the conclusion about Caesarean section, and would have further potential consequences as Matonhodze 2003 (4) is used in several other analyses (5.1, 5.2, 5.9, 5.11, 5.13, 5.14, 5.16, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3).<BR/>
<BR/>This Cochrane Review has informed policy and practice around the world. Recently, the Council for the Use of Expensive Hospital Medicines in Denmark (RADS) used this review to recommend low dose oral misoprostol for the induction of labour (5). We reviewed this recommendation and submitted our analysis to the Danish Minister of Health (6), our comments are included in the official report (6). We urge the authors of this review to consider our comments without delay.<BR/>
