<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence of the effects and safety of urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in children with malignancies.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>TLS occurs when uric acid and other cellular substances are rapidly released into the circulation when tumour cells are broken down spontaneously or during treatment. Uric acid does not dissolve easily, therefore it can build up in the kidney, resulting in kidney failure and possibly death. Urate oxidase is an enzyme that can be administered to people at risk of TLS to convert uric acid to allantoin, which is easily dissolved and then readily excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, urate oxidase may be able to prevent or treat TLS in people with malignancies.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to March 2016.</P>
<P>We found seven trials (1074 participants). No new studies were identified in this update. Six studies compared urate oxidase and allopurinol. Three trials tested Uricozyme, and three trials tested rasburicase. One study (30 participants) compared different doses of rasburicase.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The current systematic review of (randomised) controlled clinical trials found that although urate oxidase might be effective in reducing serum uric acid level, it has not been confirmed to reduce renal failure or mortality from TLS in children with cancer. Adverse effects might be more common in people who receive urate oxidase compared with allopurinol. Urate oxidase needs to be further evaluated, especially in high-risk patients, such as those with high-risk leukaemia and lymphoma.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence ranks from very low to low because of imprecise results, and all included trials were highly susceptible to biases.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-03 06:38:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed individual trial quality. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-22 02:38:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials, involving 471 participants in the treatment groups and 603 participants in the control groups. No new studies were identified in the update. One RCT and five CCTs compared urate oxidase and allopurinol. Three trials tested Uricozyme, and three trials tested rasburicase for the prevention of TLS.</P>
<P>The RCT did not evaluate the primary outcome (incidence of clinical TLS). It showed no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (both all-cause mortality (Fisher's exact test P = 0.23) and mortality due to TLS (no deaths in either group)), renal failure (Fisher's exact test P = 0.46), and adverse effects between the treatment and the control groups (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0). The frequency of normalisation of uric acid at four hours (10 out of 10 participants in the treatment group versus zero out of nine participants in the control group, Fisher's exact test P &lt; 0.001) and area under the curve of uric acid at four days (MD -201.00 mg/dLhr, 95% CI -258.05 mg/dLhr to -143.95 mg/dLhr; P &lt; 0.00001) were significantly better in the treatment group.</P>
<P>One CCT evaluated the primary outcome; no clear evidence of a difference was identified between the treatment and the control groups (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.33; P = 0.34). Pooled results of three CCTs showed significantly lower mortality due to TLS in the treatment group (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; P = 0.04); no clear evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality was identified between the groups (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.42; P = 0.26). Pooled results from five CCTs showed significantly lower incidence of renal failure in the treatment group (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.89; P = 0.03). Results of CCTs also showed significantly lower uric acid in the treatment group at two days (three CCTs: MD -3.80 mg/dL, 95% CI -7.37 mg/dL to -0.24 mg/dL; P = 0.04), three days (two CCTs: MD -3.13 mg/dL, 95% CI -6.12 mg/dL to -0.14 mg/dL; P = 0.04), four days (two CCTs: MD -4.60 mg/dL, 95% CI -6.39 mg/dL to -2.81 mg/dL; P &lt; 0.00001), and seven days (one CCT: MD -1.74 mg/dL, 95% CI -3.01 mg/dL to -0.47 mg/dL; P = 0.007) after therapy, but not one day (three CCTs: MD -3.00 mg/dL, 95% CI -7.61 mg/dL to 1.60 mg/dL; P = 0.2), five days (one CCT: MD -1.02 mg/dL, 95% CI -2.24 mg/dL to 0.20 mg/dL; P = 0.1), and 12 days (one CCT: MD -0.80 mg/dL, 95% CI -2.51 mg/dL to 0.91 mg/dL; P = 0.36) after therapy. Pooled results from three CCTs showed higher frequency of adverse effects in participants who received urate oxidase (RR 9.10, 95% CI 1.29 to 64.00; P = 0.03).</P>
<P>Another included RCT, with 30 participants, compared different doses of rasburicase (0.2 mg/kg versus 0.15 mg/kg). The primary outcome was not evaluated. No clear evidence of a difference in mortality (all-cause mortality (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0) and mortality due to TLS (no deaths in both groups)) and renal failure (no renal failure in both groups) was identified. It demonstrated no clear evidence of a difference in uric acid normalisation (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28; P = 0.49) and uric acid level at four hours (MD 8.10%, 95% CI -0.99% to 17.19%; P = 0.08). Common adverse events of urate oxidase included hypersensitivity, haemolysis, and anaemia, but no clear evidence of a difference between treatment groups was identified (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.48; P = 0.42).</P>
<P>The quality of evidence ranks from very low to low because of imprecise results, and all included trials were highly susceptible to biases.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-22 02:38:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although urate oxidase might be effective in reducing serum uric acid, it is unclear whether it reduces clinical TLS, renal failure, or mortality. Adverse effects might be more common for urate oxidase compared with allopurinol. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits of reducing uric acid and uncertain benefits of preventing mortality or renal failure from TLS against the potential risk of adverse effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-24 08:33:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a serious complication of malignancies that can occur spontaneously in the presence of rapidly proliferating tumour cells or during treatment because of rapid cell lysis, leading to release of intracellular components that may result in hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, or hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia and hyperphosphataemia can result in crystallisation in the renal tubules causing obstructive uropathy and renal failure. Other severe consequences of TLS include cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death from hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Navolanic-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navolanic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rampello-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampello 2006</LINK>). The Cairo-Bishop definition for laboratory TLS is the development of any two or more of the following four criteria within three days before or seven days after the initiation of chemotherapy: uric acid level of 8 mg/dL or more; potassium level of 6 mmol/L or more; phosphate level of 6.65 mg/dL or more; and calcium level of 7 mg/dL or less. A 25% increase from baseline for uric acid, potassium, or phosphate levels or a 25% decrease from baseline for calcium level is an alternative threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Cairo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairo 2004</LINK>). The Cairo-Bishop definition for clinical TLS is the presence of laboratory TLS and one or more of the following three criteria: serum creatinine level 1.5 times or more than the upper limit of normal; cardiac arrhythmias; sudden death; or seizures.</P>
<P>Risk factors for TLS include high proliferation rate, large tumour burden, and high chemosensitivity. A high white blood cell (WBC) count in leukaemia (&gt; 50 x 10&#8313;/L) or a high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in lymphoma indicates high tumour burden. Certain malignancies, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, are associated with a very high risk of TLS because of rapid tumour cell turnover (<LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>). The incidence of TLS varies among studies. A retrospective review of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma found that the frequency of TLS was 3.4%, 5.2%, and 6.1%, respectively, and it accounts for 0.9% of cancer mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003a</LINK>). The mortality rate of TLS has been estimated to be about 17.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003a</LINK>). The medical costs of hyperuricaemia and TLS are substantial. The cost of hyperuricaemia without TLS has been estimated to be EUR 672 per patient for the whole treatment, and the cost of TLS, EUR 7342 (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003a</LINK>). The cost of TLS requiring dialysis has been shown to be even higher (EUR 17,706 on average) (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aggressive hydration and allopurinol, with or without urinary alkalinization with bicarbonate, is the standard prophylaxis for TLS. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which prevents the formation of uric acid but does not catabolise (so degrade and detoxify) existing uric acid. Allopurinol is therefore not an effective treatment for established TLS, since it does not promote uric acid clearance. Because of the inhibition of xanthine oxidase, allopurinol increases the level of uric acid precursors, hypoxanthine and xanthine. As xanthine is less soluble than uric acid, it may precipitate in renal tubules causing xanthine nephropathy (kidney disease) or xanthine stones (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>Urate oxidase is an alternative agent used for the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperuricaemia in people who are at high risk of TLS. Urate oxidase converts uric acid to allantoin, which is five to 10 times more soluble than uric acid and readily excreted in urine. A non-recombinant form of urate oxidase has been available in Europe for more than 20 years, but it is associated with acute hypersensitivity reactions in 4.5% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Yim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yim 2003</LINK>). Rasburicase, a relatively new, recombinant urate oxidase enzyme produced by a genetically modified <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> strain, has now replaced the older agent and is widely used. Reported advantages of urate oxidase over allopurinol include its ability to catabolise existing uric acid in established TLS; no increased risk of xanthine stone formation; no requirement for dose adjustment in acute renal failure; lack of clinically relevant drug-drug interaction; and lower incidence of adverse reactions, such as skin rash, fever, eosinophilia, and Stevens Johnson syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez_x002d_Macias-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez-Macias 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanofi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanofi 2011</LINK>). Anecdotal reports and case series have indicated that urate oxidase may be effective in the prevention and treatment of TLS (<LINK REF="REF-Bosly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coiffier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiffier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hummel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hummel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutcherson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutcherson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lascombes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lascombes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pui-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pui 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pui-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pui 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trifilio-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trifilio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>), resulting in a significant reduction of serum uric acid level and a low incidence of renal failure requiring dialysis. In addition, the use of urate oxidase has been reported to be cost-effective for the prevention and treatment of TLS in both children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003b</LINK>). However, it is not entirely certain whether the existing evidence is sufficiently rigorous to support the routine use of urate oxidase as prophylaxis in children with malignancies at risk of TLS, or as a treatment for established laboratory or clinical TLS. It is also uncertain whether single or multiple doses of urate oxidase should be used or which types of high-risk patients benefit most from prophylactic administration of urate oxidase. Although there are consensus guidelines developed for the management of TLS (<LINK REF="REF-Cairo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coiffier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiffier 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tosi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tosi 2008</LINK>), they did not include the latest evidence from systematic review. Therefore, we examined the efficacy and safety of urate oxidase in children with malignancies in a systematic review of RCTs and CCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Cheuk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheuk 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheuk-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheuk 2014</LINK>). This is the second update of that systematic review.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-07-03 07:10:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used risk ratio (RR) estimations with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We did not calculate a RR if there was only one study available for a particular outcome, and there was no event in one of the groups. We used the Fisher's exact test (performed using SPSS version 19 (<LINK REF="REF-SPSS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPSS 2010</LINK>)) to determine the P value in such situations. We used mean difference (MD) estimations with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We analysed all participants in the treatment groups to which they were allocated (intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses) if there were no missing data; we planned to perform per-protocol analyses if information for intention-to-treat analyses was lacking. We did not impute missing data. We planned to consider cost-effectiveness of interventions if relevant data were available.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-07-03 13:25:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We contacted the authors of included studies to ask them to supply missing data. We assessed missing data and dropouts/attrition for each included study and assessed and discussed the extent to which the missing data could alter the results/conclusions of the review.

<P>We planned to generate a funnel plot (effect size against standard error) if we found sufficient studies (more than five). Asymmetry could be due to publication bias, but could also be due to a relationship between trial size and effect size.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-02-23 11:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where the interventions were the same or similar enough, we synthesised results in a meta-analysis if there was no important clinical heterogeneity. If no significant statistical heterogeneity was present, we synthesised the data using a fixed-effect model. If there was unexplained heterogeneity, we used a random-effects model in the meta-analysis. We produced a 'Summary of findings' table for each comparison according to the recommendations in the <I>Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011a</LINK>), to summarise the results for the outcomes (incidence of clinical TLS, mortality due to TLS, renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, normalisation of serum uric acid, percentage reduction in serum uric acid level, AUC of serum uric acid level, and frequency of adverse events). We provided grading of the quality of evidence according to the GRADE system (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>) using the GRADE profiler software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2015</LINK>).

<P>If two or more included trials reported the same outcomes for the same subgroups, and no significant heterogeneity was present, we combined their results in meta-analyses. We assessed clinical heterogeneity by comparing the distribution of important participant factors between trials (age, type of malignancies) and trial factors (randomisation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, losses to follow-up, treatment regimens). We assessed statistical heterogeneity of RCTs by examining the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), a quantity that describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error.

<P>With the updated electronic search strategy on 26 February 2013, we retrieved 16 articles from CENTRAL, 53 articles from MEDLINE, 18 articles from Embase, and no articles from CINAHL. We found five studies from checking references of included studies and two studies from the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register. We identified no studies by scanning the conference proceedings and contacting experts. In summary, we found a total of 94 studies in the update search in February 2013. After we removed duplicates, we screened 81 articles for eligibility. We excluded 69 articles based on title or abstract. We obtained the full text of the remaining 12 articles.

<P>The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) comparing rasburicase with allopurinol included a total of 27 participants in the intervention group and 25 participants in the control group.

<P>This is the second update of the original systematic review. No new studies were included and conclusions did not change. Although numerous uncontrolled studies have found that urate oxidase can lower serum uric acid levels quickly and sometimes dramatically, we found little evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) supporting its effectiveness in preventing or treating tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in children with cancer. Only two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 2009</LINK>) and five CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>) were available on the prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome. There is currently no trial evaluating urate oxidase for treatment of established TLS.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Urate oxidase versus allopurinol</HEADING>
<P>Six included studies compared urate oxidase with allopurinol for the prevention of tumour lysis syndrome. One study was an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>), and the other five studies were CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>). One CCT (<LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>) reported the incidence of clinical TLS and did not find significant difference between the group that received Uricozyme and the group that received allopurinol. The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the group that received rasburicase and the group that received allopurinol. The pooled result of the three CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>) also showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the intervention and the control groups. The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) did not find any mortality due to TLS in either the intervention group or the control group. However, the pooled result of the three CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>) showed a significantly lower mortality due to TLS in the group that received Uricozyme compared with the group that received allopurinol. The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) showed no significant difference in the frequency of renal failure between the intervention and the control groups. In contrast, pooled results of five CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>) showed significantly lower frequency of renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy in participants who received urate oxidase compared with those who received allopurinol. However, heterogeneity was present in this analysis.</P>
<P>The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) showed significantly higher frequency of uric acid normalisation at four hours in the participants who received rasburicase compared with participants who received allopurinol. All included trials did not report the duration before normalisation of serum uric acid level. The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) reported a significantly lower AUC of serum uric acid at four days in the intervention group compared with the control group. Three CCTs reported serial uric acid levels (<LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>). All three CCTs reported results on the first two days after urate oxidase, while two studies (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>) reported results up to four days, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>) reported results up to 12 days. The pooled results showed significantly lower uric acid levels in the intervention group compared with the control group at two days, three days, four days, and seven days, but the differences were not significant at one day, five days, and 12 days. Heterogeneity was present in some of these analyses. The RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) and three CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>) reported frequency of adverse effects in the intervention and the control groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">High-dose versus low-dose urate oxidase</HEADING>
<P>We included one RCT that compared high-dose versus low-dose rasburicase (<LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 2009</LINK>). The trial did not report the incidence of TLS. The trial reported no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the high-dose and the low-dose groups. There was no mortality due to TLS in both the high-dose and the low-dose groups. There was no renal failure due to TLS in both groups. There was no significant difference in normalisation of uric acid level between the high-dose and the low-dose groups. The included RCT did not report the duration before normalisation of serum uric acid level or the AUC of serum uric acid level. The trial reported the percentage reduction of uric acid level at four hours and did not find significant difference between the two groups.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-25 12:41:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although urate oxidase is widely used in children with cancer for prevention of TLS, high-quality evidence of its efficacy is limited. The only RCT comparing urate oxidase with allopurinol (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>) did not report the important outcome of clinical TLS. Although participants who received rasburicase had significantly lower exposure to uric acid (lower AUC and higher chance of uric acid normalisation) compared with participants who received allopurinol in the RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>), we were not entirely certain whether this translated into significant clinical benefits. Although hyperuricaemia is related to TLS, this trial failed to show any significant difference between the treatment and the control groups in all-cause mortality or mortality related to TLS or renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Because of the paucity of evidence from RCTs, we also included CCTs in the current systematic review. However, all five CCTs identified were of unsatisfactory methodological quality. Although mortality due to TLS and incidence of renal failure were found to be significantly lower in participants who received urate oxidase, the conclusion from CCTs has to be treated with caution in view of high risk of biases.</P>
<P>On the other hand, due to inadequate sample size in the existing trials, the absence of significant clinical benefits of urate oxidase may be a false negative result. Therefore, we cannot ignore the potential benefits of urate oxidase in children with malignancy based on the current available evidence, especially in view of its probable effectiveness in reducing serum uric acid, which is an important surrogate outcome. Further trials of larger sample size are needed to clarify the role of urate oxidase. Assuming a mortality rate of 0.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003a</LINK>) and that urate oxidase is effective in reducing mortality by half, the number of people with cancer needed to treat to prevent one death is 223, and the sample size required to achieve a power of 80% in detecting a reduction in mortality at a 5% level of significance is estimated to be 856 people.</P>
<P>There was only one RCT comparing different doses of rasburicase (<LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 2009</LINK>). The results were consistent with previous uncontrolled studies and CCTs; comparing rasburicase at 0.15 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg showed a dramatic reduction in serum uric acid level in both arms. However, the RCT did not report the important outcome of incidence of clinical TLS, and this small trial was not adequately powered to address the other clinically important outcomes of mortality or renal failure. Although there was no significant difference in any of the outcomes between the two groups, we are not certain whether a higher and lower dose of rasburicase are really equivalent because of the small sample size. Likewise, there is uncertainly about whether the higher dose is associated with more adverse effects.</P>
<P>Although not eligible for inclusion in this review, there is a study that has addressed the cost-effectiveness of rasburicase (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2003b</LINK>). This study concluded that rasburicase was cost-effective for prevention of TLS in children, and rasburicase for the treatment of TLS in children was cost-saving. However, this conclusion was based on the assumption that rasburicase is 60% to 100% effective in the prevention of TLS, which was not in fact based on high-quality trial evidence. As the effectiveness of urate oxidase in the prevention or treatment of TLS has yet to be established, its cost-effectiveness remains uncertain.</P>

<P>Apart from limitations in the number of RCTs reporting clinically relevant outcomes and inadequate power to evaluate these outcomes, the trials included in the current review had a number of methodological flaws and were prone to bias. We considered none of the included studies to have low risk of bias in all aspects assessed. In both RCTs, the treatment and the control groups were not comparable at baseline, which cast doubt on the success of randomisation and increased the probability of confounding. One of the RCTs included did not report the random sequence generation or allocation concealment, which are important to minimise selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 2009</LINK>). The other RCT had more dropouts in the control arm than in the treatment arm, which might have caused attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2001</LINK>). None of the included RCTs attempted to blind the participants, physicians, or outcome assessors, which might have introduced performance and detection biases. Trial protocols were not available, and it was uncertain whether there was reporting bias in the RCTs.</P>
<P>In addition, all five CCTs included were also of unsatisfactory methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>). There was a high risk of selection bias as participants were not randomly allocated to treatment groups. Performance and detection biases were also likely as there was no blinding. Reporting bias was uncertain as trial protocols were not available. There was a high risk of attrition bas in one CCT, which had a lot of missing data (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>). The results from the four historical controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>) were prone to bias from the advancement of supportive care with time. The remaining CCT (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>) was actually a retrospective review of data from trials of chemotherapy protocols comparing different treatments from different study groups at different locations; therefore, it suffered from bias due to different practices in different centres. The intervention and comparison groups were not comparable at baseline in two studies, which might result in high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00e9_nyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rényi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00f6_ssmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wössmann 2003</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Patte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Patte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e1_nchez-Tatay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sánchez Tatay 2010</LINK>) did not report some important baseline characteristics, so comparability of the intervention and comparison groups was uncertain. None of the included CCTs took into consideration and adjusted for potential confounding factors in their analyses; hence, their results were susceptible to confounding by known and unknown factors.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the use of urate oxidase for prevention of TLS in children with cancer ranks from very low to low, because of high risk of bias in existing trials and imprecise results.</P>

<P>As far as we know, this is the only systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of urate oxidase for prevention and treatment of TLS in children with cancer. There was a review on TLS with targeted therapy and the role of rasburicase (<LINK REF="REF-Bose-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bose 2011</LINK>). The authors performed a search on MEDLINE in February 2011 and included RCTs, CCTs, and single-arm studies of rasburicase in both children and adults. That review had a similar conclusion to the current review, that although there was a wealth of evidence suggesting that rasburicase is effective in correcting hyperuricaemia, prospective trials showing that it improves hard outcomes, such as acute renal failure, need for dialysis, and mortality, are lacking. More randomised controlled trials evaluating clinically relevant outcomes are needed.</P>

<P>Thus far, the paucity of high-quality studies precludes firm recommendations. Although there is some low-quality evidence that urate oxidase might be more effective than allopurinol in reducing the frequency of hyperuricaemia and the exposure to high serum uric acid, it is still uncertain whether the routine use of urate oxidase is effective for the prevention or treatment of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), or a reduction in mortality or renal failure associated with TLS in children with cancer. The potential benefit of urate oxidase might be its effectiveness in reducing serum uric acid, which is an important surrogate outcome. It is unclear which type of urate oxidase (rasburicase or Uricozyme) is superior in terms of efficacy and what dosage regimen or treatment duration is optimal. On the other hand, urate oxidase may be associated with potential adverse effects, such as haemolysis or hypersensitivity. Clinicians who wish to use urate oxidase should weigh the potential benefits of reducing serum uric acid levels and the uncertain benefits in preventing renal failure or mortality from TLS against the potential risk of adverse effects.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-22 02:38:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a paucity of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of TLS in children with cancer. The existing trials are of small size and low methodological quality. Further high-quality RCTs of larger sample size are needed to assess the effectiveness of urate oxidase in children, especially high-risk patients who are more likely to benefit. High-risk patients can include those with high tumour burden or turn-over (such as high initial white blood cell counts for leukaemia, or Burkitt lymphoma, high-stage lymphoma, or lymphoma with bulky disease), and people with baseline hyperuricaemia, renal impairment, hypocalcaemia, or hypophosphataemia. Trials should assess patient-orientated outcomes, such as incidence of clinical TLS, mortality, or frequency of renal failure. Although blinding of participants and clinicians for comparison of intravenous urate oxidase and oral allopurinol is difficult, it can be attempted with the use of a double placebo, to minimise performance biases. The effectiveness and safety of different forms of urate oxidase in different dosage regimens should also be investigated further.</P>

<P>We used the mean difference for continuous outcomes instead of the weighted mean difference. We updated the 'Risk of bias' assessment according to the latest version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (version 5.1.0). We still reported outcomes with less than 70% of participants' data, but we considered them to be prone to bias. We did not calculate risk ratio if there was only one study available for a particular outcome and there was no event in one of the groups; we used the Fisher's exact test (performed using SPSS 19) to determine the P value in such situations. In the update 2013, we changed the unit of uric acid measurements to mg/dL, instead of micromol/L in the original review, as mg/dL appeared to be more widely used. In the update 2016, we included GRADE assessment and 'Summary of findings' table and updated risk of bias assessment.</P>
