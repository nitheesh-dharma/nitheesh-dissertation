<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-07 16:38:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Geri R Arthur">
<P>Injuries in the home are very common. Most of the injuries to older people and children under five occur at home. Many people are encouraged to alter their home to try and reduce injury and injury risk. Common alterations include the fitting of locks on cupboards, installing stair gates, improvement of lighting in halls and stairways, and the removal of trip hazards. The review found that there is insufficient evidence from studies to show that such changes reduce the number of injuries in the home but does not conclude that these interventions are ineffective. Home alterations need to be evaluated by larger and better designed studies which include injuries in their outcomes.</P>

<P>We found 28 published studies and one unpublished study. Only two studies were sufficiently similar to allow pooling of data for statistical analyses. Studies were divided into three groups; children, older people and the general population/mixed age group. None of the studies focusing on children or older people demonstrated a reduction in injuries that were a direct result of environmental modification in the home. One study in older people demonstrated a reduction in falls and one a reduction in falls and injurious falls that may have been due to hazard reduction. One meta-analysis was performed which examined the effects on falls of multifactorial interventions consisting of home hazard assessment and modification, medication review, health and bone assessment and exercise (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-07 15:20:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Geri R Arthur">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether interventions focused on modifying environmental home hazards reduce injuries. Further interventions to reduce hazards in the home should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes. Recruitment of large study samples to measure effect must be a major consideration for future trials. Researchers should also consider using factorial designs to allow the evaluation of individual components of multifactorial interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-01 19:20:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Injury in the home environment is an extremely common event, accounting for around a third of injuries in all age groups. The majority of injuries of children under five and people aged 75 and over occur in the home (<LINK REF="REF-DTI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">DTI 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lilley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyons-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 2002</LINK>). A European Union report (<LINK REF="REF-EU-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EU 2006</LINK>) describes injury as the number one killer of children, adolescents and young adults; a major cause of disability, morbidity and healthcare costs; as detrimental to European Union production and unequal in its impact on social groups. The report cites children, adolescents and the elderly as priority groups for addressing safety issues. The World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>) estimated that within its Member States, 875,000 children and adolescents under the age of 18 died each year due to injury and approximately 70% of these deaths were due to accidental injury. One study reported that up to 44% of accidental injuries occur in the home (<LINK REF="REF-Scheidt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheidt 1995</LINK>). It is unclear what proportion of these injuries are caused by hazards in the home. There is evidence from certain reviews to suggest that it is possible to reduce injuries in the home by using multifactorial, injury prevention interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Health-Development-Agency-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Development Agency 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Towner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Haastregt-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Haastregt 2000a</LINK>). Subsequently, this evidence has found its way into policy documents and strategies prepared to prevent injuries in the home.</P>
<P>In England, the National Service Framework for Older People sets as a standard the development of an integrated falls prevention service in every acute hospital (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2001</LINK>). National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>) states that all older people who experience recurrent falls or are at risk of falling should be considered for an individualised multifactorial intervention. This advice was based on non-experimental, descriptive studies. This message was reiterated recently in UK government guidance to reduce falls and fractures with early intervention paramount (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2009</LINK>). Research which examined the views of older people towards fall prevention strategies highlighted that interventions perceived as overbearing or restrictive were not popular and advice to be constantly vigilant for fall hazards could be disempowering (<LINK REF="REF-Yardley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yardley 2005</LINK>). Older people favoured positive messages about benefits of interventions and the opportunity to choose strategies that suited them.</P>
<P>In setting up such services, a balance needs to be struck between the amount of resource spent on reducing intrinsic risk factors for falls (for example, excess or inappropriate medication, visual and balance problems) and extrinsic factors (for example, presence of environmental hazards). There appears to be a lack of similar guidelines in relation to injury prevention for children, although some guidance is currently being formulated, notably by NICE in the UK. This may reflect the lack of good quality scientific evidence available.</P>
<P>Existing reviews, however, have looked at any interventions that prevent falls and injuries and have not determined the relative importance of tackling intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The aim of this review, therefore, was to determine whether modification of the home environment reduces injuries in the home. It is hoped that the results of the review may inform and alert clinicians, practitioners and the public to gaps in the evidence and provide suggestions for the testing of future interventions. In addition, the conclusions will guide the research and policy development communities and government departments engaged in policy development. This is particularly important, given the development of cross-disciplinary collaboration in the field of injury prevention and because government policy, strategy and implementation documents should now directly reflect the results of research evidence.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-10-01 19:20:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>To determine the effect of modifications to the home environment on the reduction of injuries, with the primary focus being interventions which reduce physical hazards in the home. </P>
<P>This review does not include interventions to promote smoke alarm ownership and function. These are the focus of an existing Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-DiGuiseppi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGuiseppi 2001</LINK>); interventions to prevent injuries caused by items brought into the home such as household chemicals and firearms; home-based items unrelated to building structure such as hip protectors for the elderly, also the subject of an existing Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2005</LINK>); medicines, bottles or toys; or injuries related to chronic exposures such as environmental lead.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-01 19:20:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Eligible interventions are those which focus on modifying physical hazards including the building fabric or 'fixtures and fittings' (that is, removable items within a property that are fastened or attached to the building fabric) in the domestic environment, and where modifications such as the installation of grab rails, stair gates, fireguards, cupboard locks, hot-water tap adaptations and lighting adjustments, have been included. </P>
<P>We have included interventions which take a multifactorial approach (that is, have modification plus education or action on other risk factors). We have included studies which include the installation of smoke alarms alongside other physical interventions but not those where provision of smoke alarms was the sole intervention.</P>
<P>We excluded interventions which did not focus on reducing acute physical injuries (for example studies reducing chronic exposure to lead or nitrogen dioxide). We excluded any intervention where the focus has been to change the home environment solely for non-injury benefits (for example, improved quality of life of disabled individuals).</P>

<P>Two authors pre-screened all abstracts for relevance, duplication, outcome and design. An expert assessor independently reviewed all abstracts considered not eligible. Where it was not possible to determine if a study met the inclusion/exclusion criteria on the basis of the title and/or abstract alone, we retrieved the full reference and two authors assessed the study according to the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-09-29 17:59:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eligible studies were separated into three categories for the purposes of data extraction: a) older people, b) children and c) the general population. Two expert authors independently extracted data from each study. We used EPOC (data collection checklists) guidelines for methodological quality for quality checking and assessed inter-rater reliability by the kappa statistic. The kappa statistic for the older people category was 1 in the original review, 0.93 in the last update and 0.85 in the current update. It was 0.95 between raters for groups b) children and c) the general population in the original review, 1 in the update and 1 in the current update. We resolved any disagreements on data extraction by consensus discussion, following review by a third assessor.</P>

<P>We considered allocation concealment to be adequate if the randomisation process was protected before and until allocation of treatment group (e.g. use of sealed opaque envelopes). Where a study reported randomisation, but did not describe the method of randomisation, or we judged the method described inadequate, we then deemed it to be a controlled clinical trial (CCT) and excluded it. We also assessed blinding of outcome assessment, method of analysis (e.g. Intention-To-Treat versus Per Protocol analysis), attrition rate and statistical power as indicators of study quality.</P>

<P>In the initial searches performed up to December 2004, we identified 44,717 unique citations through our electronic database searches. A stepped exclusion exercise was performed where references were excluded on the basis of title or title and abstract based on the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Where it was not possible to confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria on review of the abstract alone, we retrieved the full reference. At this stage, we identified 128 potentially relevant references. We identified three more studies through personal contact (<LINK REF="REF-Elkan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK>) and 13 additional citations by checking the reference lists of reviews (including one review article (<LINK REF="REF-Purdue-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purdue 2003</LINK>) which identified no new citations).

One was a German-language paper that was found not to meet the inclusion criteria when it was translated. In another the environmental intervention was not taken up. Four studies were interrupted-time series studies that did not have a sufficient number of gathering points to meet the EPOC guidelines. One was a non-controlled before-and-after study, three were controlled before-and-after studies with no allocation concealment, one a PRECEDE-PROCEED model with different subjects and methods (<LINK REF="STD-Durongritichai-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Durongritichai 2003</LINK>).

<P>The adequacy of allocation concealment was evaluated for all studies using the EPOC checklist for RCTs. Where a study reported randomisation but did not describe the method of randomisation, or the method described was judged inadequate, it was then deemed to be a controlled clinical trial (CCT) and was excluded. <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2000</LINK> argues that studies have shown that methodologically weak RCTs and inadequately reported RCTs yield biased results. Their earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) of 250 controlled trials from 33 meta-analyses in pregnancy and childbirth found that RCTs with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment gave larger estimates of treatment effects, 41% and 33% respectively on average, than trials which reported adequate concealment. Similar results were found for trials in digestive diseases, circulatory diseases, mental health, and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).They found that trials that used inadequate or unclear allocation concealment gave on average 37% larger estimates of effect, than those using adequate concealment.</P>

<P>Nine studies had sufficient statistical power to detect important effects as statistically significant and recorded power (<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>). Two studies appeared slightly underpowered. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK>) the power calculation was stated as requiring a sample size of 1143 and achieved a sample size of 1107 and in another (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2005</LINK>), a sample size of 80 mothers was required and 78 was achieved. In three it was reported that the study was underpowered. <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2007</LINK> stated that their study was underpowered to detect injury outcomes and was limited to examining trends. Similarly another study (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>) was underpowered to detect a significant difference due to a lower than expected number of hip fractures. <LINK REF="STD-Pardessus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pardessus 2002</LINK> did not report a power calculation but concluded that the number of participants in their study (n = 60) was perhaps too small to detect a significant difference between the intervention and control in terms of rate of falls. <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK> reported that they had carried out power calculations but did not state the number required to achieve this.</P>
<P>One study had large losses to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Sangvai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sangvai 2007</LINK>), thus results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessment was stated in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangvai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sangvai 2007</LINK>).

<P>Many of the studies involved multifactorial interventions: that is the intervention consisted of multiple components, not just a single intervention. In 11 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hogan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pardessus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pardessus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Haastregt-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Van Haastregt 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1992</LINK>), no significant effect of the intervention on falls was found. In <LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK>, the proportion of participants who reported falling did not differ significantly between the control group (CG) and either of the intervention groups (IG): brief intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.1) and intensive intervention (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.4). <LINK REF="STD-Hogan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hogan 2001</LINK> combined a home visit to record hazards and falls prevention classes, and found no significant differences between the CG and IG in the cumulative number of falls (311 versus 241, P = 0.34), having one or more falls (79.2% versus 72.0%, P = 0.30) or in the mean number of falls (4.0 versus 3.2, P = 0.43).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Pardessus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pardessus 2002</LINK>, a home visit was performed post hospitalisation for a fall. The main intervention was the identification of environmental hazards and the recommendation of home modifications. Social support mechanisms were also addressed. There was no significant difference in fall recurrence between the IG and CG (mean number of fall recurrences IG 0.68 ± 0.16 vs CG 0.82 ± 0.16). However the study may have been underpowered to detect an effect. <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK> was a multifactorial intervention where intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference between IG and CG in proportion of patients who fell during one year of follow up (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05). <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK>, which combined a home visit to assess hazards, free safety devices and an educational strategy, found that there was no significant reduction in the IG in the incidence rates of falls involving environmental hazards inside the home (adjusted rate ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.50) or the rate of falls inside the home (adjusted rate ratio 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Van-Haastregt-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Van Haastregt 2000b</LINK> reported no effect in the IG for those who experienced at least one fall (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.1) while <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1992</LINK> found that more falls without fracture occurred in the IG (23% versus 16%, no CI stated), although it is unclear if this is statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>'s programme of falls and fracture risk assessment and referral to appropriate community interventions, such as an exercise programme, was not significant in reducing falls in older people (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.96, CI 95% 0.70 to1.34). The authors suggested that low adherence to programme components and possible internal contamination may have reduced the effectiveness of this study. In addition, the study authors speculate whether multifactorial studies lessen the effectiveness of the individual components.</P>
<P>The multifactorial fall prevention programme in <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK> was based on an earlier programme carried out in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Close-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Close 1999</LINK>). However, unlike the UK study, which found favourable effects on the number of people experiencing a fall, the <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK> study carried out in the Netherlands, found no effect on falls (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.49). The study authors gave several possible explanations for this, including the suggestion that the extended implementation period of the fall prevention programme, in a Dutch healthcare as opposed to a UK healthcare setting, may have reduced the effectiveness of this programme.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2007</LINK>'s results demonstrated that a multifactorial model with referrals to existing medical care and services supported with monthly follow-up calls to encourage adherence, did not decrease falls in community dwelling older adults (RR 0.81, P = 0.27). However, nursing home days were fewer in the IG (10.3 versus 20.5 days, P = 0.04). The study authors suggest their intermediate-intensity model, which relied on recommendations and referrals, may not provide enough direct intervention to be effective.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>'s multifactorial fall prevention programme, which was based on individual risk analysis, did not reduce the incidence of falls in community dwelling older people with at least one previous fall, during a 12-month follow-up (IRR 0.92, 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.19). However, in subgroup analysis, significant interactions between subgroups and groups, both in the IG and CG, were found for persons with depressive symptoms (P = 0.006), number of falls during previous 12 months (P = 0.003) and self-perceived risk of falling (P = 0.045). The authors present several explanations for their results, including opportunistic recruitment; non-stringent inclusion criteria; and the possibility that their study may have been underpowered to detect a reduction in the incidence of falls.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>) were considered sufficiently methodologically and statistically homogenous to undertake a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Both studies included a multifactorial fall prevention intervention. The interventions comprised: home hazard assessment and modification; medication review and health and bone assessment; and exercise programme. Inclusion criteria and outcome assessment were also considered comparable and both control groups received basic guidance on fall prevention. Combining data from these two studies showed that a multifactorial fall prevention programme designed for older people who had fallen in the previous 12 months did not reduce the risk of falling (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23).</P>
<P>In other multifactorial studies (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tinetti 1994</LINK>), although a significant reduction in falls was reported, the effect of environmental modifications was impossible to separate from other interventions. Although <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK> reported the incidence density rate of falls per 1000 resident years was 2558 for the CG and 1399 for the IG, (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73), this was a multifactorial intervention targeting falls in nursing homes. The authors agreed on a list of environmental hazard removal and prosthetic supports but admitted that the lack of validated scoring system for environmental factors as well as time differences for corrections, made the reporting of adherence to environmental corrections unfeasible. Thus any contribution of home modification to the intervention effect was impossible to quantify. Additionally, it was argued that seeing the effects of environmental adaptations, such as installing new floor surfaces, would take more time than allowed in the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK> was a multifactorial fall prevention programme including staff education, environmental adjustment, exercise, medication review, aids, hip protectors and post fall problem-solving conferences. Their intervention significantly reduced the number of residents who fell (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96), total number of falls (IRR 0.60 95% CI 0.5 to 0.73) adjusted for baseline factors), time to first fall (adjusted hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.79) and number of femoral fractures (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.94). In <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>'s study the interventions included modification to the home environment and training in the use of mobility and technical aids. The IG had 31% fewer falls than the CG (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97). The intervention was most effective in a subgroup of participants who reported having had two or more falls during the year before recruitment into the study.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tinetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tinetti 1994</LINK>, the adjusted IRR for falling in the IG compared with the CG was 0.69 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.90).</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cumming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumming 1999</LINK>), a reduction in falls was observed in an intervention subgroup only, participants with a history of falls (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK>, the percentage estimated reduction in annual fall rate attributed to home hazard management was not significant (3.1%, 95% CI -2.0 to 9.7). However, there was a significant effect when the intervention included exercise (9.9%, 95% CI 2.4 to 17.9). The strongest effect was observed when all three interventions; exercise, home hazard management, vision correction, were combined together (14.0%, 95% CI 3.7 to 22.6), (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88). The study authors propose that the intervention may not have been intensive enough or the modifications may not have been sufficient or the right type to affect falls outcome.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>'s study focused on older people with severe visual impairment. Due to the factorial design, each component of the study could be evaluated separately. They found that fewer falls occurred in the group randomised to receive only the home safety programme, compared to the social visits group (IRR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.62).</P>
<P>There were no included studies which had falls data as an outcome measure in children or general population categories.</P>

<P>There were 13 studies which included older people (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Close-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Close 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Haastregt-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Van Haastregt 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1992</LINK>) and reported injuries data, 11 of which found no significant reduction in the IG. In <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>, no significant difference in hip fractures between the IG and CG (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.51) was reported. There was also no significant difference between the incidence density rate of non-hip fractures between the IG and the CG (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.07). Similarly in <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK>, the RR between the IG and CG was not significantly different for major injuries (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.00) or fractured neck of femurs (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.72). However in all of these studies the numbers of injuries were small. <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> was not designed to examine fall-related injuries and stated that numbers were too small for statistical comparisons. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK> found no significant reduction in the rate of injurious falls in the IG (adjusted RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.14). <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1992</LINK> reported a similar proportion of fractures in both the IG and CG (5% versus 4%, no CI stated). <LINK REF="STD-Van-Haastregt-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Van Haastregt 2000b</LINK> reported OR 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.6) for injurious falls in the IG compared to the CG.</P>
<P>Five further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Close-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Close 1999</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>) found no significant reduction in the number of injurious falls or fracture rates. <LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK> found the proportion of participants who reported one or more falls requiring medical attention did not differ significantly between CG and either of the IGs: brief intervention (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.2) and intensive intervention (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.4). <LINK REF="STD-Close-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Close 1999</LINK> found no significant reductions in the percentage of patients reporting serious injury from falls (CG 8% versus IG 4%, P = 0.26). <LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK> reported no significant reduction in moderate injurious falls (IG 1.05 injurious falls per person-year vs CG 1.00, no CI stated) or serious injurious falls (IG 0.09 injurious falls per person-year vs CG 0.05, no CI stated). The study authors speculate whether multifactorial trials lessen the effectiveness of the individual components. <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>'s study reported no significant reduction in injurious falls between IG and CG (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.73, P = 0.53). <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>'s intervention did not reduce the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment at 12 months' follow-up (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.69) or at three years follow-up (IRR 0.87, 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.21).</P>
<P>The picture is only a little different in <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>. Although the authors report a reduction in injurious falls in the IG, no statistical comparison is reported. However, a significant reduction in femoral fractures is recorded, with only three residents in the IG suffering a femoral fracture compared to 12 in the CG (adjusted OR = 0.23, CI 0.06 to 0.94). In a later report, <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2003</LINK> analysed the effect of this intervention in older people with differing levels of cognitive function. Fifty-nine minor, moderate or serious injuries occurred in the higher cognitive group, giving a non-significant crude IRR 0.90 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.50) compared with the control group and similarly in the lower cognitive group (crude IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.30). However in the lower cognitive group the 171 participants sustained 10 femoral fractures, all of which were in the control group (result expressed as P = 0.006).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>'s study, which focused on older people with visual acuity problems, a significant reduction in injurious falls was reported in the home safety programme only group versus social visits group (IRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87).</P>

Four of these studies found no significant difference in injury occurrence between IG and CG. <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK> reported no significant change in the frequency of at least one medically attended injury (OR 0.97 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30), at least one attendance at an accident and emergency department for injury (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37), at least one primary care attendance for injury (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.17) or at least one hospital admission for injury (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.12). <LINK REF="STD-Sangvai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sangvai 2007</LINK>'s multifactorial intervention showed no significant difference in medically attended injuries (19/160 IG and 22/159 CG). <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK> reported a higher attendance rate for injury in primary care in the IG compared to the CG (IRR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.70, P = 0.003). Treatment arms did not differ significantly for other injury outcomes. Finally in <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2007</LINK> injury rates did not differ between the group provided with a safety kit and the CG (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.18), or the safety kit plus home visit group and CG (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.21).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK>'s study showed a significant reduction in injury visits per patient at 12 months in the IG (RR 0.69, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.88).

<P>Eight included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cumming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumming 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK>) reported data on hazard reduction in older people. All eight studies found a greater reduction in hazards in the IG compared to the CG, but only two studies reported a significant reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK>). Five studies did not report whether their result were statistically significant, and <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>'s results appeared non-effective. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cumming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumming 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>) had an associated reduction in falls. In one other study (<LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK>), the reduction in falls could not be directly associated with the reduction in hazards.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>, 222 home modifications were recommended. A minimum of one recommended change was implemented by 137 homes (75.7%). The most commonly recommended changes were elevation of the toilet seat in 43 homes, use of a rollator (walking frame with wheels) in 37 homes and fixing grab rails in the bathroom in 27 homes. Compliance with recommendations ranged from 33.3% to 82.6% at 12 months' follow-up. Participants who made at least one of the recommendations experienced a significant reduction in the rate of falls (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99, P = 0.047) at 12 months' follow up. The number of falls in participants in the IG with no home modifications was not significantly different from those in the CG (IRR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.41). Therefore an intention-to-treat analysis would be likely to report no difference between the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Cumming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumming 1999</LINK> observed a reduction in hazards in the IG but it is unclear if this was a significant reduction and falls were only reduced in the intervention sub-group with a history of falls (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83). In <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>, 85% of participants in the home safety group were followed up at six months (169/198), and 90% of these (152/169) were reported as complying partially or completely with one or more of the home safety recommendations made by the occupational therapist, implying that the intervention was acceptable.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK> observed a positive effect on making changes to improve home safety in both IGs with 35% in the brief intervention group and 49% in the intensive IG making changes in the home to improve safety, compared to 28% in the CG at 12 months' follow-up. No test for statistical significance was reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK> there was no significant change in environmental risk factors score at three months in either the IG or CG, but there was a significant change in score between the two groups, P &lt; 0.001. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK> reported statistically significant improvements in a sample (n = 51) of the larger study in: unsafe steps (Mean 0.61, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.94), stabilisation of rugs and mats (Mean 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.24), rooms with trailing cords (Mean 0.43, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76) and rooms with unsafe favourite chair (Mean 0.10 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18). Whilst the authors reported other results as significant, no statistical significance tests were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK> reported that of the 543 participants receiving the home hazard management intervention, 478 were advised to have modifications to their homes. Help to carry out modifications was received by 363 participants which included 275 hand rails fitted, 72 modifications to floor coverings and 72 homes receiving contrast edging to steps. Modification of environmental hazards on their own did not reduce injuries but the strongest effect was found when all three interventions (exercise, medical review and home modification) were combined (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>'s study, the effect of their intervention on environmental home hazards at 12 months was reported as a difference of adjusted means of -1.38, 95% CI -3.17 to 0.41, P = 0.13, which is not statistically significant.</P>

In addition, significantly more families in the IG showed safe practice for windows (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.58), fireplaces (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.54) and door-slam safety (RR 7.00, 95% CI 3.15 to 15.6). <LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK> found a significant reduction in the prevalence of homes with hot water above 54°C; (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.50) and the presence of a fire extinguisher (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97) in the IGs (<LINK REF="REF-King-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2001</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Posner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2004</LINK>), the IG received comprehensive home safety education and free safety devices and the CG received a focused injury-specific emergency department discharge set of instructions. The IG demonstrated significantly higher average overall safety scores than the CG (73.3%, SD 8.4%, P &#8806; 0.002), and significant improvements in prevention of the following hazards: poison (74.4%, SD 19.5, P &#8806; 0.02), cut/piercing (81%, SD 18.2, P &#8806; 0.001) and burn category scores (76.0%, SD 14.9, P = 0.03). Caregivers in the IG also demonstrated greater improvement in reported use of the distributed safety devices (65.4%, SD 20.5, P &#8806; 0.001).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2007</LINK>, parents in both IG (home visit plus safety kit and just safety kit) were more likely to report having hot water at a safe temperature than CG participants: safety kit alone (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.69); and safety kit plus home visit (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.46), both adjusted for income and baseline measure of dependent values. Parents receiving the safety kit plus home visit were also more likely to report having used the hot water temperature-testing card than those receiving the safety kit alone (OR 2.38, CI 1.42 to 3.97, adjusted for income), and compared to the CG, were more likely to report having plants placed out of reach of children (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.52, adjusted for income and baseline measure of dependent values), as some houseplants are toxic.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2005</LINK> a statistically significant difference was found in controllable safety hazard scores between groups (F(1.77) 99.6, P &#8806; 0.01). In <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>, at both one-year and two-year follow-up, families in the IG were significantly more likely to have implemented a range of safety practices. At 12 months' follow-up the IG were significantly more likely to be safe in terms of smoke alarms (OR 1.83, CI 1.33 to 2.52, P = 0.0002), stairs (OR 1.46, CI 1.19 to 1.80, P = 0.0004), windows (OR 1.28, CI 1.02 to 1.59, P = 0.03), storage of cleaning products (OR 1.34, CI 1.09 to 1.66, P = 0.006) and sharp objects (OR 1.34, CI 1.09 to 1.65, P = 0.005) in the kitchen than families in the CG. At 24 months' follow-up, families in the IG were also significantly more likely to be safe in terms of smoke alarms (OR 1.67, CI 1.21 to 2.32, P = 0.002), storage of medicines (OR 1.55, CI 1.00 to 2.40, P = 0.05), and cleaning products (OR 1.31, CI 1.07 to 1.60, P = 0.008) in the kitchen than families in the CG. However, absolute differences in the percentages of families with safety practices were small. For example in the case of fitted window locks, 71.7% of families in the IG were reported as having locks at follow-up compared to 66.5% in the CG.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Sangvai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sangvai 2007</LINK>, smoke detectors were functional in 16 of 17 intervention households compared with five of 10 control households (P = 0.015, fisher exact test), and hazardous substances were not found in low cabinets of 13 of 16 intervention households compared to three of 10 control households (P = 0.015, fishers exact test).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-20 09:55:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is logical to presume that the presence of environmental risk factors must play some part in the cause of injuries in the home. However, despite the inclusion of 29 randomised trials, the findings of this review suggest that there is little high-level scientific evidence for modification of the built home environment as a method of reducing the risk of injury. It should be remembered that only some home injuries are due to environmental hazards and that removal of such hazards or provision of safety equipment can only influence the occurrence or severity of these particular injuries. As most studies reported <I>all</I> injuries as their outcome, this will have the effect of reducing the power to detect changes in falls and injuries due to environmental hazards. Most studies did not provide enough detail in their results to ascertain the mechanism of injuries, probably as such information was not available to them and is difficult to systematically collect from participants or routine data sources.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of the main findings</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen of the studies in the older people group reported injuries as an outcome. However, only two of these studies reported a significant reduction in injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK> reported significantly fewer injurious falls in the intervention group (IG) compared to the control group (CG) (IRR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.62) and <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>'s study found a significant reduction in femoral fractures in the IG (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.94) but no reductions in falls that resulted in minor or moderate injuries. <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK> used a 2×2 factorial study design, and specifically targeted interventions towards older people with severe visual impairment, which may mean the results from this study are not generalisable to other populations. The home safety intervention was delivered by an occupational therapist and included a home safety assessment and modifications to the home environment if indicated. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>'s study was set in a residential care facility in Sweden, and used an 11-week multifactorial programme which included general and individualised strategies focusing on: educating staff; modifying the environment; implementing exercise programmes; medication reviews and providing free hip protectors. <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>'s factorial study design allowed the home safety programme to be evaluated in isolation and potentially permits a direct link to be made between the home safety programme and subsequent reduction in injuries. This is not possible in <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>'s study due to their multifactorial study design. <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK> also stresses that no femoral fractures occurred in residents wearing hip protectors and suggest that their use may have contributed towards this result. When comparing results across studies, it should be considered that hazard prevalence and other risk factors for having a fall or injury vary by setting and hence variation in effect sizes of interventions is to be expected.</P>
<P>Out of the nine studies involving children, five reported injuries as an outcome. Only one of these studies reported significantly fewer self-reported injuries in the IG (<LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK>) at 12 months' follow-up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88) and a borderline result at 36 months' follow-up (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00). None of the studies involving children reported a significant reduction in medically attended injuries. <LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK>'s study was aimed at children under eight years old, and intervention participants received a single home visit that included an information pack, discount coupons, and specific instructions regarding home safety measures. Interestingly, out of the 16 safety modifications, only hot water temperature was shown to be significantly lower in the intervention households (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.50).</P>
<P>In an earlier report (<LINK REF="REF-King-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2001</LINK>), the actual observation of hazard changes was at variance with the self-reported adoption of safety precautions. The authors conclude that it is unlikely that the intervention had an impact on the adoption of home safety measures and that other effects of the intervention, such as behavioural changes, might explain the reduction in injuries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key themes and relevance of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Although the focus of this systematic review is on the prevention of injuries by modifications of the home environment, most of the studies focusing on older people used the incidence of falls rather than the rate of injuries as their main outcome measure. Although the majority of fractures in older people follow a fall, only around one in 20 falls leads to a fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Rubenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenstein 2001</LINK>). A reduction in the proportion of people in an IG suffering a fall should lead to a similar reduction in the proportion suffering a fracture, but the absolute number of fractures prevented will be much smaller.</P>
<P>Studies using fracture incidence as their endpoint would need to be very much larger in scale, and this explains the literature's focus on fall prevention. There is no doubt that falls and the fear of falling are significant public health problems in themselves, but one cannot automatically assume that success in a falls prevention strategy will necessarily be reflected in reduced rates of injuries or fractures.</P>
<P>Additionally the vast majority of these studies were multifactorial and the effect of home modification on falls was either inseparable or insignificant. However this is a problem posed by the fact that falls, injuries or fractures in older people are commonly multifactorial in origin. A child may suffer a fracture that reflects the severity of the trauma, but over 95% of fractures in older people occur after only minor or moderate trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1999</LINK>). Factors underlying the causes of falls or the reduced ability to react and cushion the impact, and those affecting bone fragility are all relevant to the occurrence of injuries in older people.</P>
<P>Environmental modification cannot address all of these factors and injury prevention studies in older people therefore tend to be multifactorial in nature. This makes it more difficult to distinguish the contribution of environmental modification to the effectiveness of any strategy. An example of this is <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> who found 31% fewer falls in the IG than in the CG however the intervention also included training in the use of technical and mobility aids. However, participants who made at least one of the home modifications at 12 months' follow-up did experience a significant reduction in the rate of falls (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99, P = 0.047). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK> used a rigorous factorial design where the separate and combined effects of exercise training, vision improvement and house hazards management on falls could be assessed. Although the study reported non-significant reductions in falls following home hazard management as a sole intervention, when combined with both of the other interventions positive additive effects were reported. However, the beneficial effects were only significant when the combination of interventions contained an exercise component.</P>
<P>Studies in this review tended to be conducted in areas, countries or settings where the major environmental hazards have already been removed. Studies in low and/or middle income countries (LMICs) were largely absent from the literature and this may reflect issues in funding this type of study in these settings. Our selection criteria, which excluded housing which was not subject to housing regulations, also meant that studies conducted in potentially more hazardous environments were unlikely to be included. Given this, only modest changes may be possible in settings where the major environmental hazards have already been removed. Furthermore the fact that only a proportion of <I>all</I> falls or injuries can be addressed by additional environmental changes means that many studies which were powered to detect changes in <I>all</I> falls or injuries suffer from low statistical power when the outcome of interest is falls or injuries associated with hazards. Most trials with the prevention of injuries as an outcome require large numbers using <I>all injuries</I> as an outcome and it may not be feasible to fund or implement adequately powered studies to detect modest changes in injuries due to modification of specific environmental hazards.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>'s study was the only study to demonstrate a direct association between the home safety component of the intervention and a significant reduction in falls. However, the authors reported that there was no significant difference between falls occurring inside and outside the home, where the home modification intervention could not have influenced the risk of falling. This result has also been reported in other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cumming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumming 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>) and led <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK> to suggest that the reduction in falls may have been due to a combination of the occupational therapist's fall prevention advice as well as the environmental modifications in the home.</P>
<P>A number of studies involving older people reported a reduction in home hazards which did not translate into a reduction in falls or injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Carter unpublished</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2001</LINK>). Further, several studies reported no significant reduction in injuries, falls or hazards (<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hogan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pardessus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pardessus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Haastregt-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Van Haastregt 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1992</LINK>). The authors suggest several possible explanations for the ineffectiveness of their studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2007</LINK> speculated that low intensity interventions which rely upon recommendations and referrals may be too indirect to be effective, but that financial constraints may prevent the successful implementation of higher intensity fall prevention programmes. <LINK REF="STD-Mahoney-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahoney 2007</LINK>'s study demonstrated that telephone follow-up alone is not necessarily efficacious in increasing the effectiveness of an intermediate multifactorial study based upon recommendations and referrals.</P>
<P>There is also a debate as to whether multiple or single factor fall prevention programmes are more effective. Although meta-analyses have shown that multifactorial fall prevention programmes reduce the number of falls (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2007</LINK>), a recent meta-analysis found that the number of people having at least one fall did not reduce significantly in multifactorial interventions and that the benefit of multifactorial programmes may be less than first thought (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2007</LINK>). In addition, a meta-analysis of two studies carried out in our review found a multifactorial fall prevention intervention including home assessment and modification, medication review and health and bone assessment, and an exercise programme to be ineffective at reducing falls in older people (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23). Many authors have proposed that multiple component interventions may act to lessen the impact of their individual components (<LINK REF="STD-Elley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Elley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK>) and <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2007</LINK> has shown that multifactorial programmes may lead to lower adherence rates in some part or parts of the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK> found that participants who received a combined intervention of home safety and exercise were more likely to fall or suffer an injurious fall than those who received only the home safety programme. The fall rate was also found to be greater in participants who received the exercise programme compared to the CG, albeit not significantly. The results of this study are in stark contrast to the results of <LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK> which found the exercise component of their factorial study to be the most effective at reducing falls. <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK> concluded that although the Otago exercise programme has been shown to be successful in other populations (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2001a</LINK>), in a population of older people with severe visual impairment, the programme may be unsuitable and potentially harmful.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK>'s study highlighted the potential impact a different health care setting can have on the outcomes of a fall prevention programme. <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK> based their programme on a multifactorial fall prevention study that had been carried out in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Close-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Close 1999</LINK>). However, unlike the UK study which found the programme to have significantly beneficial effects on the number of participants experiencing a fall (<LINK REF="STD-Close-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Close 1999</LINK>), the <LINK REF="STD-Hendriks-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hendriks 2008</LINK> study, which was carried out in a Dutch healthcare setting, reported no statistically significant effect on falls. Although the authors provide several possible theories for the ineffectiveness of their study, they emphasise that the adaptations to the protocol which were required to implement the programme into the Dutch healthcare setting may have been one of the main causes. By introducing two new professional disciplines into the study (rehabilitation physician and geriatric nurse) and by involving GPs, the implementation period was extended by approximately 3.5 months. The study authors suggest that the extended time period between fall and completion of the intervention, may have reduced the efficacy of the programme in this healthcare setting.</P>
<P>It is also possible that a number of the multifactorial studies were underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference. An earlier meta-analysis suggested that a 30% relative reduction in falls was an attainable result for a multifactorial fall prevention programme (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2004</LINK>). However a more recent meta-analysis reported that a smaller relative reduction, approximately 10 percent, might be expected (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2007</LINK>). A number of studies including <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2009</LINK> calculated their sample size based on a 30% difference and therefore these studies may have been underpowered to detect a 10% reduction in falls.</P>
<P>Nonetheless multifactorial fall prevention programmes have demonstrated positive results. One of the first successful fall prevention studies used a multifactorial design (<LINK REF="STD-Tinetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tinetti 1994</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>, a multifactorial study set in a residential care home, reported significant reductions in falls and femoral fractures in the IG.</P>
<P>Overall there were nine included studies involving children (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sangvai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sangvai 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK> reported a significant reduction in self-reported injuries in the IG, they found that a single home visit was insufficient to encourage a lasting adoption of home safety measures. <LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK> concluded that a successful home visitation programme may require several home visits in order to develop a more therapeutic relationship with the participant, so that wider issues which may affect a child's safety can be addressed. <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK> unexpectedly found a significant increase in primary care attendances in the IG, even though the prevalence of safety practices in this group was significantly increased compared to the CG. As well as proposing possible explanations for this result, <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>'s study highlights the difficulties in demonstrating a reduction in injuries using RCT's. As the prevalence of safety features is high and the incidence of injuries that could be prevented from these safety features is low, very large sample sizes are usually required. One alternative offered by <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>'s study is to conduct well designed case-control or cohort studies to examine the effect of safety equipment followed by RCTs to investigate strategies for the increased uptake of effective safety equipment. <LINK REF="REF-Hewitt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewitt 2008</LINK> challenges this approach, arguing that observational studies are potentially biased and this is why we conduct randomised trials. Specifically they assert that <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>'s result indicates potential for harm caused by the intervention.</P>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gitlin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gitlin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2004</LINK>) in this review assess a change in safety features or hazards without reporting injury occurrence. Whilst it is logical to deduce that physical hazards in the home will contribute to a sequence of events culminating in an injury, it is not possible to conclude that the modification of such hazards will definitely reduce the number of injuries. However, even though a direct association can not be made between hazard reduction and injury reduction, the three studies which reported a significant reduction in hazards (<LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2004</LINK>) can be viewed encouragingly.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Sangvai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sangvai 2007</LINK> reported significant reductions in hazards in the IG, the very large losses to follow-up may have been a potential source of bias. The more enthusiastic participants who implemented the home safety intervention more effectively may have been more likely to agree to a follow-up home visit. This may have led to an over-estimation of the effectiveness of this intervention.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2002</LINK> found no significant difference in safety practices between study groups, an adjusted sub-analysis revealed families who visited the safety centre were significantly more likely to have 3 or more safety practices compared to families who did not (34% vs 17% &#8805;3).  However these results should be interpreted with caution, given the analysis was based on non-randomised participants.  The study authors mentioned that during the home visit safety products were not installed due to concerns around liability. Other studies which have since obtained liability waivers and installed safety products have been shown to be more successful (<LINK REF="STD-King-2005" TYPE="STUDY">King 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is worth noting that there are currently no RCTs included in the mixed age group. A controlled clinical trial by <LINK REF="STD-Petridou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Petridou 1997</LINK> included only 172 households and 636 people in the IG. Significant improvement in the provision of automatic electricity cut off devices and better lighting in corridors as well as first aid kits were reported post intervention but there were no changes in structural or expensive interventions, for example, modification to stairs or balconies. A non-significant 21% reduction in home injuries was reported (95% CI -40% to +6%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Meta-analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>Attempting to carry out meta-analyses with the studies included in this review proved to be problematic. The majority of studies included were too methodologically and statistically heterogenous to combine the results. Specifically, studies varied in terms of the characteristics of the population, inclusion and exclusion criteria and components of the intervention. Populations varied in terms of age, cognitive function and physical ability. Inclusion and exclusion criteria differed inasmuch as studies might include only those who had had a previous fall, attended the emergency department or been admitted to hospital after a fall. This may mean that populations in these studies could be considered at higher risk of falling and thus results might be less generalisable. Components of the interventions differed greatly. Participants might be visited at home or not, safety equipment might be free, means tested, directly supplied or referral made to a service where it could be obtained. Medication reviews were sometimes carried out, exercise programmes might be included and, if so, provided directly or referred to a programme. In some studies direct assistance with hazard modification might be provided or advice only given. Outcomes also differed. These included falls, injurious fall, fractures, self reported injuries and medically attended injuries. When studies appeared methodologically similar and combining data appeared plausible, we attempted meta-analysis. In the end only one meta-analysis was included in this review, as the other attempted analyses were too statistically heterogeneous.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusion</HEADING>
<P>The conclusion of this systematic review is that there is very little high-grade evidence that interventions to modify the home physical environment affect the likelihood of sustaining an injury in the home.</P>
<P>The first version of this review included 28 studies (13 RCTs, 14 CCTs and one before-and-after study). The 2006 update identified six additional RCTs which allowed the inclusion criteria to be limited to higher quality randomised controlled studies. In this update we identified a further 10 RCTs. However this review still does not provide a clear, unequivocal evidence base that modification of the home environment reduces injuries. None of the studies focusing on children demonstrated a reduction in injuries that might have been due to environmental adaptation in the home; one study reported a reduction in injuries and hazards but the two could not be directly associated. Of the 20 included studies in the older people category, none demonstrated a reduction in injuries that could be directly linked to hazard reduction, although two demonstrated a reduction in falls that may have been due to environmental hazard reduction in the home. This is not the same as saying that such interventions are ineffective. It should be remembered that many of the studies in this review were powered to detect changes in <I>all</I> falls and injuries. Therefore it is likely that these studies were under-powered to detect a change in falls and injuries that occurred specifically as a result of an environmental hazard in the home. In addition, it is often difficult to fund studies which focus on the prevention of injuries as an outcome, as large numbers of participants are often required for the study to be adequately powered. The studies in this review also tended to be conducted in areas where the major environmental home hazards had already been removed, making it possible for only modest changes in the environment to be observed. It is also important to highlight that, due to the stringent exclusion criteria for this review, studies may have been excluded where allocation concealment was carried out but not reported adequately in the methodology.</P>
<P>Although the debate surrounding the effectiveness of multifactorial interventions continues, they have been shown to be effective at reducing falls (<LINK REF="STD-Day-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jenson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinetti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tinetti 1994</LINK>). It is important however to know the cost-effectiveness of specific components of multifactorial interventions, so that scarce resources can be targeted to the most effective interventions. In order to answer these questions, future studies should adopt a factorial design and have sufficient power to detect modest, but important, changes in injury occurrence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias can threaten the validity of systematic reviews if research which does not reach statistical significance or produces a counter-intuitive result is not published. We searched a large number of electronic databases covering health, social science and architectural domains. Although we contacted first authors of all included studies, we did not contact lead researchers in this update to ask about unpublished material, as in the first review it had a very low yield and was resource intensive. We cannot rule out the possibility, therefore, of missing studies published in journals not indexed in the electronic databases and which have not been referenced in any of the included studies. This review is limited to interventions with primary outcomes of reductions in injuries, falls and the prevalence of home hazards. It does not comment on the effectiveness of physical modification of the home environment with the intention of influencing other outcome measures, for example, morbidity, satisfaction, independence or quality of life.</P>

<P>The conclusion of this systematic review is that there is very little high-grade evidence that interventions to modify the home physical environment affect the likelihood of sustaining an injury in the home.</P>
<P>Injuries occur as a result of complex interactions between individuals and the environment and can always be considered multifactorial in nature. The results of this systematic review of modifying the physical environment in the home to reduce injuries (with the exception of the provision and promotion of smoke alarm ownership, which was excluded from the review) demonstrate a paucity of evidence on which to base current practice. Whilst it is logical to deduce that physical hazards and poor design and layout contribute to a sequence of events culminating in an injury, it is not possible to conclude that the amelioration of such hazards will definitely reduce the number of injuries. Nor is it possible to determine which aspects of multifactorial interventions are most cost effective. In the absence of good quality evidence, it is human nature for individuals to use interventions in the hope that they might be effective. This review has not shown that such interventions do not work. Limitations within the studies meant it was difficult to reach definitive conclusions in most cases.</P>

<P>RCTs provide the gold standard for the assessment of the effectiveness of interventions. This review shows the paucity of appropriately designed and sized studies to test the effectiveness of interventions to remove or reduce physical hazards in the home environment in reducing injury occurrence.</P>
<P>Studies were generally too small to have sufficient power to detect anything but a very large effect and rarely employed a factorial design that would allow an assessment of specific interventions as part of a multifactorial intervention. Most studies had very low uptake rates for interventions. The active involvement of participants in the design of studies might improve this. The challenge to the global injury research community is to collaborate to design and implement studies of a sufficient size, rigorous design and acceptability to participants to answer these important questions.</P>

The control group received a home visit by a research nurse for baseline questionnaire and risk factor measurements before randomisation took place (as did intervention group), a falls calendar for monthly falls recording and other variables (as did intervention group), phone call if their calendar was more than 7-10 days late in being returned each month (as did intervention group), a phone call if fall reported and a telephone interview regarding circumstances of the fall (as did intervention group), promise of being given most effective intervention at study end. About 50% of control group were re-visited at study end for risk factor measurements &amp; questionnaire (as did intervention group). There was, however, no placebo intervention for the control group, so they did not for example receive visits by a social worker etc.<BR/>

Although this analysis was adjusted for exposure to safety councelling and a home visit, and the authors found no socio-demographic confounders; it was based on non-randomised participants and is therefore susceptible to confounders and self selection bias. </P>

<TD>
<P>An interdisciplinary and multifactorial prevention programme targeting residents, staff and the environment may reduce falls and femoral fractures.</P>
<P>During the 34-week follow-up period, 44% of residents in the intervention group sustained a fall compared with 56% in the control group (RR 0.78, 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.96). The odds ratio adjusted for baseline factors was 0.49 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.65), and the incidence rate ratio of falls adjusted for baseline factors was 0.60 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.73). Three people in the intervention group and 12 people in the control group had a fracture to the femur (adjusted odds ratio, 0.23 (CI 0.06 to 0.94)).</P>
<P>In a later report (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2003</LINK>) the effect of this intervention in older people with differing levels of cognitive function was investigated. 59 minor, moderate or serious injuries occurred in the higher cognitive group (IRR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.5) compared with the control group and similarly in the lower cognitive group (IRR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.3). However in the lower cognitive group the 171 participants sustained 10 femoral fractures, all of which were in the control group (P = 0.006).</P>
