<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-02 16:51:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Bladder and kidney infections (urinary tract infection - UTI) are common in children, especially girls. They cause an uncomfortable illness that can include vomiting, fever and tiredness. In some children kidney damage may occur, as can repeat illnesses. With repeated infections the risk of kidney damage increases. Some doctors prescribe long-term antibiotics to try to prevent infections recurring, but this may cause the child to be unwell in other ways, e.g. vomiting. This review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found evidence that long-term antibiotics did reduce the risk of more symptomatic infections but the benefit is small and must be weighed against the likelihood that future infections may be with bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic given.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-17 13:36:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Twelve studies (1557 children) were identified with six (five analysed, 1069 children) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. Duration of antibiotic prophylaxis varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, when all studies were included, antibiotics did not appear to reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.53) however when we evaluated the effects of antibiotics in studies with low risk of bias, there was a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The effect was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12). There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events. Three studies reported antibiotic resistance, showing a non-significant increased risk for resistance to the antibiotic in the active treatment groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26).</P>
<P>Five studies (4 analysed, 367 children) compared one antibiotic with another but all compared different combinations or different outcomes and studies were not pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance, nitrofurantoin having a significantly lower risk of resistance than cotrimoxazole (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).</P>
<P>One study compared alternate with every day cefadroxil treatment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-11 15:13:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode (<LINK REF="REF-Hellstrom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstrom 1991</LINK>). Death is now a rare complication but hospitalisation is frequently required (40%), particularly in infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1998</LINK>). Transient damage to the kidneys occurs in about 40% of children affected (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1998</LINK>), and permanent damage occurs in about 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Coulthard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulthard 1997</LINK>), sometimes even following a single infection. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by <I>Escherichia coli</I> in over 80% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Rushton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rushton 1997</LINK>) and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics.</P>
<P>Children who have had one infection are at risk of further infections. Recurrent UTI occurs in up to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1975</LINK>). The risk factors for recurrent infection are vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), bladder instability and previous infections (<LINK REF="REF-Hellerstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellerstein 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rushton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rushton 1997</LINK>). Recurrence of UTI occurs more commonly in girls than boys (<LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. Cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim are commonly used for this purpose. These medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aims of this review were to assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment</P>

<P>Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Two crossover studies did not provide data on the first phase and thus could not be included in the meta-analyses, but findings are described in the text (<LINK REF="STD-Carlsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Carlsen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lohr-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Lohr 1977</LINK>). Of the 10 studies with appropriately reported data, five examined antibiotics versus placebo/no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savage-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stansfeld-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Stansfeld 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smellie-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smellie 1978</LINK>).

The most recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>) involved a more balanced gender ratio and with the expected proportion having VUR (30% to 40%). The duration of long-term antibiotic treatment (nitrofurantoin, cotrimoxazole, co-amoxiclav or ampicillin) varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. The crossover study comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Lohr-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Lohr 1977</LINK>) included 18 girls with frequent recurrences, 10 of whom commenced the study on nitrofurantoin, crossing to placebo after six months and eight commenced on placebo and crossed over to nitrofurantoin after six months.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-14 08:29:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Long-term, low dose antibiotics were associated with a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from all studies was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Earlier versions of this review concluded that the evidence to support the use of antibiotics to prevent recurrent symptomatic UTI was weak. The addition of data from two recent, large and well reported studies has changed this conclusion (<LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> was optimally designed with all features of good designed reported in the article (randomisation process, allocation concealment, blinding, explanations for incomplete data, appropriate outcome reporting and consideration for other bias). <LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK>, while somewhat smaller, unblinded and with no placebo treatment, gave a RR (0.75) that was reasonably consistent with results from the <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> (RR 0.65); only the <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> reached statistical significance. These estimates are the least biased and therefore likely to reflect the true effect of prophylactic antibiotic treatment.</P>
<P>The estimated absolute risk reduction was 8% and corresponds to the need to treat between 12 and 13 children for 12 months to prevent one symptomatic UTI. The absolute treatment effect appears consistent in children with and without VUR, a known risk factor for further UTI.잸lthough antibiotic prophylaxis prevents UTI overall, the data suggest that prolonged administration results in changes in the susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI caused by bacteria resistant to the prophylactic agent.</P>
<P>The smaller and older studies gave highly variable and inconsistent findings, highlighting the effect of poor design and chance effects on study findings. Earlier studies tended to report repeat positive urine culture as their primary outcome and significant reductions in the risk of repeat positive urine cultures were found in the antibiotic groups of these studies. However, the appropriateness of this as an outcome is questionable given that few doctors would treat asymptomatic bacteriuria. Further limitations to these studies are the quality of their design. Only 2/4 studies used adequate allocation concealment and 1/4 reported double blinding. Our analyses show that the poorly designed studies inflate the treatment effect by 49%, and ranging from 100% to 400% (using <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.2) compared to those with better design.</P>
<P>Only the <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> reported sufficient detail to identify the time frame for recurrence of symptomatic UTI, in this study 36% of UTIs in the active arm and 47% in the placebo arm occurred within three months of randomisation. A further 19% and 29% (active and placebo arms respectively) of repeat symptomatic UTIs occurred between three and six months post randomisation. This infers that the risk of repeat symptomatic infection is highest during the three months following initial infection and may suggest an initial course of treatment of three months with possible extension to six months.</P>
<P>The side effects of active treatment compared to placebo or no treatment were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>). The unblinded study (<LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK>) reported 15 events in the active treatment arm and none in the no-treatment group, while the blinded study (<LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>) showed considerably more events in the placebo arm compared to active treatment (10 versus 4). This suggests interpretation of adverse events is influenced by knowledge of treatment group, suggesting the blinded study is a more reliable estimate of rates of adverse events.</P>
<P>Three studies reported the numbers of urine cultures causing symptomatic UTI that grew bacteria resistant to the active treatment in the studies with placebo comparisons. Two studies reported that 8% of the cultures in the no treatment arm were resistant to the active drug but the <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> showed that 18% of urine infections were caused by bacteria resistant to the active treatment. This suggests the baseline risk of resistance in the non-treated group is not zero and is likely to be closer to 18% given the greater reliability of <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK> reported bacterial resistance in the active treatment arms, with over half (53%) of UTIs in the active arm in <LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK> and 28% of UTIs in the active arm of <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> being attributed to bacteria resistant to the active treatment drug. While the RR is imprecise (2.4), as shown by the large 95% CI (0.62 to 9.26), the risk appears increased.</P>
<P>Although nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim or cotrimoxazole in preventing repeat symptomatic infection or repeat positive urine culture, it was associated with a greater number of side effects. The harmful effects of nitrofurantoin outweigh the prophylactic benefit and suggest that nitrofurantoin may not be an acceptable therapy. Patient compliance would be an important factor to consider in deciding on the use of nitrofurantoin as prophylaxis.</P>
<P>The combined analysis of the studies included in this review show there is a small benefit in long-term antibiotic treatment to prevent repeat symptomatic UTI however this should be weighed up against the increased likelihood of bacterial resistance in subsequent infections, the baseline risk of repeat symptomatic infection and how strongly parents and physicians wish to avoid a possible repeat illness.</P>

<P>Prior to <LINK REF="STD-Montini-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Montini 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>, the evidence to support long-term, low dose antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in children without VUR consisted of a small number of poor quality studies that gave inconsistent and imprecise results. The addition of data from two much larger and better designed studies changes this. The analysis now demonstrates, with considerable consistency, a small benefit of low dose antibiotics to prevent repeat symptomatic UTI in children. The data show little adverse effects from the antibiotic treatment but demonstrate an increased risk of bacterial resistance to the treatment drug in subsequent infections. A single study reported event time periods and showed that the greatest risk of repeat symptomatic infection occurs in the three to six months following initial UTI. Nitrofurantoin appeared the most effective treatment but led to considerable adverse events.</P>

<P>Publication of two larger, better designed studies have provided evidence on which physicians making decisions about low dose antibiotics to prevent repeat symptomatic UTI in children can be guided. Benefits and harms are now much clearer and can be used in decisions about this treatment. Older studies tended to be poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect.</P>

<P>This multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to determine whether daily antimicrobial prophylaxis is superior to placebo in preventing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment for 2 years with daily antimicrobial prophylaxis (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) or placebo. The study is designed to recruit 600 children (approximately 300 in each treatment group) over a 24 month period. The protocol will encourage prompt evaluation of children with UTI symptoms and early therapy of culture-proven UTIs. It is expected that approximately 10% of children will have to discontinue study medication due to allergic reactions. Assuming a 20% placebo event rate and 10% non-compliance rate, the study has 83% power to detect an absolute 10% event rate in the antimicrobial prophylaxis group. If the placebo event rate is instead 25%, power is 97% to detect an absolute 10% event rate in the treated group, even if non-compliance is as high as 15%.</P>
<P>In addition to collecting follow-up data on urinary tract infections, renal scarring and antimicrobial resistance, quality of life, compliance, safety parameters, utilization of health resources, and change in VUR will be assessed periodically throughout the study.</P>
