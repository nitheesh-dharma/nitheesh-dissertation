<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Many children suffer head injuries while riding a bike. This review focused on encouraging children to wear helmets, as distinct from compelling them to do so through laws. The authors wanted to find out which sort of helmet programmes work best, particularly with children from poor families who are less likely to own helmets. They found 29 helmet promotion programmes that had been studied. The programmes varied widely with regard to where they were carried out, age of the children, programme methods, etc. The results were also very varied but overall 11 studies found that after a helmet programme children were more likely to be observed wearing helmets than other children. More research is still needed but it seems likely that the best schemes are based in the community and involve both education and providing free helmets. Promotion of helmets in schools also seems to be effective. Promoting helmets appears to be more effective for younger children (aged 12 years and under) than for older children and young people. The studies reviewed did not look at the impact of helmet programmes on injury rates, or assess whether programmes had any negative effects such as reducing cycling. Most of the studies were undertaken in higher-income countries and the additional effect of helmet promotion above existing legislation was not explored. More research is needed to understand more about whether providing subsidised helmets is as effective as providing free helmets and whether programmes in healthcare settings are as effective as those in schools or communities. Other types of helmet programmes (e.g. those including peer educators, those developing skills such as decision making and resisting peer pressure, or improving self esteem or self efficacy) need developing and testing, particularly for 11 to 18 year olds. The effect of helmet programmes in countries with existing cycle helmet legislation and in low and middle-income countries also requires investigation.</P>

<P>Helmets reduce bicycle-related head injuries, particularly in single vehicle crashes and those where the head strikes the ground. We aimed to identify non-legislative interventions for promoting helmet use among children, so future interventions can be designed on a firm evidence base.</P>

<P>To assess the effectiveness of non-legislative interventions in increasing helmet use among children; to identify possible reasons for differences in effectiveness of interventions; to evaluate effectiveness with respect to social group; to identify adverse consequences of interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO (Ovid); PsycEXTRA (Ovid); CINAHL (EBSCO); ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S); and PubMed from inception to April 2009; TRANSPORT to 2007; and manually searched other sources of data.</P>

<P>We included RCTs and CBAs. Studies included participants aged 0 to 18 years, described interventions promoting helmet use not requiring enactment of legislation and reported observed helmet wearing, self reported helmet ownership or self reported helmet wearing.</P>

<P>Two independent review authors selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) (with 95% confidence interval (CI)). We explored heterogeneity with subgroup analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We included 29 studies in the review, 21 of which were included in at least one meta-analysis. Non-legislative interventions increased observed helmet wearing (11 studies: OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.34). The effect was most marked amongst community-based interventions (four studies: OR 4.30, 95% 2.24 to 8.25) and those providing free helmets (two studies: OR 4.35, 95% CI 2.13 to 8.89). Significant effects were also found amongst school-based interventions (eight studies: OR 1.73, CI 95% 1.03 to 2.91), with a smaller effect found for interventions providing education only (three studies: OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.88). No significant effect was found for providing subsidised helmets (seven studies: OR 2.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.17). Interventions provided to younger children (aged under 12) may be more effective (five studies: OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.37) than those provided to children of all ages (five studies: OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.42).</P>
<P>Interventions were only effective in increasing self reported helmet ownership where they provided free helmets (three studies: OR 11.63, 95% CI 2.14 to 63.16).</P>
<P>Interventions were effective in increasing self reported helmet wearing (nine studies: OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.56 to 6.87), including those undertaken in schools (six studies: OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.74), providing free helmets (three studies: OR 7.27, 95% CI 1.28 to 41.44), providing education only (seven studies: OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.63) and in healthcare settings (two studies: OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.61). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Non-legislative interventions appear to be effective in increasing observed helmet use, particularly community-based interventions and those providing free helmets. Those set in schools appear to be effective but possibly less so than community-based interventions. Interventions providing education only are less effective than those providing free helmets. There is insufficient evidence to recommend providing subsidised helmets at present. Interventions may be more effective if provided to younger rather than older children. There is evidence that interventions offered in healthcare settings can increase self reported helmet wearing.</P>
<P>Further high-quality studies are needed to explore whether non-legislative interventions increase helmet wearing, and particularly the effect of providing subsided as opposed to free helmets, and of providing interventions in healthcare settings as opposed to in schools or communities. Alternative interventions (e.g. those including peer educators, those aimed at developing safety skills including skills in decision making and resisting peer pressure or those aimed at improving self esteem or self efficacy) need developing and testing, particularly for 11 to 18 year olds. The effect of interventions in countries with existing cycle helmet legislation and in low and middle-income countries also requires investigation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Injuries to child cyclists are an important public health problem. On British roads, in 2009, 545 children were killed or seriously injured while cycling (<LINK REF="REF-DfT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">DfT 2010</LINK>). Forty-five per cent of child cyclists admitted to hospital for cycling injures between 1999 and 2005 sustained a head injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hynd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hynd 2009</LINK>). There is a steep social class gradient for cycling injuries in childhood, with mortality rates in children from social class five being four times higher than those from social class one (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>). Hospital admission rates for cycling injuries have also been found to be 61% higher amongst children residing in deprived wards compared to those in affluent wards (<LINK REF="REF-Hippisley_x002d_Cox--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippisley-Cox 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence that cycle helmets reduce head injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Hynd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hynd 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Towner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Towner 1992</LINK>), particularly in single vehicle accidents, or accidents that cause the head of the cyclist to strike the ground (<LINK REF="REF-Hynd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hynd 2009</LINK>). It has also been suggested that cycle helmets may be particularly effective in children who tend to fall a shorter distance, and which is more likely to be within the distance used in the European Standard Impact Test for Cycle Helmets (EW1078) (<LINK REF="REF-Hynd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hynd 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies suggest bicycle helmets are used less commonly amongst children from socio-economically deprived backgrounds (<LINK REF="STD-Farley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Farley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parkin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 1993</LINK>). Other factors may also be important in encouraging children to wear cycle helmets, including peer pressure, parental helmet use and school policies (<LINK REF="REF-Lajunen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lajunen 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Many authors have described bicycle helmet promotion programmes that aim to encourage children to wear helmets, but the programmes have varied widely in terms of their effectiveness and the strategies employed. It is difficult, therefore, to know from individual studies how effective cycle helmet promotion programmes have been, which elements of the programmes contribute to their effectiveness, and whether the effect is similar in different social groups or settings. This information is vital for planning and delivering effective cycle helmet programmes in the future. The aim of this review is to identify those non-legislative interventions that are effective in promoting helmet use among children, so that future interventions can be designed from a firm evidence base.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>Two review authors independently inspected the titles and abstracts to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. We rejected abstracts that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Two independent review authors assessed full copies of papers that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. Uncertainties concerning the appropriateness of studies for inclusion in the review were resolved through consultation with a third review author.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We designed a standard data extraction form and used it to extract data on participants, socio-economic characteristics, interventions and outcomes. Two researchers independently extracted and compared data. Any discrepancies were identified and resolved at a meeting of the review authors. We took special care to avoid the inclusion of multiple reports pertaining to the same individuals, for example in trials reporting outcomes over multiple time periods. Where data were not available in the published study reports, we contacted authors to supply missing information.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For randomised controlled trials, we used allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow-up as the three markers of trial quality. The number of randomised controlled trials included in the review was too small to allow a sensitivity analysis based on these three quality markers. For non-randomised controlled trials, we used blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow-up as markers of quality, plus assessment of the distribution of confounders. Two review authors assessed quality independently and disagreements were resolved through consultation with a third review author. Findings in relation to quality markers for randomised and non-randomised studies are reported in the table describing the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We pooled results by outcome and presented them as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed all analyses using RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) with random-effects models to allow for and quantify the degree of statistical heterogeneity present between individual studies (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). Where cluster-randomised trials were reported without appropriate adjustment for clustering, we approached the authors to obtain information on the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) or to obtain data from which we could calculate an ICC. Since none of the studies had either calculated an ICC or did not provide us with data from which we could calculate the ICC, we adjusted the reported treatment effect for clustering using an ICC of 0.02 as reported in a school-based health promotion intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2004</LINK>). We also undertook sensitivity analyses using ICCs of 0.01 and 0.05 because we believe they represent the extremes of a range within which the true value is likely to be found (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis comparing treatment effect by social group was not possible, as only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 1995</LINK>) were undertaken with participants from low-income communities and these measured different outcomes, and one had a non-comparable control group (<LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 2004</LINK>). Two further studies reported their results stratified by income (<LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Farley 1996</LINK>) but these used different measures of income level, hence pooling of results was not possible.</P>

<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> is a QUOROM flow diagram describing the process of study selection. We included 29 studies in the review and they are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Six were individually randomised controlled trials, eight were cluster-randomised controlled trials, 14 were controlled before-after studies and one was a quasi-randomised trial. Eighteen studies were set in the US, six in Canada, three in the UK, one in Australia and one in New Zealand. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1998</LINK>) only included pre-school children and a second included children aged between five and eight years (<LINK REF="STD-Liller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liller 1995</LINK>). The remainder included children from a range of ages up to 18 years. Thirteen studies focused on children of primary school age, seven on children of secondary school age and nine spanned both school ranges. Four studies involved participants in community settings, six in healthcare settings and the remaining 19 in schools. Nine interventions included the distribution of free helmets, 11 provided subsidised helmets and nine provided purely educational interventions. Those providing free or subsidised helmets also included an element of cycle helmet education. Fourteen studies reported observed helmet wearing as an outcome, 10 included self reported helmet ownership and 17 self reported helmet wearing. Many studies reported more than one outcome.</P>

<P>None of the included studies reported any adverse effects of interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Observed helmet wearing</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The odds of observed helmet wearing were significantly higher amongst those receiving non-legislative interventions promoting cycle helmet use (odds ratio (OR) 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 3.34) than amongst those not receiving such interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between effect sizes of the studies included in this analysis (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 30.34, degrees of freedom (df) = 10, P = 0.0008). The findings were robust to assuming intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.01 and 0.05 for studies using cluster allocation and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> illustrates that publication bias was not detected (regression coefficient = 0.33, SE = 1.11, Egger's test P = 0.77).</P>
<P>We assessed the effect of study quality by restricting analyses to the three randomised controlled trials reporting this outcome and no significant effect was demonstrated (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.63).</P>
<P>As there was significant heterogeneity amongst effect sizes, we undertook subgroup analyses to explore possible explanations for this. These included examining the effect by setting (community or school), type of intervention (free helmet, subsidised helmet or education only) and age (younger (&#8804; 12 years), older (&#8805; 11 years) or all ages (0 to 18 years)). We chose these subgroups as it seemed theoretically plausible that these factors might influence the effectiveness of the intervention.</P>
<P>Non-legislative interventions appeared to be effective in both community (four studies: OR 4.30, 95% CI 2.24 to 8.25; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.72, df = 3, P = 0.87) and school-based settings (eight studies: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.91; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 23.79, df = 7, P = 0.001), with a possibly greater effect amongst those in community settings. Providing free helmets (two studies: OR 4.35, 95% CI 2.13 to 8.89; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.47, df = 1, P = 0.49) was more effective than providing education only (three studies: OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.88; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.29, df = 2, P = 0.53). The effect of providing subsidised helmets failed to reach statistical significance and there was significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (seven studies: OR 2.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.17; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 20.29, df = 6, P = 0.002). Interventions focusing on younger children (aged 12 years and under) were effective (five studies: OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.37; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 12.46, df = 4, P = 0.01), whilst those including children and young people of all ages (0 to 18 years) failed to demonstrate a significant effect (five studies: OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.42; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 6.63, df = 4, P = 0.16). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2004</LINK>) focused only on older children and young people (aged 11 to 18 years) and this failed to demonstrate a significant effect (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.51). </P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses indicated that all subgroup analyses were robust to assuming ICCs of 0.01 and 0.05 for studies using cluster allocation, except when assuming an ICC of 0.05 when the effect of providing education only became non-significant (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.15) and that of providing subsidised helmets became significant (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.98).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Self reported helmet ownership</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. No significant effect of non-legislative interventions was found for self reported helmet ownership (OR 2.67, 95% CI 0.89 to 8.03) compared to no intervention and there was significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 64.75, df = 6, P &lt; 0.00001). The findings were robust to assuming ICCs of 0.01 and 0.05 for studies using cluster allocation and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> illustrates that publication bias was not detected (regression coefficient = 5.41, SE = 5.66, Egger's test P = 0.38).</P>
<P>Amongst the four randomised controlled trials, no significant effect of non-legislative interventions was found (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.77) compared to those not receiving such interventions and there was significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>= 16.92, df = 3, P = 0.0007).</P>
<P>We again undertook subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity in effect sizes. Interventions providing free helmets were effective in increasing self reported helmet ownership (three studies: OR 11.63, 95% CI 2.14 to 63.16; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 15.94, df = 2, P = 0.0003) but there was significant heterogeneity between effect sizes. Providing community-based interventions (two studies: OR 5.65, 95% CI 0.82 to 38.98; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 8.37, df = 1, P = 0.004), school-based interventions (three studies: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.76; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 2.10, df = 2, P = 0.33) or interventions in healthcare settings (three studies: OR 3.84, 95% CI 0.46 to 32.36; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 31.53, df = 2, P = &lt; 0.00001) did not appear to be effective.</P>
<P>Providing education only did not appear to be effective (three studies: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.66, df = 2, P = 0.72) and the age of the children to whom interventions were provided also appeared to have no significant effect (studies focusing on children 12 years or under (four studies: OR 2.09, 95% CI 0.47 to 9.25; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 33.89, df = 3, P = &lt; 0.00001) and studies including children and young people of all ages (0 to 18 years) (three studies: OR 3.84, 95% CI 0.46 to 32.36; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 31.53, df = 2, P = &lt; 0.00001).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Self reported helmet wearing</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The odds of self reported helmet wearing were significantly greater amongst those receiving interventions (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.56 to 6.87) compared to those receiving no intervention but there was significant heterogeneity between the effect sizes (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 53.23, df = 8, P = &lt; 0.00001).<B> </B>These results were robust to assuming ICCs of 0.01 and 0.05 for studies using cluster allocation. <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> shows evidence of publication bias for this outcome (regression coefficient = 2.64, SE = 1.12, Egger's test P = 0.05).</P>
<P>Amongst the five randomised controlled trials, the odds of self reported helmet wearing were not significantly greater in those receiving interventions (OR 3.02, 95% CI 0.72  to 12.76) and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 46.28, df = 4, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>We undertook subgroup analyses to explore the heterogeneity. Interventions set in schools (six studies: OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.74; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 48.58, df = 5, P &lt; 0.00001) and in healthcare settings (two studies: OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.61; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.02, df = 1, P = 0.90) were both effective in increasing self reported helmet wearing. Those providing free helmets (three studies: OR 7.27, 95% CI 1.28 to 41.44; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 10.26, df = 2, P = 0.006) and those providing education only (seven studies: OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.63; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 14.45, df = 6, P = 0.02) were also both effective, with possibly a greater effect in those providing free helmets. Interventions which focused on older children and young people only (aged 11 years and older) were effective (three studies: OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.68 to 14.83; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 2.98, df = 2, P = 0.22), whilst those focusing on younger children (aged 12 years or under) (four studies: OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.51; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 8.38, df = 3, P = 0.04), or those including children and young people (0 to 18 years) (two studies: OR 10.48, 95% CI 0.69 to 158.51; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 13.20, df = 1, P = 0.003) failed to demonstrate a significant effect. All subgroup analyses were robust to assuming ICCs of 0.01 and 0.05 for studies using cluster allocation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies not included in the meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies satisfied our inclusion criteria but could not be included the meta-analyses for reasons described in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Azeredo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Azeredo 2003</LINK>, reporting the results of a school-based programme of education and school bicycle fairs with give-away helmets, reported that observed helmet wearing increased from 0% to 10% from baseline to follow-up in intervention schools, but observations of cycle helmets were not made in control schools. <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 2004</LINK> found that a helmet and an education pack was as effective as a helmet and a multifaceted intervention in terms of helmet ownership (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.58) and wearing (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.68). This study also found that providing free helmets and school-based education to children in schools in disadvantaged areas reduced inequalities in helmet ownership that existed prior to the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1997</LINK> reported an adjusted odds ratio for helmet use comparing co-payment with free helmets of 1.66 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.92). They concluded that helmet use was not significantly different among children whose parents were asked for a small copayment compared with those receiving free helmets. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2000</LINK> reported an increase in self reported helmet use among 11 to 15 year olds living in the campaign area from 11% to 31% after five years (P &lt; 0.001), with no change in the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Leverence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leverence 2004</LINK> did not report a significant improvement from baseline in self reported cycle helmet use in either the intervention (mean difference 0; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.2) or control group (mean difference -0.02, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.3). <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1990</LINK> reported a significant increase in observed helmet wearing from a baseline of 3.5% in the intervention group to 33.3% at 10 weeks.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-12-15 14:29:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Main findings</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review has identified 29 studies of non-legislative interventions to promote the wearing of bicycle helmets by school children. The studies varied widely in a number of important characteristics including: setting, age of participants, components of the intervention, length of follow-up and outcomes reported. This 'clinical' heterogeneity was reflected in statistical heterogeneity when results were pooled in many of the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Focusing on observed helmet wearing, as this is the most objective outcome measure, we have found that non-legislative interventions appear to be effective. However, we found no significant effect when restricting analyses to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), although this analysis only included three studies. Subgroup analyses indicated that community-based and school-based interventions are both effective in increasing observed helmet wearing, with possibly a greater effect seen with community-based interventions. Providing free helmets is more effective than providing education only and possibly more effective than providing subsidised helmets. Interventions provided to younger children were effective, whilst those provided to older children and young people were not.</P>
<P>Less emphasis should be placed on our findings using self reported outcomes because of the possibility of differential social desirability bias between treatment arms in included studies. For self reported helmet ownership we found a significant effect favouring the intervention group only where free helmets were provided. For self reported helmet wearing we found significant effects favouring the intervention group for any non-legislative intervention, for school-based interventions, for those delivered in healthcare settings, for those providing free helmets, for those providing education only and for those provided to older children and young people. No significant effects were found when analyses were restricted to RCTs for both self reported helmet ownership or wearing.</P>
<P>New subgroup analyses undertaken in the update to this review include interventions in healthcare settings and interventions by child age. The few studies included in the meta-analysis for healthcare settings understandably relied on self reported outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2005</LINK> showed a very positive effect, demonstrating that providing free helmets may be a beneficial intervention in this setting. A brief intervention, which is often the most appealing to health professionals, failed to demonstrate an effect (<LINK REF="STD-Leverence-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leverence 2004</LINK>), whilst slightly longer counselling provided in the <LINK REF="STD-Bishai-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bishai 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2002</LINK> studies showed significant increases in reported helmet wearing. Further studies are needed in heathcare settings to determine whether non-legislative interventions are effective, and the components of effective interventions. In terms of the most effective age at which to intervene, our findings suggest that providing interventions to children aged 12 and under is likely to be more effective than providing them to older children and young people. The positive effect on self reported helmet wearing seen in older children and young people may represent social desirability bias which may be more likely to operate amongst older than younger children. Alternative interventions need to be developed and tested to explore increasing helmet use in older children and young people. Most studies had relatively short follow-up periods, hence the duration of the effectiveness of interventions provided to younger children is unknown. It is possible that the effect may diminish both over time and with increasing child age. Studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions amongst younger children with longer follow-up periods are therefore required.</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis and subgroup analyses of studies using self reported helmet ownership as an outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Britt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1998</LINK> stands out because of its positive results. This study was unique in that it was confined to a younger age group than any of the other studies, and also in that it was the participants' parents rather than the participants themselves that reported helmet ownership. Hence it is possible that parents may have over-reported their children's helmet ownership. Also this non-randomised study did not report on the distribution of confounders, hence it is possible that differences between the treatment groups may partly explain the positive findings.</P>
<P>Several studies found negative effects of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macarthur-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Macarthur 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stutts 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Towner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Towner 1992</LINK> ). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Towner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Towner 1992</LINK> had a very low follow-up rate, suggesting that attrition bias may have occurred, which must be taken into account when considering these results. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Stutts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stutts 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Macarthur-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Macarthur 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2002</LINK> only provided education and our review did not analyse the amount, quality or style of the education given, and this may partly explain these findings. Further studies exploring the effect of specific educational packages would be helpful in elucidating which elements are least and most effective, but as we found the effect of providing education only was significantly smaller than providing free helmets, future helmet promotion programmes should provide free helmets as part of their intervention. The type of education provided with free helmets requires further exploration, as <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 2004</LINK> found no significant difference between providing education and a free helmet and providing more intense multifaceted education and a free helmet.</P>
<P>There was evidence of publication bias in the meta-analysis for self reported helmet wearing. This suggests the possible existence of unpublished studies with negative findings, which would tend to reduce the apparent effectiveness of non-legislative interventions on self reported helmet wearing. As discussed above, there may be considerable potential for differential social desirability bias in the reporting of this outcome. Such bias may have contributed to the apparent lack of studies with negative effects in this analysis. One must also consider the impact of legislation in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2004</LINK> set in Australia, as the background rate of helmet wearing is likely to be higher in countries that have imposed legislation, leading to a potential ceiling effect.</P>
<P>Several subgroup analyses included only a small number of studies and a relatively small number of study participants which lead to imprecise estimates of the effect of interventions. This was particularly true of the subgroup analyses relating to randomised controlled trials, community and school-based studies and those providing free helmets which reported self reported helmet ownership, studies in healthcare settings, focusing on older children and young people and studies providing free helmets which reported self reported helmet wearing. Hence, failure to demonstrate an effect of the intervention in these analyses may have resulted from a lack of power.</P>
<P>Confining analyses to RCTs as an assessment of the effect of study quality on outcomes was limited for self reported helmet ownership as three of the four included trials were hospital-based studies, evaluating physician counselling, so differences in the effect size between these studies and the remaining studies included in the meta-analyses may have arisen as a result of differences in participants, interventions and settings rather than in study quality. Our sensitivity analyses indicated that with the exception of two of our analyses, our findings were robust to using a range of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and weaknesses of this review</HEADING>
<P>This is a rigorously conducted and methodologically sound systematic review that has important implications for clinicians and policymakers planning non-legislative interventions to promote cycle helmet use in children. However, health promotion interventions are notoriously difficult to combine in conventional systematic reviews because of clinical and statistical heterogeneity and this review is no exception. We have identified this in our meta-analyses but have not been able to fully explain it with subgroup analyses. A lack of randomised controlled trials in this area means that the majority of included studies were potentially at risk of bias and confounding. The included studies also share three other important characteristics that limit the usefulness of our conclusions to some extent. Firstly, most of the studies reported their results after a short follow-up period (median two months, range two weeks to two years) and the sustainability of any positive effects cannot be evaluated. Secondly few studies explored the effect of interventions in low-income communities, so the generalisability of our findings to such communities is unknown. One study included in our review found that providing education and free helmets to children in schools in disadvantaged areas reduced inequalities in cycle helmet ownership, but this requires confirmation from other studies along with its effect on reducing inequalities in cycle-related head injuries. Thirdly very few studies used more innovative interventions such as peer educators, interventions specifically aimed at enhancing decision making skills and increasing resistance to peer pressure or interventions aimed at increasing self esteem and self efficacy. Hence the effect of such interventions remains unknown. Finally all of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, hence we are not able to comment on the generalisability of our results to lower-income countries.</P>
<P>Our review has looked at ways to increase the wearing of helmets among children and young people, but it has not addressed whether they are wearing them correctly, which is clearly important for reducing cycle-related head injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Hynd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hynd 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-Macpherson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macpherson 2008</LINK> has demonstrated that legislation appears to be effective in increasing cycle helmet use and in reducing head injuries. Legislation does not have to be mutually exclusive from the other interventions highlighted in our review. Only one of our studies was from a country where there is legislation (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2004</LINK>), hence we cannot draw conclusions about the additional effect of non-legislative interventions where legislation is already in place. Further research is required to address this question.</P>
<P>Although none of the included studies identified any adverse effects of interventions, there remains a possibility that interventions to promote cycle helmet wearing may reduce cycling in children, with a potentially negative effect on child health. Further work is needed in this area.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-legislative interventions appear to be effective in increasing observed helmet use, particularly community-based interventions and those providing free helmets. Those set in schools appear to be effective but may have a lesser effect than community-based interventions. Interventions providing education only are less effective than those providing free helmets. There is insufficient evidence to recommend providing subsidised helmets at present. Interventions may be more effective if provided to younger children rather than older children. There is evidence that interventions offered in a healthcare settings can increase self reported helmet wearing, but none of these studies have measured observed helmet wearing.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-27 14:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Further high-quality studies are needed to explore whether non-legislative interventions increase helmet wearing. Whilst randomised controlled trials would be the ideal design, designing such trials may be challenging. Ideally such studies should measure observed helmet wearing, or validate self reported helmet wearing by observations. Further work is required to explore the effect of providing subsided as opposed to free helmets and of providing interventions in healthcare settings as opposed to in schools or communities. Studies should also investigate the duration of any observed effects, particularly in relation to changes as children grow older and by socio-economic group. Alternative interventions that go beyond the provision of helmet education and free or subsidised helmets (e.g. those including peer educators, those aimed at developing safety skills including skills in decision making and resisting peer pressure or those aimed at improving self esteem or self efficacy) need developing and testing, particularly for 11 to 18 year olds. The negative effects of interventions such as reduced cycling need to be measured in future studies. The effect of non-legislative interventions in countries with existing cycle helmet legislation and in low and middle-income countries requires investigation.</P>
