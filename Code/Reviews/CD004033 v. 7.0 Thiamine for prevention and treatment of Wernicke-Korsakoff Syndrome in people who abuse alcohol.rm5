<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-28 02:54:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ed Day">
<P>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a disorder of the brain caused by a deficiency of vitamin B<SUB>1</SUB> (thiamine). It is characterised by an acute onset of some or all of an eye movement disorder, lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movement (ataxia) and confusion. Patients may die in the acute phase, and many survivors go on to develop permanent memory impairment. Alcohol abuse is an important cause of WKS, although it is not the only consideration. Heavy drinking may lead to particular problems with uptake of thiamine from the diet.</P>
<P>When recognised, WKS is treated with thiamine, but it is not clear how effective this is, particularly in managing the mental features. Recommendations about dosage and duration of thiamine treatment are acknowledged to be arbitrary. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing thiamine with placebo or alternative treatments, or comparing different thiamine treatments. Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria, but  one reported no data that we could analyse, and analysis of the other study was limited by shortcomings in design and in presentation of the results. Therefore no good evidence could be derived from randomised controlled clinical trials to help physicians choose the right dose, frequency, route or duration of thiamine treatment for preventing or treating WKS due to alcohol abuse.</P>

<P>Autopsy studies suggest that Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is not a rare disorder, particularly in individuals who abuse alcohol. Thiamine has been established as the treatment of choice for over 50 years, but uncertainty remains about appropriate dosage and duration.

<P>Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria, but only one contained sufficient data for quantitative analysis. Ambrose (2001) randomly assigned participants (n = 107) to one of five doses of intramuscular thiamine and measured outcomes after 2 days of treatment. We compared the lowest dose (5 mg/day) with each of the other four doses. A significant difference favoured 200 mg/day compared with the 5-mg/day dose in determining the number of trials needed to meet inclusion criteria on a delayed alternation test (mean difference (MD) -17.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -35.4 to -0.40, P = 0.04). No significant differences emerged when the other doses were compared with 5 mg/day. The pattern of results did not reflect a simple dose-response relationship. The study had methodological shortcomings in design and in the presentation of results that limited further analysis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-25 15:18:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-25 15:18:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-25 15:18:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Alcohol abuse is associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric problems, and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is one of the most serious. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is traditionally thought of as a disorder of acute onset characterised by nystagmus, abducent and conjugate gaze palsies, ataxia of gait and a global confusional state, which may occur together or in various combinations (<LINK REF="REF-Victor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 1989</LINK>). It is due to deficiency of the B vitamin thiamine (vitamin B<SUB>1</SUB>, also known as <I>aneurin</I>). Carl Wernicke first described the disorder in 1881 in three cases, two associated with chronic alcohol dependence and one with persistent vomiting after sulphuric acid poisoning. The symptoms that Wernicke recorded included disturbances of eye movement, ataxia of gait, polyneuropathy and mental changes including apathy, decreased attention span and disorientation in time and space. He noted similar pathological changes in all three cases, in particular numerous punctate haemorrhages in the grey matter around the third and fourth ventricles and the aqueduct of Sylvius. Work by Alexander (1939) and then Jolliffe (1941) established the role of thiamine deficiency in development and potential treatment of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Lishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lishman 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1887 Sergei Korsakoff gave the first comprehensive account of the amnestic syndrome now known as Korsakoff psychosis (KP). He described a range of features including delirium, but the disorder came to be characterised by recent memory loss with confabulation but with relative preservation of other intellectual functions. The two disorders were brought together by Victor and colleagues in 1971 (<LINK REF="REF-Victor-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 1971</LINK>). WKS is now considered to be a unitary disorder comprising acute WE, which proceeds in a proportion of cases to KP. From a case series of 245 patients, Victor et al concluded that the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and mental confusion 'needs to be amplified to include the characteristic memory disorder' as well as peripheral neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Victor-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>A major complicating factor is that the pathology of WE may not be associated with the classical clinical triad in up to 90% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 1986</LINK>). The full triad of symptoms is recognised in just 0.05% of all hospital admissions, whereas the whole population prevalence of WKS based on autopsy studies in Western countries has been estimated at 1% to 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torvik-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torvik 1991</LINK>). Autopsy studies suggest that WE is not a rare disorder, particularly among abusers of alcohol. Therefore it has been suggested that a presumptive diagnosis of WE should be made for any patient with a history of alcohol abuse who may be at risk. This includes anyone showing evidence of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, acute confusion, memory disturbance, unexplained hypotension, hypothermia, coma or unconsciousness (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2000</LINK>). Operational criteria for the diagnosis of WE have been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Caine-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caine 1997</LINK>), and although they are not yet widely used, they can help in distinguishing this problem from other potentially coexisting conditions such as alcohol withdrawal or hepatic encephalopathy.</P>
<P>When untreated, WE leads to death in up to 20% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harper-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 1986</LINK>) or to KP in 85% of survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>). Up to 25% of the latter group require long-term institutionalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Victor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 1989</LINK>). Furthermore, the incidence of KP has been reported to be rising in some parts of the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Ramayya-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramayya 1997</LINK>). For the reasons already mentioned, it is probable that WE is largely underdiagnosed, and so any published incidence and prevalence figures are likely to represent a considerable underestimation.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-25 15:16:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Chronic alcohol consumption, which is an important but not an exclusive cause of the disorder, does not necessarily result in WE if dietary thiamine intake is adequate (<LINK REF="REF-Sechi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sechi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCGCACC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGCACC 2010</LINK>). It may lead to thiamine deficiency through several potential mechanisms&#65293;genetic predisposition, replacement of vitamin-containing foods by the high calorific value of alcohol, impaired absorption of thiamine from the gut, impairment of storage by the liver, thiamine transport problems, other nutritional deficiencies, decreased phosphorylation to thiamine pyrophosphate and excessive requirements for the metabolism of alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Butterworth-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterworth 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2012</LINK>). Thiamine acts as a coenzyme in the metabolism of glucose and lipids, and, as stores of water-soluble vitamins are limited in the body, deficiency can present within 2 to 3 weeks of cessation of intake (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>). Oral preparations have been shown to vary in bioavailability (<LINK REF="REF-Greb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greb 1998</LINK>), but in hospital practise, thiamine is usually administered parenterally to patients thought to be at high risk of WKS. Parenteral administration is associated with some risk of anaphylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-29 03:07:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>This review will focus on WKS in the context of alcohol abuse, as this is by far the most common cause in the developed world, with 30% to 80% of alcohol abusers having clinical or biochemical signs of thiamine deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 1987</LINK>). Alcohol also appears to significantly increase the amount of thiamine required to treat the patient successfully compared with individuals in whom thiamine deficiency has a predominantly nutritional cause (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2008</LINK>). Despite evidence suggesting a high prevalence of unrecognised neuropathology due to thiamine deficiency, few studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of thiamine in alcohol abusers in a systematic way. Ataxia and eye movement abnormalities have been found to improve rapidly with administration of thiamine (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1952</LINK>), but the effects on memory in particular are far from clear. One review of the subject concludes that no formal dose-ranging, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted on the use of parenteral B-complex vitamins (including thiamine) in alcohol abuse before investigators could go on to advocate 'different (treatment) regimens for patients at risk of developing WE and those currently suffering from WE' (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-05-29 03:06:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Although WKS is reasonably well defined and is known to cause significant mortality and morbidity, the optimal treatment strategy is not clear. The role of thiamine in treating patients with some of the features of WKS has been frequently recorded, but recommendations about dosage and duration of treatment are acknowledged to be arbitrary. Is there clear evidence for the efficacy of thiamine in preventing and treating the features of WKS, and if so, in which form should it be given, at what dose and for how long? Is there a window of opportunity for treatment? This is an update of an earlier Cochrane review, which was originally published in 2004 and was last updated in 2008. This update involved an updated search of the literature and some revisions of background to incorporate developments in the field since the time of the original publication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of the studies</HEADING>
<P>Two independent review authors (ED and PWB) undertook a systematic examination of all references retrieved by the search. The two review authors independently selected trials assessing the effectiveness of thiamine in participants with or at risk of developing WKS as the result of alcohol abuse.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Both review authors (ED and PWB) independently extracted the data. Any disagreement was discussed and the decisions documented. Where necessary, attempts were made to contact the authors of the studies to help resolve the issue.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted the number of participants experiencing the event and the total number of participants in each arm of the trial. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD) in each arm of the trial, as well as the total number in each group. If final means and SDs were not reported, we extracted the mean and SD of change from baseline where available.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment before randomisation, but no longer than two months before.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance and whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who completed the trial were sought and were indicated as such.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of bias took into account the adequacy of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and any other potential sources of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed under the following headings:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment.</LI>
<LI>Blinding.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting.</LI>
<LI>Other biases.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rating scales</HEADING>
<P>A wide range of rating scales are available to measure the various aspects of global and domain-specific cognitive function (especially memory). These scales vary in quality, and many are poorly validated in this population (i.e. heavy drinkers). The review authors included data generated by the use of unpublished rating scales or scales without established reliability and validity but where relevant commented on their shortcomings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. When the rating scales used in the trials had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10), the data would have been treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>We expressed the results as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and as mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We planned to use the MD when pooled trials used the same rating scale or test, and the SMD (i.e. the absolute MD divided by the standard deviation (SD)) when different rating scales were used. The available data did not permit meta-analytical methods of data synthesis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>We intended to deal with any unit of analysis issues using guidance provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)</P>
<P>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis and assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference were to be presented. In all cases, the overall estimate from a fixed-effect model would have been presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic or the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic performed. If significant heterogeneity had been noted, a random-effects model would have been presented. If evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials had been found, then either only homogeneous results were to be pooled, or a random-effects model would have been used (in which case the CIs would have been broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>

<P>The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group trials register is the most comprehensive of its kind, and yet only two trials were found. A review of the reference lists of these articles and of other descriptive reviews of the management of WKS, as well as discussion with experts in the field, yielded no further controlled trials. Link Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of a commonly prescribed vitamin preparation containing thiamine, reported that the company had no records of relevant, randomised controlled trials on file. An author of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK>) was unable to furnish additional data, and attempts to contact an author of the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK>) were unsuccessful.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>We identified two studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review (<LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK>), one of which was unpublished. These studies involved a total of 177 participants, and both were randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. However, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK>) was very small (n = 8) and contained insufficient data for quantitative analysis.</P>
<P>Both studies involved participants with a history of chronic alcohol use. In <LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK>, participants were recruited by consecutive admissions to a 12-bed detoxification unit with 24-hour nursing cover. Participants had a mean age of 42 years, had been drinking for an average of 17 years and had consumed a mean of 303 g of alcohol per day at the time of admission. All conformed to a <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)</I> diagnosis of alcohol dependence but did not have the triad of acute symptoms associated with WKS. In <LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK>, participants were described as having a history of chronic alcohol abuse, but no information was given about the length or level of drinking history or how participants were recruited. All participants had evidence of baseline neuropsychological memory impairment, as defined by a Buschke Selective Reminding Test (Consistent Long-Term Recall and Delayed Recall (CLTR)) score of less than 90. No other indication of the manifestations of WKS was given.</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK> compared five doses of intramuscular thiamine hydrochloride (5, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mg) given once per day for two consecutive days. <LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK> compared 5 g per day of oral thiamine hydrochloride with a lactose placebo given for a period of two weeks.</P>
<P>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK>, participants were assessed individually on day 3 of treatment on the delayed alternation test by a psychologist blind to treatment allocation. Their blood alcohol levels were recorded as zero. <LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK> used a more extensive battery of cognitive measures at baseline and after two weeks of treatment.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-05-29 08:48:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Although the use of thiamine or thiamine-containing products for prophylaxis against and treatment of WKS in individuals who misuse alcohol is well established, only two small randomised controlled trials were identified by our search. Both studies selected different groups of participants within the WKS spectrum and adopted very different treatment strategies, and so it was not possible to combine data. Furthermore considerable methodological shortcomings were noted in both studies.</P>
<P>Ambrose et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK>) used the results of the delayed alternation test (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1986</LINK>) as the main outcome measure of working memory. However, because little information about the reliability of this test in humans is available, there is reason to doubt whether it has undergone adequate psychometric evaluation for the task. Furthermore, although we have extracted data from this study to compare higher doses of thiamine with the 5-mg/day dose, it should be noted that 19 participants were removed from the analyses to balance the baseline characteristics of the treatment groups. No report has described how this was done, and it would be very difficult in practise. It is an unnecessary procedure, and a better approach would have been to carry out an analysis of covariance with the relevant baseline characteristics as covariates. Assessment of further outcomes that covers other aspects of the syndrome, in addition to the one chosen, would have been desirable.<BR/>
<BR/>Nichols et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK>) used a wider range of neuropsychological tests, but their results were undermined by the small number of participants and limited reporting of data. Participants in the group treated with thiamine 5 g/day taken orally showed significant improvement on the Buschke CLTR and Delayed Recall when compared with baseline, but not on the COWA or MCG-D. Participants in the placebo group failed to show improvement on any measures. However, the article does not report the number of participants in each group, thus preventing quantitative analysis. The review was limited by inability to contact the authors to discuss this further.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-29 08:48:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ed Day">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-29 06:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ed Day">
<P>WKS is a fairly common condition, and effective recognition and treatment of this disorder have important human and economic consequences. The use of thiamine in the treatment of acute WKS is well established and is supported by a series of published case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Victor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCGCACC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGCACC 2010</LINK>). Such reports provide evidence of thiamine treatment bringing about rapid resolution of the ataxia and ophthalmoplegia (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1995</LINK>) and slow but significant improvement in the severity of nystagmus (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1995</LINK>). The global confusional state also appears to improve rapidly within hours of thiamine treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1995</LINK>), but other issues remain unresolved. Impairment of memory and learning responds more slowly and often incompletely, suggesting a different mechanism of effect. The two studies included in this review suggest a role for thiamine in treating memory and learning impairments, but neither answers the questions posed in the introduction to this review.</P>
<P>Available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to guide clinicians in the dose, frequency, route or duration of thiamine treatment for prophylaxis against or treatment of established WKS due to alcohol abuse. Current recommendations for best practise continue to be found in guided extrapolations from basic science and case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCGCACC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGCACC 2010</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-29 08:48:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>When the weight of evidence from clinical experience and case studies is considered, placebo-controlled trials of thiamine treatment in newly diagnosed WE are not ethically justifiable. However, it would be scientifically and ethically sound to randomly assign participants with established WKS to different parenteral dosing regimens for differing time periods, perhaps as part of a single trial in which a factorial design is used. The issue of prophylaxis for those at risk of developing WKS is less clear. In preparing evidence for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, an expert group of the National Clinical Guideline Centre for Acute and Chronic Conditions divided participants into groups at low and high risk of developing WE (<LINK REF="REF-NCGCACC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGCACC 2010</LINK>). The low-risk group was defined as 'people who are alcohol dependent but otherwise eating a normal diet and with no other alcohol-related problems'. Based on a systematic review of available evidence, the group noted that it could not recommend widespread use of thiamine in this group. Therefore it would be justified to randomly assign those at high risk of developing WE in a similar study with a factorial design, including an oral thiamine treatment arm and probably involving high doses. The high-risk group consists of people undertaking medically assisted withdrawal from alcohol (planned or unplanned) and those with alcohol-related liver disease, acute alcohol withdrawal, malnourishment or risk of malnourishment (i.e. weight loss in past year, reduced body mass index (BMI), loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting), acute illness or alcohol-related co-morbidity requiring hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-NCGCACC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGCACC 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>When such trials are designed, how the diagnosis of WKS is to be made should be clearly stated. The <LINK REF="STD-Ambrose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrose 2001</LINK> study focuses on a group without the classical triad of symptoms of WKS, but post-mortem and other data suggest that a much broader diagnostic strategy should be adopted (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caine-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caine 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Nichols-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Nichols unpublished</LINK> describes a group with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and evidence of neuropsychological memory impairment but does not describe the presence or absence of other symptoms of WKS.</P>
<P>Consideration must also be given to the best way of measuring outcomes in WKS, but no consensus has been reached in this area. This review has focused on memory impairment, mainly because it seems clear that WKS is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (<LINK REF="REF-Victor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victor 1989</LINK>), and study participants with non&#65293;alcohol-induced WKS have been reported to have a relatively pure amnestic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1990</LINK>). Memory impairment and the neurological manifestations of WKS are the problems most likely to respond to thiamine therapy. Evidence that the broader range of visuospatial and executive functions impaired by alcohol are caused by thiamine deficiency is less clear, although this remains a possibility (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1990</LINK>). If the focus is to be on memory impairment, the ideal cognitive battery should be sensitive to the impairment of consciousness associated with WE and to the learning and retrograde memory deficits associated with KP, as both are related to the thiamine deficiency state that treatment aims to correct. This battery ideally would be less sensitive to the enduring cognitive abnormalities arising more directly from chronic alcohol abuse, such as executive and visuospatial deficits, but would take into account that these abnormalities are also likely to be encountered in WE.</P>
<P>One barrier to effective treatment and prophylaxis appears to be concern about the risks of anaphylaxis when thiamine-containing preparations are administered parenterally (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 1997</LINK>). Therefore more research is needed to explore the potential clinical benefits of the reported increased bioavailability of lipid-soluble oral thiamine derivatives (<LINK REF="REF-Greb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greb 1998</LINK>) and to clarify the most useful measures of thiamine sufficiency and biological endpoints of treatment. A further important issue involves the timing of administration of thiamine relative to the course of alcohol abuse or dependence. Administration of thiamine treatment to patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal may also be influenced by other factors such as magnesium depletion (<LINK REF="REF-McLean-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 1999</LINK>), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor up-regulation or liver impairment, all of which may alter thiamine metabolism and utilization.</P>
