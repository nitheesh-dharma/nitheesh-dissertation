<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-10 14:57:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs, which can be taken by mouth (tablet) or by an injection (depot). Fluphenazine was one of the first antipsychotic to be produced in depot form. The depot comes in two forms (decanoate and enanthate). Depot injections are often used for people who refuse or forget to take tablets (showing poor compliance or adherence with medication). Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic drug that is very effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, when compared to newer antipsychotic drugs, fluphenazine may have serious side effects (such as involuntary shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness and the inability to sit still) and is known to lower people&#8217;s mood.</P>
<P>This review aimed to investigate the effects of fluphenazine (decanoate and enanthate) for schizophrenia. Searches for relevant randomised controlled trials was run in February 2011 and October 16, 2013. Authors could include and extract data from 73 studies with a total of 4870 participants. There were more studies on fluphenazine decanoate than enanthate.The review authors rated the quality of the evidence in the included trials to be low or very low. A long-term result from only one trial indicated fluphenazine decanoate reduces the rate of relapse when compared with placebo (&#8216;dummy treatment&#8217;). Three studies found that fluphenazine decanoate produced fewer general movement disorders than oral antipsychotics. However, other results showed, overall, the effects and outcomes, including adverse effects for fluphenazine (decanoate and enanthate) are similar to other oral and depot antipsychotics. Important outcomes and information about use of services, going into hospital, satisfaction with care and costs were not reported in any study.</P>
<P>Depot injections may offer an advantage over tablets (oral medication) in terms of people taking their medication (complying and adhering to treatment). However, this needs to be balanced with the likelihood of serious side effects, such as involuntary shaking, muscle stiffness, the inability to sit still and lowering in people&#8217;s mood. Results did not show any strong evidence that depot fluphenazine produced more adverse effects than other antipsychotics.</P>
<P>This should be addressed in future large scale and high quality studies.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reliably selected, assessed the quality, and extracted data of the included studies. For dichotomous data, we estimated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. We used the mean difference (MD) for normal continuous data. We excluded continuous data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%. Tests of heterogeneity and for publication bias were undertaken. We used a fixed-effect model for all analyses unless there was high heterogeneity. For this update. we assessed risk of bias of included studies and used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to create a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review now includes 73 randomised studies, with 4870 participants. Overall, the quality of the evidence is <I>low to very low</I>.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, use of fluphenazine decanoate does not result in any significant differences in death, nor does it reduce relapse over six months to one year, but one longer-term study found that relapse was significantly reduced in the fluphenazine arm (n = 54, 1 RCT, RR 0.35, CI 0.19 to 0.64, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). A very similar number of people left the medium-term studies (six months to one year) early in the fluphenazine decanoate (24%) and placebo (19%) groups, however, a two-year study significantly favoured fluphenazine decanoate (n = 54, 1 RCT, RR 0.47, CI 0.23 to 0.96, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). No significant differences were found in mental state measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or in extrapyramidal adverse effects, although these outcomes were only reported in one small study each. No study comparing fluphenazine decanoate with placebo reported clinically significant changes in global state or hospital admissions.</P>
<P>Fluphenazine decanoate does not reduce relapse more than oral neuroleptics in the medium term (n = 419, 6 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.75 to 2.83, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). A small study found no difference in clinically significant changes in global state. No difference in the number of participants leaving the study early was found between fluphenazine decanoate (17%) and oral neuroleptics (18%), and no significant differences were found in mental state measured on the BPRS. Extrapyramidal adverse effects were significantly less for people receiving fluphenazine decanoate compared with oral neuroleptics (n = 259, 3 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.24 to 0.91, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). No study comparing fluphenazine decanoate with oral neuroleptics reported death or hospital admissions.</P>
<P>No significant difference in relapse rates in the medium term between fluphenazine decanoate and fluphenazine enanthate was found (n = 49, 1 RCT, RR 2.43, CI 0.71 to 8.32, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), immediate- and short-term studies were also equivocal. One small study reported the number of participants leaving the study early (29% versus 12%) and mental state measured on the BPRS and found no significant difference for either outcome. No significant difference was found in extrapyramidal adverse effects between fluphenazine decanoate and fluphenazine enanthate. No study comparing fluphenazine decanoate with fluphenazine enanthate reported death, clinically significant changes in global state or hospital admissions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are more data for fluphenazine decanoate than for the enanthate ester. Both are effective antipsychotic preparations. Fluphenazine decanoate produced fewer movement disorder effects than other oral antipsychotics but data were of low quality, and overall, adverse effect data were equivocal. In the context of trials, there is little advantage of these depots over oral medications in terms of compliance but this is unlikely to be applicable to everyday clinical practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One in every 10,000 people per year are diagnosed with schizophrenia, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>). It often runs a chronic course with acute exacerbations and often partial remissions. The neuroleptic group of drugs is the mainstay treatment for this illness (<LINK REF="REF-Dencker-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dencker 1980</LINK>). These are generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling such symptoms as hallucinations and fixed false beliefs (delusions) (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1986</LINK>). They seem to reduce the risk of acute relapse.</P>
<P>Anti-psychotic drugs are usually given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Aaes_x002d_Jorgenson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaes-Jorgenson 1985</LINK>), but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. Problems with treatment adherence are common throughout medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979</LINK>). Those who suffer from long-term illness such as schizophrenia are less likely to take medication regularly if experiencing adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>), or if they experience cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-David-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1994</LINK>) and erosion of insight. The development of depot injections in the 1960s and initial clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1973b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1973b</LINK>) gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluphenazine was one of the first oral antipsychotics to be produced in a depot form. Two forms of the depot, a decanoate (Modecate) and an enanthate (Moditen) are available. The decanoate is more commonly prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 1990</LINK>) and lasts about four to six weeks in the body, while a single dose of the enanthate is shorter acting (one to three weeks). Evidence also suggests that the decanoate may produce slightly less adverse effects than its enanthate counterpart (<LINK REF="REF-Kurland-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurland 1970</LINK>). However, in comparison with newer depot formulations fluphenazine decanoate has been reported to cause greater extrapyramidal adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Knights-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Knights 1979</LINK>) and to significantly lower mood (<LINK REF="REF-De-Alarcon-1969a" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Alarcon 1969a</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depots mainly consist of an ester of the active drug held in an oily suspension. This is injected intramuscularly and is slowly released. Depots may be given every one to six weeks. Individuals may be maintained in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses, sometimes in clinics set up for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1994</LINK>). The use of depots eradicates covert non-compliance.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review undertaken over a decade ago suggested that, for those with serious mental illness, stopping anti-psychotics resulted in 58% of people relapsing, whereas only 16% of those who were still on the drugs became acutely ill within a one-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1986</LINK>). Evidence also points to the fact that experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia lowers a person's level of social functioning and quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Curson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Curson 1985</LINK>). Relapse prevention has also enormous financial implications. For example, within the UK, a Department of Health burden of disease analysis in 1996 indicated that schizophrenia accounted for 5.4% of all National Heath Service inpatient expenditure, placing it behind only learning disability and stroke in magnitude (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>For this update, review author NM extracted data from included studies and RA checked the data. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but only included if two review authors had the same results. When further information was necessary, we contacted authors of studies in order to obtain missing data or for clarification. No studies were multi-centre; had there been, we would have extracted data relevant to each component centre separately where possible.</P>

<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages to both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants in 'other tables' within the data and analyses section rather than into a statistical analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we entered such data from studies with over 200 participants into syntheses.</P>
<P>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not; we entered skewed change data into analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>).

<P>For this 2013 update, the Enhanced Reviews team used the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/H) statistic with its confidence intervals is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). Therefore, we did not present NNTs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments. Where trials reported mean data adjusted for baseline and standard error using ANCOVA, we entered this data using the generic inverse variance according to section 9.4.5.2 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the trials we included were cluster trials. Had there been, where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we would seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported we would have assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Some included studies used a cross-over design. A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>For the included studies with more than two treatment arms, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. Where data were binary, we simply added these and combined them within the two-by-two table. Where data were continuous we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P value or T value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we would calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies, even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses, unless there was high heterogeneity (see <LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>), in which case we used the random-effects model. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random-effects model.</P>

<P>The 2013 update search identified 44 potential studies and after screening we added four new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ju-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ju 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khazaie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Khazaie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenoy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shenoy 1981</LINK>) to the included studies. Two previously included studies, <LINK REF="REF-Marder-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1987</LINK>, were found to include the same participants, and so were added as the same study.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Length of trials</HEADING>
<P>The duration for all the studies ranged between two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1978</LINK>) to three years (<LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Participants</HEADING>
<P>The diagnoses of all participants were schizophrenia or some other similar psychotic disorder. Most of the studies included people of both sexes, although seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asarnow-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Asarnow 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurland-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kurland 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982</LINK>) included only men and 16 trials failed to mention the sex of participants. Ages ranged between 13 and 81 years, but most people were in the 18 to 65 age range. Most trial participants had long histories of schizophrenia, although many studies (n = 44) failed to mention the length of time people had been ill. Researchers frequently used operational criteria for diagnoses (RDC, Schneider's first rank symptoms, Hay &amp; Forrest 1972 criteria, PSE, Kraepelinian, ICD -9, DSM-II/III, Bleuler's criteria, <LINK REF="REF-Feighner-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feighner 1972</LINK> criteria, Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders and Huangshan council schizophrenia standard), although 31 (43%) trials did not specify which diagnostic criteria were used.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Setting</HEADING>
<P>The trials were both community- and hospital-based. People in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schooler-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schooler 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1984</LINK>) were given the first two injections whilst in hospital and after which medication continued to be administered in the community. Both <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1984</LINK> studied people initially in a hospital setting followed by a continuation in the community.

Ten studies compared fluphenazine decanoate with enanthate (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asarnow-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Asarnow 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donlon-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Donlon 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keskiner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Keskiner 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurland-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kurland 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacCrimmon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">MacCrimmon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Praag-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Van Praag 1973</LINK>). Fourteen studies compared fluphenazine esters with oral antipsychotics. Thirty-five trials compared fluphenazine decanoate or enanthate with other depot formulations. There were 10 dosage studies - nine comparing fluphenazine decanoate and one comparing fluphenazine enanthate (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1978</LINK>). Of the 73 included trials, 66 used fluphenazine decanoate as an intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.1.1 Global functioning</HEADING>
<P>a) Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is a three-item rating instrument commonly used in schizophrenia studies. It enables clinicians to quantify the severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery.</P>
<P>b) Global Assessment Scale - GAS (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is an observer-rated scale for evaluating the overall functioning of an individual during a specified time period on a continuum from psychological or psychiatric sickness to health. Score ranges from zero to 100, where a higher score indicates better functioning.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.1.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>a) Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Scores can range from zero to 126. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>b) Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale - CPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Asberg-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asberg 1978</LINK>)<BR/>The scale is designed to measure psychopathology over time via a clinical interview. It contains 67 items, including one global rating and one item documenting the reliability of the interview. The majority of the items (40) are based upon reported symptoms. Assumed reliability of the rating is scored as zero (very poor), one (fair), two (good) or three (very good).</P>
<P>c) Krawiecka Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Krawiecka-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krawiecka 1977</LINK>)<BR/>This mental state scale encompasses both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It is used to evaluate the mental state and behaviour in chronic psychotic people with higher scores indicating greater severity. It is also known as the Manchester Scale.</P>
<P>d) Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This scale allows a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia (impoverished thinking), affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, and attention impairment. Assessments are made on a six-point scale from zero (not at all) to five (severe). Higher scores indicate more symptoms.</P>
<P>e) Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking. Higher scores indicate more symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.1.3 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>a) Nurses Observational Scale of Inpatients Evaluation - NOSIE (<LINK REF="REF-Honigfeld-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honigfeld 1962</LINK>).<BR/>This is an 80-item scale with items rated on a five-point scale from zero (not present) to four (always present). Ratings are based on behaviour over the previous three days. The seven headings are social competence, social interest, personal neatness, co-operation, irritability, manifest psychosis and psychotic depression. The total score ranges from zero to 320 with high scores indicating a poor outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.1.4 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>a) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Side Effects Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is a 12-item scale designed to record the occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Ten items of this scale have been used to assess tardive dyskinesia, a long-term drug-induced movement disorder. A five-point scoring system (from zero - none to four - severe) has been used to rate each of the 10 items. Using this scale in short-term treatment may be helpful in assessing some short-term abnormal movement disorders. A low score indicates low levels of dyskinetic movements.</P>
<P>b) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale - DOTES (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This adverse effect tool seems less of a scale, where the degree and severity of a symptom is recorded, and more of a checklist. The DOTES seems to record the presence or absence of a list of adverse effects.</P>
<P>c) Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items), and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>d) Simpson and Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970b</LINK>)<BR/>The SAS is a 10-item scale, used to evaluate the presence and severity of drug-induced parkinsonian symptomatology. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a zero to four scale, with a scoring system of zero to four for each item. This scale is referred to as the RSESE in <LINK REF="STD-Ju-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ju 2000</LINK>. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism.</P>
<P>e) UKU Side Effects Rating Scale - UKU-SERS (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerde 1987</LINK>).<BR/>The UKU rates four major topics: psychological adverse effects (10 items), neurological adverse effects (eight items), autonomic adverse effects (11 items) and other adverse effects (19 items). Each item is defined by means of a four-point scale where zero means not present or doubtfully present. Scoring range zero to144.</P>
<P>f) Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale -TESS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This checklist assesses a variety of characteristics for each adverse event, including severity, relationship to the drug, temporal characteristics (timing after a dose, duration and pattern during the day), contributing factors, course, and action taken to counteract the effect. Symptoms can be listed a priori or can be recorded as observed by the investigator. High scores indicate worse symptoms.</P>
<P>g) Symptom Checklist 90 - SCL-90 (<LINK REF="REF-Derogatis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derogatis 1977</LINK>)<BR/>This is a self-report scale of physical symptoms.</P>
<P>h) Maryland Psychiatric Research Center Involuntary Movement Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Cassady-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassady 1997</LINK>)<BR/>The MPRC rates the severity of tardive dyskinesia. It gives a global rating of dyskinesia in 11 body areas and two ratings during gait. It is rated on an eight-point scale (zero to seven), with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.1.5 Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>a) Quality of life scale &#8211; QLS (<LINK REF="REF-Heinrich-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinrich 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This 21-item scale is based on a semi-structured interview providing information on symptoms and functioning during the preceding four weeks. There are seven severity steps (zero to six; six being adequately functioning and zero being deficient). Four item categories have been identified by factor analysis i) interpersonal relationships (seven items), ii) instrumental role (four items), iii) intrapsychic function (seven items) and iv) common place objects and activities. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were based mainly in the community, or combined both hospital and community settings. Ages ranged between 13 and 81 years, but most people were in the 18 to 65 age range. The duration of illness was long in most participants in the studies that reported this. Included trials were conducted around the world, although the majority (56) were based in North America and Europe and none were based in Australia or South America. There is a broad mixture of participants, settings and clinical applicability of the interventions which should increase generalisability.The dosages of fluphenazine decanoate and enanthate reflected current clinical practice. Outcomes were, however, limited. No trials reported data on service utilisation, hospital admission and economic outcomes. It is a shame that so few outcomes were included.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence is low to very low based on GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>). Although all studies were reported as randomised, only five reported the method of randomisation and another three the method of allocation concealment. For the majority of studies the method of blinding was not reported despite most stating that they were double blind. In 83% of studies, the risk of bias for selective reporting was rated as high; many pre-planned outcomes were not reported and continuous data were often reported as mean without standard deviation, only as P values, or graphically. Poor presentation of data meant that a lot of potentially informative data were lost.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-10-08 13:57:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A thorough search strategy was used in this review. There may still be gaps in the search strategy such as unpublished data (grey literature), which are difficult to obtain. Futhermore, when assessing the risk of bias of studies previously included in this review, we were unable to assess the risk of bias for one study in Italian. However, this study did not contribute to any outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables and therefore the omission of this one study did not affect the overall quality judgement.</P>
<P>For most outcomes we are not able to tell if there was publication bias, as no more than 10 trials reported data for these, and a funnel plot could not be performed. For leaving the study early in the comparison of fluphenazine decanoate versus oral neuroleptics, there does appear to be publication bias, as the funnel plot indicates that larger trials have not been performed.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>When compared with either placebo or oral neuroleptics, fluphenazine decanoate does not appear to have a clinically important effect in terms of improving relapse rates based on medium-term (six months to one year) data. Longer-term data, however, do support the use of fluphenazine decanoate to reduce relapse when compared to placebo, but not when compared to oral neuroleptics. Relapse data for fluphenazine enanthate were limited and no data comparing it with placebo or oral neuroleptics were available. Fluphenazine depot preparations, especially the decanoate, seem equivalent to oral medications and may even cause less adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>The data on the effects of fluphenazine decanoate are clearer than for fluphenazine enanthate. Within the highly unusual setting of a randomised trial, the decanoate may have some advantages over the oral antipsychotics. In clinical life there may be greater advantages in terms of compliance. There are no data to support the claim that depots cause more adverse effects than oral preparations. There are also no data to support the use of high doses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers or policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Studies did not report data relating to service utilisation and care management. Outcomes relating to use of hospitals and services, satisfaction with care and economics were not reported in any study. This deficiency remains and should be addressed in real world randomised studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Trialists involved in future studies should implement the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) to ensure that outcomes are more relevant. Inclusion of hospital and services outcomes, satisfaction with care and economic outcomes would provide valuable data for people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>A recurring failure to report the exact methodology of allocation was evident throughout the included trials. Only five studies stated the randomisation process used; <LINK REF="STD-Kissling-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kissling 1985</LINK> used a coin-throwing method, <LINK REF="STD-Frangos-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Frangos 1978</LINK> a randomisation code, <LINK REF="STD-Magnus-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Magnus 1979</LINK> a pre-arranged prescribing list, and <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1984</LINK> a randomisation list and <LINK REF="STD-Leong-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leong 1989</LINK> allocated to the next available study number. Allocation concealment is essential to ensure that selection bias is kept to a minimum. </P>
<P>Only 14 studies described outcome assessors as being blinded to treatment and were rated low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frangos-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Frangos 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leong-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leong 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClelland-1976" TYPE="STUDY">McClelland 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Odejide-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Odejide 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Praag-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Van Praag 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Praag-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Van Praag 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Magnus-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Magnus 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1978</LINK> were open label trials and <LINK REF="STD-Leong-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leong 1989</LINK> described using a 'partially-blinded' method where only outcome assessors were blinded. The remaining studies were of unclear risk of bias as no information on blinding of outcome assessors was provided. Although most studies were stated to be double blind, only 14 studies described outcome assessors as being blinded to treatment and were rated low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frangos-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Frangos 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leong-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leong 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClelland-1976" TYPE="STUDY">McClelland 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Odejide-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Odejide 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Praag-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Van Praag 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Praag-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Van Praag 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>). This is an important strategy for avoiding performance and detection bias. <LINK REF="STD-Odejide-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Odejide 1982</LINK> included participants who were unaccounted for after randomisation was undertaken. This study did not specify from which groups this withdrawal had occurred. In 12 trials the number of people who left the study was not reported. It is important to know how many, and from which groups, people were withdrawn in order to evaluate exclusion bias. Studies included both community-based and hospitalised people but 16 failed to report the setting (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feng-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Feng 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hranov-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hranov 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kissling-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kissling 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kreisman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kreisman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKane-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McKane 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Odejide-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Odejide 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quitkin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Quitkin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlosberg-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Schlosberg 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>). A few studies, all using fluphenazine decanoate as an intervention, involved people in hospital at the beginning of the trial but these people were later discharged into the community (<LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donlon-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Donlon 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnus-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Magnus 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rifkin-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rifkin 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schooler-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schooler 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schooler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schooler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1984</LINK>). More community-based studies would be welcome.</P>
<P>This review highlights the need for good controlled clinical trials to address the effects of fluphenazine decanoate and fluphenazine enanthate and to assess their clinical suitability in certain situations. Despite the many studies that are in existence, we do think that more studies are required in each category but particularly in the case of fluphenazine enanthate where data were particularly few. We realise that such design needs a great deal of planning but suggest a simple outline in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Study selection</B>
<BR/>In the original review, all the studies we identified were inspected by the principal reviewer (SQ). A randomly selected sample of 10% of all reports was re-inspected by AD in order to ensure selection was reliable. Where disagreement occurred, we resolved this by discussion, where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once we had obtained the full articles, SQ and AD independently decided whether they met the review criteria. We resolved disagreement by discussion and when this was not possible sought further information. We added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information. For the updated version of this review, JR inspected and data extracted all studies.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Again, we resolved disputes by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to clarify which category to allocate a trial to, we did not enter data and allocated the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. We included only trials in Category A or B in the review.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Data collection</B>
<BR/>In the first version of this review SQ and AD independently extracted data from selected trials. JR did this for the updated version. Again, we resolved disputes by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added this outcome of the trial to the list of those await<B>i</B>ng assessment.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>4.1 Incomplete data.<BR/>Where more than 30% of those randomised were lost to follow-up by six months, or 50% by beyond that time, we felt data to be too prone to bias and did not used these outcomes.</P>
<P>4.2 Dichotomous - yes/no - data.<BR/>4.2.1 Statistics: For binary outcomes, for example, 'admitted' or 'not admitted', we estimated a Relative Risk with 95% confidence interval. Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) taking into account the event rate in the control group.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Intention-to-treat: We present data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis. Those who were lost to follow-up are all assumed to have the negative outcome, with the exception of death, which was coded separately. For example, for the outcome of relapse, we considered those who were lost to follow-up all to have relapsed.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Data reporting</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous - scale - data<BR/>4.3.1 Normal data: Mental health continuous data are often not 'normally' distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: i. standard deviations and means had to be reported in the paper or had to be obtainable from the authors; ii. when a continuous outcome started from a finite number (such as 0), the standard deviation, when multiplied by 2, had to be less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). We did not enter data not meeting the second standard into the RevMan calculator (which assumes a normal distribution). However, data not meeting these standards can be reported in the 'Other data types' of the results section if they have been analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests. If continuous data were recording change, where the finite parameters of the measure were unclear, the reviewers decided whether the data were usable or not.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or are ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. They could be that: i. the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; ii. not written or modified by one of the trialists; iii. the instrument should either be: (a) a self report, or (b) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist); and iv. the instrument should be a global assessment of an area of functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.3.3 Endpoint versus change data: where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported the former in this review.</P>
<P>4.3.4 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but would have adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>5. Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We then used visual inspection of graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate these data, but presented them separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity. Data were presented using a fixed-effect model for homogeneous data and a random-effects model for heterogeneous data.</P>
<P>
<B>6. Tables and figures</B>
<BR/>Where possible we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the fluphenazine esters.</P>
