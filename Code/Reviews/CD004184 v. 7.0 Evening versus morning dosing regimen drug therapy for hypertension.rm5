<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:14:01 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Elevated blood pressure is an important public health problem and once daily dosing regimen with blood pressure lowering drugs are recommended to reduce risk of strokes and heart attacks. This review examined the administration-time-related effects of once-daily evening versus morning regimen on death, cardiovascular outcomes and blood pressure reduction. The interventions included chronotherapeutic delivery formulations and conventional antihypertensive agents. 21 trials, involving 1,993 patients with primary hypertension were identified. We concluded that evening dosing with antihypertensive drugs had a slightly better blood pressure control than the morning dosing regimen in 24-hour BP, but its effect on death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is not known.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:32:24 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:14:08 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Elevated blood pressure or hypertension (defined as resting blood pressure levels of 140/90 mm Hg or more) is estimated to affect 20% of the adult population in both developed and developing countries. It is associated with an increased risk of death, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).</P>
<P>Six main classes of antihypertensive drugs are used worldwide: diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (BBs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and alpha-adrenergic antagonists. It is a well known fact that variation in blood pressure levels display circadian rhythms. The morning surge in blood pressure is known to increase the risk of myocardial events in the first several hours post awakening. WHO recommends using once daily long acting antihypertensive drugs, since they provide a more consistent 24-hour BP control, reduce BP variability, and improve adherence to therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Guidelines-Subcommittee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guidelines Subcommittee 1999</LINK>). Antihypertensive drugs are<B> </B>traditionally administered either as monotherapy or in combinations in the morning upon arising from bed. This is mainly because this approach has been applied in the vast majority of outcome trials that showed benefits of treatment in reducing the risk of CVD. Another important reason is that a once-daily morning regimen improves patients' adherence to the long-term treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Chobanian-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chobanian 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Waeber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waeber 1999</LINK>). However, the administration-time-effects of evening versus morning dosing regimen of antihypertensive drugs on clinically relevant outcomes such as death and cardiovascular outcomes in the management of patients with primary hypertension has not been studied in a systematic review.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:09:25 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>In this review, the conventional or routine administration of antihypertensive drug therapy for essential hypertension means dosing in the morning upon arising from bed. The traditional antihypertensive agents include long acting medications or the conventional (so-called homeostatically formulated) drugs administered without regard to BP circadian rhythm. They differ from chronotherapeutic formulations which are specially designed to provide peak plasma concentrations during the early morning hours when BP rises to peak and provide lower concentrations at night (<LINK REF="REF-Smolensky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smolensky 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chronotherapeutics is defined as the purposeful timing of medications, whether or not they utilize special drug release technology, to proportion serum and tissue concentrations in synchrony with known circadian rhythms in disease processes and symptoms as a means of enhancing beneficial outcomes and/or attenuating or averting adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Smolensky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smolensky 1996</LINK>). The chronotherapy of hypertension specifically entails significant attenuation of the accelerated morning rise of SBP and DBP and this may be achieved through the use of special drug-delivery technology (<LINK REF="REF-Smolensky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smolensky 2005</LINK>) or by changing the dosing timing of conventional BP-lowering medications (<LINK REF="REF-Hermida-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hermida-2005e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida 2005e</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a valuable technique to determine antihypertensive efficacy both in clinical practice and in research settings (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1991</LINK>). The use of such monitoring makes it feasible to follow the time course of BP variation around the clock in large groups of subjects. Compared with traditional resting BP measurement, it allows the assessment of duration of action of antihypertensive agents and compensates for most of the limitations of office determinations (<LINK REF="REF-Hermida-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida 1999</LINK>). It also makes it possible to exclude pharmacotherapy in patients who have white coat hypertension, and allows the evaluation of the consistency of the antihypertensive effect of new drug-chronotherapeutic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Canter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canter 1994</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:23:11 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Blood pressure (BP) varies throughout the day, has a distinct and reproducible 24-hour circadian rhythm in both normotensive and uncomplicated hypertensive patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hermida-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-White-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>). In patients who are awake during the daytime and asleep during the nighttime, their BP and HR have showed a typical circadian variation, with lower BP levels during nighttime sleep and an abrupt rise upon arising in the morning (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-White-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-White-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>). This pattern is rapidly reversed when individuals work night shifts and sleep during the day (<LINK REF="REF-Sunderg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderg 1988</LINK>). It was previously reported that the morning BP surge upon arising from bed appeared to parallel the morning surge in the incidence of cardiovascular events and was significantly associated with a greater target organ damage and higher cardiovascular events risk (<LINK REF="REF-Kario-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kario 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kuwajima-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuwajima 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Muller-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-White-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2001</LINK>). Based on this rationale, it is hypothesized that antihypertensive medication targeted for early morning BP control in addition to providing 24-hour BP control would result in a significant reduction of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. In other words, the medication is considered to lower BP consistently as well as reduce excessive peaks in pressure that may pose an additional cardiovascular risk.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:32:24 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Based on the above mentioned relationship, researchers began to apply the science of chronotherapeutics, or timing of drug effect to the treatment of essential hypertension to improve cardiovascular outcomes. A number of studies investigated the administration-time-dependent antihypertensive efficacy, e.g. ACEIs such as ramipril (<LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2009a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Myburgh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Myburgh 1995</LINK>), trandolapril (<LINK REF="STD-Kuroda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kuroda 2004</LINK>), perindopril (<LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1997</LINK>), and quinapril (<LINK REF="STD-Palatini-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Palatini 1992</LINK>); CCBs such as diltiazem (<LINK REF="STD-Glasser-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasser 2003</LINK>), nifedipine (<LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2009b</LINK>), cilnidipine (<LINK REF="STD-Kitahara-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kitahara 2004</LINK>), nisoldipine (<LINK REF="STD-White-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">White 1999a</LINK>) and amlodipine (<LINK REF="STD-Nold-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nold 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2003</LINK>); diuretics such as torasemide (<LINK REF="STD-Calvo-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 2006a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2008a</LINK>); ARBs such as valsartan (<LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2005b</LINK>), telmisartan (<LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2007a</LINK>), and olmesartan (<LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2009</LINK>); &#945;-blockers such as doxazosin <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2004</LINK>). A few clinical trials had found that nighttime dosing was more effective than morning administration to optimize morning BP control while maintaining 24-hour efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Glasser-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasser 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-2004" TYPE="STUDY">White 2004</LINK>), but another trial found no difference in morning SBP between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004</LINK>). One large trial compared verapamil versus atenolol or HCTZ on reduction of BP and cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="STD-Black-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study in hypertensive rats showed that dosing an ACE inhibitor, trandolapril, at night, had a better organ protective effect than dosing in the morning (<LINK REF="REF-Sugimoto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugimoto 2001</LINK>). Clinical trials have been performed in hypertensive patients by changing the time of dosing from morning to evening to enhance their effectiveness on cardiovascular outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Fujimura-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujimura 1999</LINK>). There are also a few non-systematic or traditional reviews focusing on this issue <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="REF-Ezeugo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezeugo 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hermida-2007C" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida 2007C</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hermida-2007d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida 2007d</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ohmori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohmori 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Stergiou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stergiou 2007</LINK>), some of which reported that nighttime administration of antihypertensive drugs had a larger blood pressure lowering effect during nighttime and the early morning hours. There is considerable evidence that the morning administration gives its full effect during daytime activities and a lesser effect during nighttime and the early morning hours, whereas bedtime administration has a larger effect during nighttime and the early morning hours. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to confirm these findings. It might be argued that bedtime administration should be considered as an alternative strategy that has the potential benefits to provide more effective cardiovascular protection. </P>

<P>All titles and the abstracts resulting from the search strategies were screened independently by two reviewers (Xu Ping and Zhao Ping). Articles were rejected on initial screening if they clearly did not meet the pre-specified inclusion criteria. The full text of the remaining articles were then retrieved and translated to English where required. The bibliographies of pertinent articles, reviews and texts were searched for additional citations. Studies which met the inclusion criteria were examined in detail. Reasons for excluding any study were documented. Trials with more than one publication were counted only once. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by discussion, and when necessary by a third reviewer (Wan Chaomin or Wang Zhengrong).

<P>Data was extracted independently by two reviewers Xu Ping and Zhao Ping using a standard form and then cross-checked. The differences in interpretation of data were resolved through further examination and consensus between the reviewers. If data were presented in tables, text or in figures, the numeric data were preferred because of possible measurement error when estimating from graphs. The data extracted from each study included patient characteristics, methods, interventions, outcomes and notes as mentioned in the table of included studies. All data, regardless of compliance or completion of follow up, was collected in order to allow for an intention to treat analysis.</P>
<P>In the case of missing information in the included studies, investigators were contacted by email to obtain the missing information. In the case of missing values for standard deviation of the change in blood pressure, the standard deviation was imputed based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same class of drug. The following hierarchy (listed from high to low preference) was used to impute standard deviation values:</P>

<P>For evaluation of the primary outcomes (mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and adverse events), data on the total number of patients with at least one event within each trial was to be extracted and comparisons between groups would be presented as relative risk ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. However, this was not done as none of the included trials reported any of these outcome measures.</P>
<P>Nine crossover RCTs that were included provided data on SBP and DBP. The data were obtained from texts, figures and tables. These data were entered using generic inverse variance. Subsequently for all other parallel group RCTs' blood pressure data were entered in a similar manner.</P>
<P>For parallel trials, we assessed the tolerability of the intervention by calculating the risk ratio (RR) of adverse events in the evening administration as compared to morning administration treatment arms. Random effects model was used to calculate a pooled risk ratio. Crossover trials are designed with the intention that all participants receive both the active and control interventions, and the treatment effect is estimated from the differences in response of the same participant to the different treatments. Hence participants who withdraw from either treatment cannot be included in the analysis and so the question of differential withdrawal between treatment arms does not arise.<BR/>

<P>In general if there were missing data, the authors of the study were contacted using e-mail for clarification. In cases where missing information was ultimately not available, the best estimate was included based on information in the same trial or information from other trials using the same class of drug. For instance, if standard error of the change for blood pressure was not provided, the value was imputed using the pooled standard error of change data from other similar trials and by calculating a weighted pooled standard error.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-15 17:01:51 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>No eligible studies evaluated mortality or morbidity for the six traditional antihypertensive drug classes morning versus evening once daily monotherapy regimens.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in overall adverse effects and withdrawals due to adverse effects among the two dosing regimens. Subgroup analysis of overall adverse events found no differences with ACEIs, CCBs and diuretic drug class evening versus morning dosing regimen; for the withdrawal profile, similar results were found with ACEIs, ARBs and CCBs between the two dosing regimens.</P>
<P>This review provided very limited morning BP data for beta-blockers and CCBs. Adverse events data (ACEIs, CCBs and diuretics) and withdrawals due to adverse effect (ACEIs, ARBs and CCBs) were reported, but no serious adverse events data for all the six conventional class antihypertensive agents were reported.</P>
<P>In a subgroups analysis of 24-hour SBP, no differences were found for beta-blockers, ACEIs, ARBs and CCBs evening versus morning dosing regimen. Statistically significant differences were found between evening versus morning dosing regimen for two drug classes, alpha-blockers (limited to one trial data <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2004</LINK>) and diuretics (limited to 2 trials <LINK REF="STD-Calvo-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hermida-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Hermida 2008a</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-08-15 17:12:55 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Most trials had risks of bias in at least two of several key criteria. One trial had risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Glasser-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glasser 2003</LINK>). See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>
</P>
<P>Nineteen of the 21 included studies were double-blind, involving 97% (N=1,928) of the entire studied population. Fifteen trials reported adequate sequence generation. However, only one trial reported adequate concealment of allocation [N=205, 11% (205/1993) of total randomized participants], so the number of patients randomized with adequate concealment of allocation was very low.</P>
<P>Three of the 21 included studies had incomplete outcome data. However, risk of bias due to selective reporting was found in 19 of the 21 included studies had a bias. </P>
<P>Thirteen trials (N=1729, 87%) had no other bias.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-15 17:24:04 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-15 17:20:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Based on data for 6 classes of antihypertensive drugs, evening administration lowered 24-hour SBP by 1.61 mm Hg and 24-hour DBP by 1.23 mm Hg. In particular the alpha-blocker doxazosin GITS (4 mg/day) and the diuretic torasemide (5 mg/day) evening administration reduced 24-hour SBP by 5.10 and 6.24 mm Hg respectively and 24-hour DBP by 2.70 and 5.95 mm Hg respectively. The clinical relevance of this decrease is not known, since very limited data has been reported for morning SBP and DBP, and mortality and morbidity data have not been reported. There were no significant differences in overall adverse effects and withdrawals due to adverse effects among the two regimens.</P>
<P>This systematic review found that nighttime dosing of antihypertensive drugs is more effective than morning administration to lower 24-hour BP, but did not find adequate data to determine which of the two regimens may have more beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes or adverse events.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-15 17:24:04 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>The short-term trials conducted to date, which report the mean BP lowering efficacy as a surrogate outcome, are not adequate to establish which of the two dosing regimens may be better. Large double-blind randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the administration time-related -effects of different antihypertensive drug classes given as monotherapy or as first line drugs with stepped up therapy on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, with long-term follow up data of at least 3 to 5 years duration.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2011-08-15 17:27:15 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>The title was changed to better reflect the objective of the review.</P>
<P>The protocol did not state that randomized cross-over trials would be included. This type of trial was included in the systematic review as it was thought that properly done randomized cross-over RCTs would add to the knowledge of the effects of evening versus conventional morning dosing regimen on blood pressure profile and cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
<P>Li Bingyan was a co-author of the protocol but was unable to participate in the conduct of the full review, therefore his name does not appear in the list of authors.</P>
