<TITLE>Birth control pills with three phases versus one phase</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-16 21:53:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Side effects of birth control pills may keep women from using them as planned. Attempts to decrease side effects led to the three-phase pill in the 1980s. Pills with three phases provide different amounts of hormones over three weeks. One-phase pills have the same amount of hormone for three weeks. Whether three-phase pills lead to more pregnancies is unknown. Nor is it known if the pills give better cycle control or fewer side effects. This review looked at whether three-phase pills worked as well as one-phase pills. It also studied whether women had fewer side effects with these pills.</P>
<P>We did a computer search for studies of pills with three phases versus pills with one phase in May 2011. We also wrote to researchers and manufacturers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in any language. The studies had to follow women for at least three treatment cycles.</P>
<P>We found 23 trials that looked at three-phase versus one-phase birth control pills. Many studies did not have good methods and the authors did not always report all their methods. The two types of pills did not differ in the numbers of women who got pregnant. About half of the trials found better bleeding patterns with the three-phase pill. The numbers of women who stopped using the pills were about the same for both types of pills.</P>
<P>The evidence was not strong enough to say whether the three-phase pill was better than the one-phase pill for pregnancy prevention, bleeding patterns, or continued use. Therefore, we recommend one-phase pills for women starting to use birth control pills. Large trials that are of good quality are needed to see if pills with three phases work better than those with one phase.</P>

<P>Side effects of oral contraceptive (OC) pills discourage adherence to and continuation of OC regimens. Strategies to decrease adverse effects led to the introduction of the triphasic OC in the 1980s. Whether triphasic OCs have higher accidental pregnancy rates than monophasic pills is unknown. Nor is it known if triphasic pills give better cycle control and fewer side effects than the monophasic pills.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare triphasic OCs with monophasic OCs in terms of efficacy, cycle control, and discontinuation due to side effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-19 09:36:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We searched the computerized databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, POPLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)) in May 2011. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted researchers and pharmaceutical companies to identify other trials not found in our search.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any triphasic OC with any monophasic pill used to prevent pregnancy. Interventions had to include at least three treatment cycles.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-19 09:39:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the studies found in the literature searches for possible inclusion and for their methodological quality. We contacted the authors of all included studies and of possibly randomized trials for supplemental information about the methods used and outcomes studied. We entered the data into RevMan and calculated odds ratios for the outcome measures of efficacy, breakthrough bleeding, spotting, withdrawal bleeding and discontinuation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-16 21:53:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of 23 trials included, 19 examined contraceptive effectiveness. The triphasic and monophasic preparations did not differ significantly. About half of the included trials reported favorable bleeding patterns, that is less spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea, in triphasic versus monophasic OC users. However, meta-analysis was generally not possible due to differences in measuring and reporting the cycle disturbance data as well as differences in progestogen type and hormone dosages. No significant differences were found in the numbers of women who discontinued due to medical reasons, cycle disturbances, intermenstrual bleeding or adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:54:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether triphasic OCs differ from monophasic OCs in effectiveness, bleeding patterns or discontinuation rates. Therefore, we recommend monophasic pills as a first choice for women starting OC use. Large, high-quality RCTs that compare triphasic and monophasic OCs with identical progestogens are needed to determine whether triphasic pills differ from monophasic OCs. Future studies should follow the recommendations of Belsey or Mishell on recording menstrual bleeding patterns and the CONSORT reporting guidelines.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-19 09:44:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Side effects of oral contraceptive pills discourage adherence to and continuation of oral contraceptive regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1998</LINK>). Three approaches have been used to decrease these adverse effects. These are (a) reduction of the steroid dose; (b) development of new steroids; and (c) new formulas and schedules of administration. These strategies led to the introduction of the triphasic oral contraceptive pill in the 1980s.</P>
<P>Triphasic oral contraceptives allegedly attempt to 'mimic' the rising and falling of estrogen and progesterone levels during the normal menstrual cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Upton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upton 1983</LINK>). This purportedly results in a more 'physiologic' approach and, with some pills, a lower total monthly steroid dosage compared to the older monophasic oral contraceptives. Possible benefits of the triphasic approach are better cycle control and fewer side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Guillebaud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillebaud 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hale-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 1987</LINK>). In a cohort study conducted in France, women using 30 to 40 &#956;g pills had similar reports of menstrual symptoms regardless of whether the pills were monophasic, biphasic or triphasic (<LINK REF="REF-Moreau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreau 2007</LINK>). However, potential disadvantages include an increased risk of pill-taking errors caused by the array of different colored pills, the higher price of the pills and the possible higher incidence of accidental pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Guillebaud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillebaud 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Soon after the introduction in Britain of Logynon, a triphasic preparation of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, two case reports described a probable method failure of the pill (<LINK REF="REF-Fay-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fay 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1982</LINK>). Studies at abortion clinics in Australia and the Netherlands demonstrated a significant over-representation of triphasic oral contraceptives used by women with an unplanned pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Ketting-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ketting 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1989</LINK>). Whether triphasic oral contraceptives have higher accidental pregnancy rates than monophasic oral contraceptives is unknown. Nor is it known if triphasic contraceptive pills give better cycle control and fewer side effects than the monophasic pills.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-19 09:46:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to compare triphasic oral contraceptive pills with monophasic oral contraceptive pills. Based on observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ketting-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ketting 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1989</LINK>), the a priori hypotheses were: (a) triphasic oral contraceptives are less effective in preventing pregnancy compared to monophasic oral contraceptives; and (b) triphasic oral contraceptives are similar to monophasic pills in terms of cycle control and continuation rates.</P>

<P>We reviewed the reference lists of identified studies for additional trials. For the initial review, we examined the references lists from relevant book chapters and review articles identified with the search strategies. We searched the holdings of the Family Health International (FHI) library for relevant trials, book chapters and review articles. In addition, we attempted to contact the authors of all included trials. We also wrote a letter to pharmaceutical companies in the USA and Europe that market oral contraceptives. In the contact letters, we provided a list of studies identified and asked if they knew of unpublished or published trials we had missed.</P>

By study, the effects were in different directions. The trials may have used different definitions of bleeding problems since neither provided clear information. Therefore, we divided two meta-analyses into two separate analyses. When the studies were examined separately, <LINK REF="STD-Lachnit_x002d_Fixson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lachnit-Fixson 1984</LINK> showed that the triphasic group had fewer cycles with spotting (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.44) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>) and with breakthrough bleeding (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.9</LINK>) than the monophasic group.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Contraceptive effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>The 23 comparative trials included in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether the contraceptive effectiveness of triphasic oral contraceptives differs from that of monophasic oral contraceptives. Pooling of the data on contraceptive effectiveness in a meta-analysis was generally not possible due to differences in (a) progestogen type and (b) dosage of estrogen or progestogen of the studied oral contraceptives. The sample sizes of the individual trials were too small to detect differences in contraceptive effectiveness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cycle control</HEADING>
<P>About half of the trials included in this review reported favorable bleeding patterns, that is less spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea, in triphasic oral contraceptive users compared to monophasic OC users (<LINK REF="STD-Andrade-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruni-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bruni 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlborg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carlborg 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hampton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kashanian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lachnit_x002d_Fixson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lachnit-Fixson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reiter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reiter 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sulak 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1979</LINK>). Combining menstrual bleeding data in a meta-analysis was generally not possible due to (a) differences between the trials in measuring, analyzing and reporting the data on cycle disturbances, and (b) differences in progestogen type, progestogen dosage and estrogen dosage of the studied contraceptive pills. When interpreting the findings on menstrual bleeding, consideration should be paid to the limitations of the studies. In most trials that reported favorable bleeding patterns in triphasic pill users compared to monophasic pill users, the progestogen type differed between the studied triphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives (<LINK REF="STD-Andrade-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruni-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bruni 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hampton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lachnit_x002d_Fixson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lachnit-Fixson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reiter-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reiter 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sulak 1999</LINK>). The progestogen type is thought to affect cycle control, so the differences in bleeding pattern might be partially explained by the differences in progestogen content (<LINK REF="REF-Maitra-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maitra 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1992</LINK>). Further, several trials used the proportion of all cycles with spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea as an effect measure (<LINK REF="STD-Andrade-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlborg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carlborg 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hampton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zador-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Zador 1979</LINK>). This measure might give a distorted impression as one does not know whether a few women had all the cycles with bleeding problems or lots of women had a few cycles with bleeding problems.</P>
<P>The proportion of women that discontinued due to bleeding problems is as an indicator of how women tolerated the bleeding pattern. No significant differences were found in the number of women who discontinued due to intermenstrual bleeding and cycle disturbances.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other adverse events</HEADING>
<P>This review did not focus on the incidence of minor adverse events of oral contraceptives like headache, nausea, breast pain and acne. Women may vary in their acceptability of the various minor side effects, so the clinical importance of incidence differences is difficult to assess. We considered discontinuation from the trial as a 'surrogate' outcome for the acceptability of the contraceptive method. No significant differences were observed in the number of women who discontinued due to side effects. The findings on discontinuation may not reflect usage of oral contraceptives in the 'real world'. Participants of prospective comparative trials are not likely to represent the general population of contraceptive users. Free provision of contraceptive methods, financial allowance and regular follow-up visits all may encourage continuation of the method.</P>
<P>The risk of serious adverse events of oral contraceptives like venous thromboembolism or myocardial infarction was not a subject of our review. Due to the low incidence of these adverse events, the randomized controlled trial does not suit evaluation of the absolute or relative risks. Observational studies, for example case-control studies and cohort studies, are more appropriate to assess these risks. No difference in the risk of venous thromboembolism between triphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel was observed in a recent case-control study (<LINK REF="REF-van-Hylckama-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Hylckama 2009</LINK>).</P>

Of 23 trials, 15 were unblinded and 17 studies excluded participants after randomization. Several studies excluded participants because of incorrect pill intake. Bias may result from non-random methods of generating the allocation sequence, inadequate allocation concealment, not blinding the participants or outcome assessors and exclusion of participants after randomization (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002e</LINK>).

This reflects the generally poor quality of comparative trials to date. Given the often higher cost and greater complexity of triphasic-pill regimens, monophasic pills should be the first choice in oral contraceptives. According to guidelines of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), women should start on a monophasic pill containing 30 to 35 &#956;g of estrogen (<LINK REF="REF-IPPF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPPF 2004</LINK>). Pills with 20 &#956;g estrogen cause more breakthrough bleeding and discontinuation because of bleeding than do pills with more estrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 2008</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-19 12:35:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large, adequately reported, high-quality, randomized controlled trials comparing triphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with identical progestogens are needed to determine whether triphasic pills differ from monophasic pills in contraceptive effectiveness, menstrual bleeding pattern and continuation rates. Combining the data on menstrual bleeding was complicated by the lack of uniformity in measuring, analyzing and reporting menstrual patterns. Recommendations for the standardization of the collection and analysis of bleeding data for combined hormonal contraceptive clinical trials have been published by <LINK REF="REF-Belsey-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsey 1986</LINK> and by <LINK REF="REF-Mishell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 2007</LINK>. Future studies should follow these recommendations to allow comparison of bleeding data. Further, reporting of the study methods and the methodological quality of the studies was poor. Future studies should adhere to the CONSORT guidelines on reporting of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>).</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Principal outcome measures are: pregnancy; side effects; cycle control; discontinuation and reasons for discontinuation. Use of a daily diary card to collect data on pill intake, cycle control, side effects and concomitant medication. Spotting was defined as a light flow that did not require sanitary protection; breakthrough bleeding as a heavier flow, similar to normal menstrual flow, that required sanitary protection; withdrawal bleeding as bleeding or spotting that began during the drug-free interval and stopped by day 4 of the next cycle; intermenstrual bleeding as all other bleeding or spotting; and an amenorrheic cycle as one with no withdrawal bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding. Report describes the results of 4 cycles of exposure. In the article there is a discrepancy in the number of pregnancies. Communication with the authors revealed that one participant in the monophasic group became pregnant before the start of the study.</P>

<P>Primary outcomes are: pregnancy; cycle control, side effects; laboratory changes; body weight; vital signs; changes in physical examination. Use of daily diary cards to collect data on pill-intake, cycle control and side effects. Data on side effects were recorded if reported in response to a general question or observed during physical examination. In the original article the recommendations by <LINK REF="REF-Belsey-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsey 1986</LINK> were used for analyzing bleeding patterns. Breakthrough bleeding was defined as bleeding that requires sanitary protection of more than one pad or tampon per day and occurs during the active tablet-taking interval but is not contiguous with menses. Breakthrough spotting was defined as bleeding that requires one or less pad or tampon during the active tablet-taking interval but is not contiguous with menses. The definition of amenorrhea was two consecutive cycles without any bleeding or spotting. In a secondary article the bleeding data were re-analyzed with the new recommendations by <LINK REF="REF-Mishell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 2007</LINK>. Unscheduled bleeding was defined as any bleeding that occurs while taking active hormones, regardless of the duration of the regimen, with the exception of bleeding that begins during the hormone-free interval and continues through days 1-4 of the subsequent active cycle and bleeding reported during days 1-7 of the first cycle of combined hormonal contraceptive therapy. The definition of amenorrhea was absence of all bleeding or spotting. A third article examined bleeding patterns by age and weight subgroups.

<P>The report does not provide an a priori hypothesis. The paper states that the sample size was determined to meet the US regulatory requirements of at least 10,000 cycles for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of oral contraceptives with at least 200 participants evaluated for 13 cycles. Study duration: 6 and 13 cycles. In the group of participants enrolled for a trial period of 6 cycles, 258 women taking triphasic pills and 176 women taking monophasic pills discontinued early. In the group of participants enrolled for a trial period of 13 cycles, 204 women using triphasic pills and 126 women using monophasic pills discontinued early. The reasons for discontinuation are partially described. The paper reports that 6.5% of the women in the triphasic group and 5.8% of the women in the monophasic group were lost to follow up but provides no numerator. The number of women withdrawn because of protocol violations is not mentioned. The paper states that the evaluation of contraceptive efficacy was based on an intent-to-treat analysis. The evaluation of cycle control was not according to the intention-to-treat principle. Cycles in which data on dosing and bleeding was lacking and cycles with incorrect pill-intake were excluded from the analysis.
