<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 12:21:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Are oral antibiotics effective and safe for treating pain in irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the nerve inside the tooth/nerve damage)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Irreversible pulpitis occurs where the dental pulp (tissue inside the tooth which contains the nerve) has been damaged beyond repair. It is characterised by intense pain (toothache), sufficient to wake someone up at night and is considered to be one of the most frequent reasons that patients attend for emergency dental care. Any tooth may be affected, it is not restricted to particular age groups, and it usually occurs as a direct result of dental decay, a cracked tooth or trauma and thus tends to occur more frequently in older patients.</P>
<P>The 'standard of care' for irreversible pulpitis - immediate removal of the pulp from the affected tooth - is now widely accepted and yet in certain parts of the world antibiotics continue to be prescribed.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 27 January 2016. One study involving 40 people with irreversible pulpitis (nerve damage) was included. There were two groups of 20 people, one group was treated with penicillin 500 mg, the other with placebo (no active ingredient) every six hours over a seven-day period. In addition, all of the participants received painkillers (ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) combined with codeine).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Antibiotics do not appear to significantly reduce toothache caused by irreversible pulpitis. Furthermore, there was no difference in the total number of ibuprofen or Tylenol tablets used over the study period between both groups. The administration of penicillin does not significantly reduce the pain perception, the percussion (tapping on the tooth) perception or the quantity of pain medication required by people with irreversible pulpitis. There was no reporting on adverse events or reactions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as low. There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to decide if antibiotics help for this condition. This review highlights the need for more and better quality studies on the use of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-16 12:45:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Irreversible pulpitis, which is characterised by acute and intense pain, is one of the most frequent reasons that patients attend for emergency dental care. Apart from removal of the tooth, the customary way of relieving the pain of irreversible pulpitis is by drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve) and cleaning the root canal. However, a significant number of dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics to stop the pain of irreversible pulpitis.This review updates the previous version published in 2013.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-18 10:23:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One trial assessed at low risk of bias, involving 40 participants was included in this update of the review. The quality of the body of evidence was rated low for the different outcomes. There was a close parallel distribution of the pain ratings in both the intervention and placebo groups over the seven-day study period. There was insufficient evidence to claim or refute a benefit for penicillin for pain intensity. There was no significant difference in the mean total number of ibuprofen tablets over the study period: 9.2 (standard deviation (SD) 6.02) in the penicillin group versus 9.6 (SD 6.34) in the placebo group; mean difference -0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.23 to 3.43; P value = 0.84). This applied equally for the mean total number of Tylenol tablets: 6.9 (SD 6.87) used in the penicillin group versus 4.45 (SD 4.82) in the placebo group; mean difference 2.45 (95% CI -1.23 to 6.13; P value = 0.19). Our secondary outcome on reporting of adverse events was not addressed in this study.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-16 12:19:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>This systematic review which was based on one low powered small sample trial assessed as at low risk of bias, illustrates that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotics reduce pain or not compared to not having antibiotics. The results of this review confirm the necessity for further larger sample and methodologically sound trials that can provide additional evidence as to whether antibiotics, prescribed in the preoperative phase, can affect treatment outcomes for irreversible pulpitis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 14:59:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-16 12:49:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Dental emergencies are extremely common, a survey conducted in the USA recorded that 12% of the population had experienced toothache in the preceding six months (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1993</LINK>). Non-traumatic dental condition visits account for 1.4% of all emergency dental visits in the USA and have shown an annual rise of 4% (from 1.0% in 1997 to 1.7% in 2007) (<LINK REF="REF-Onkunseri-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onkunseri 2012</LINK>). Dental caries (tooth decay) is the result of bacterial attack on a tooth and is the precursor to irreversible pulpitis, which is considered to be an immune system mediated event affecting the dental pulp (nerve) (<LINK REF="REF-Bergenholtz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergenholtz 1990</LINK>). Acute and intense pain are the most typical presenting symptoms of irreversible pulpitis. It occurs more commonly in vital teeth beneath deep caries before the bacteria have even reached the pulp (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1991</LINK>). Thus the involved tooth will usually have an extensive restoration (filling) or caries or both under which death of the pulp may occur quite quickly or which may take years to occur even if the dental caries is removed (<LINK REF="REF-Tronstad-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tronstad 1991</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-08 03:59:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The symptoms are a continuum and can vary but usually include a history of spontaneous pain which may also involve an exaggerated response to hot or cold that lingers after the stimulus is removed (<LINK REF="REF-Soames-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soames 1998</LINK>). Any tooth may be affected by irreversible pulpitis, it is not restricted to particular age groups, it usually occurs as a direct result of dental caries, a cracked tooth or trauma and thus tends to occur more frequently in older patients. The involved tooth is usually not sensitive to percussion, and palpation tests do not produce an untoward reaction. The characteristics of irreversible pulpitis are a vital pulp which responds to cold and electric pulp testing. Not infrequently, cold may actually alleviate the pain of irreversible pulpitis and thus, can be used as a diagnostic test (<LINK REF="REF-Cecic-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cecic 1983</LINK>). A number of variations of irreversible pulpitis have been recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>). These include acute, subacute, chronic, partial or total, infected or sterile, however it is not possible to clearly differentiate these except by histopathological methods.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-17 16:06:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A range of oral antibiotics with differing dosing regimens may be prescribed e.g. azithromycin (500 mg daily for three days); clindamycin (150 mg four times a day for seven days); penicillin V (250 mg four times a day for seven days); metronidazole (200 mg three times a day for three days); amoxicillin (250 mg + clavulanic acid 125 mg three times a day for five days) (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-17 16:09:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulpitis is an inflammatory reaction of the pulp and often occurs without any evidence of bacteria in the pulp chamber. Antibiotics have bactericidal or bacteriostatic properties or both and are used widely to control or eliminate bacteria, but the mode of action and extent to which antibiotics have an anti-inflammatory or analgesic effect in irreversible pulpitis remains less clear.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-16 12:49:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>There is limited and what appears to be largely anecdotal evidence to support the routine prescribing of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis. It is likely that the practice of prescribing of antibiotics may have arisen due to a misconception of the pathological process of pulpitis or the perception that antibiotics should be prescribed prophylactically in anticipation of pain arising prior to endodontic treatment. Either of these approaches may have promoted the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for endodontic emergencies. A study conducted in the USA of members of the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) surveyed their prescribing practices and reported that 16.7% of the specialist endodontists prescribed antibiotics for cases of irreversible pulpitis (<LINK REF="REF-Yingling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yingling 2002</LINK>). General dental practitioners are often the first point of contact for patients with irreversible pulpitis and although one study conducted in Belgium reported that a smaller proportion (4.3%) of general dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis (<LINK REF="REF-Mainjot-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainjot 2009</LINK>), another study conducted in Spain indicated that a substantial number (86%) of respondents continue to do so (<LINK REF="REF-Segura_x002d_Egea-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura-Egea 2010</LINK>). To further investigate the prescribing behaviours of the general dentists and endodontists, we conducted a survey with the same question as of this review and found that one in every four dentists would prescribe antibiotics, when not needed (<LINK REF="REF-Agnihotry-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agnihotry 2014a</LINK>). In a more recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Cope-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cope 2015</LINK>), it was found out that more than half of the sample size of general dentists (65.6%) prescribed antibiotics when there was no evidence of spreading infection. </P>
<P>It is believed that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics may have added significantly to the increase in the infections caused by multi-drug resistance bacteria. Methicillin resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus </I>(MRSA) infections with concomitant staggering cost implications is one of them (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1995</LINK>). Another emerging multi-drug resistant strain, which is resistant to carbapenem, is Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1). It is spreading over many nations, including India, United Kingdom and United States and has been identified as a possible public health issue which can be dealt only through coordinated international surveillance of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Kumarasamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumarasamy 2010</LINK>). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 100 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed by office-based physicians each year, and that approximately one half of those prescriptions appear to be unnecessary (<LINK REF="REF-Colgan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colgan 2001</LINK>). Although the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for endodontic emergencies has received much attention (<LINK REF="REF-Agnihotry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agnihotry 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2003</LINK>) it is unclear to what extent this may have contributed to the development of resistant strains of bacteria and the growing problem of antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SMAC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">SMAC 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Irreversible pulpitis, at least in the early phase, is not normally accompanied by the clinical signs of bacterial infection, i.e. swelling and tenderness of adjacent mucosa, which more generally manifests itself after the pulp has become necrotic and the infected pulpal tissues pass into the periapical region. Although some dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics, there appears to be very limited evidence that penicillin reduces pain, percussion sensitivity, or the amount of analgesics required in untreated teeth diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Immediate pulpectomy is now widely accepted as the 'standard of care' for irreversible pulpitis (<LINK REF="REF-Walton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2009</LINK>) and yet in certain parts of the world antibiotics continue to be prescribed. We consider that a systematic review is still necessary to provide further evidence of the effects of antibiotics and ultimately more clarity and guidance in the management of this clinical condition.This review updates the previous version published in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Fedorowicz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedorowicz 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The trialists in <LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2000</LINK> used sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) and sum of pain percussion intensity difference (SPPID) to assess between-group differences. Values were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges and were analysed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Each patient was asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no pain; 1 = mild pain, pain that was recognizable but not discomforting; 2 = moderate pain, pain that was discomforting but bearable; 3 = severe pain, pain that caused considerable discomfort and was difficult to bear). Patients were asked to rate the pain to percussion using the same scale. SPID is defined as the sum of pain intensity differences weighted by the length of the interval since the previous observation. These assessments were made at wake-up time over the seven-day study period. We were unsuccessful in our attempts to contact the investigators to provide us with means or ranges of the minimum and maximum scores for SPID and SPPID, and therefore we were unable to calculate and present means, standard deviations and confidence intervals for these outcomes. These have been discussed narratively based on the data as reported in the study (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have presented the continuous outcomes on the original scale as reported in the study for our secondary outcome 'number of painkillers' together with their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). These data were analysed in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) using a random-effects model.</P>
<P>For future studies we will present continuous outcomes on the original scale as reported in each individual study. If similar outcomes were reported using different scales, we would convert these to standardised mean differences (SMD).</P>
<P>We will present dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR), and if found significant, we would convert them to the number needed to treat (NNT) to find one success. We will report all outcomes' data with their associated 95% CIs and analyse the data using a random-effects model in RevMan, with a general inverse variance (DerSimonian and Laird method), unless stated otherwise. In cases where only medians are presented with ranges, the mean is estimated by the median, and the variance using the range and the number of observations (<LINK REF="REF-Hozo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hozo 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methods</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2000</LINK> is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in the emergency department of a university dental college in the USA.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants and setting</HEADING>
<P>Forty adult patients, 17 male, 23 female, with an age range of 30 to 34 years who had presented as an emergency with spontaneous moderate to severe pain associated with a tooth, participated in this study. All of the teeth were vital and responsive to an electric pulp tester (EPT) and to Endo Ice and displayed percussion sensitivity. The diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis was confirmed by a radiographically widened periodontal ligament space (<I>see</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Twenty participants were allocated to antibiotic and analgesic and 20 to placebo and analgesic. The participants received a seven-day oral dose (28 capsules each to be taken every six hours) of either penicillin (500 mg) or a placebo control in which the participants and trialists were double-blinded. They also received a supply of pain medication consisting of ibuprofen 600 mg; paracetamol (acetaminophen) with codeine 30 mg (Tylenol). No operative endodontic treatment was performed during the course of the study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome for this review was pain relief in the preoperative phase of irreversible pulpitis. Participants in this study were requested to complete a seven-day diary in which they recorded pain, percussion pain, and the quantity and type of pain medication taken. Pain was assessed using a short ordinal numerical scale graded from 0 to 3 (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect</LINK>). Additionally, the patients were asked to use the same scale to rate pain on percussion which was achieved by tapping the affected tooth with a finger. The pain scale used in this trial had been used in previous pain studies which were referenced by the trialists of the included study.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome was the type and dose of pain medication required to achieve pain relief. The participants in this study were instructed to initially take one tablet of the ibuprofen every four to six hours as needed for pain and to take the Tylenol (two tablets every four to six hours) only if the ibuprofen did not relieve their pain. Each participant received a seven-day diary to record their symptoms and the number and type of pain medication taken. No assessments of adverse effects to either the antibiotics or analgesics were considered or reported by the investigators.</P>

<P>Baseline data indicated that all of the participants that entered the study had moderate to severe pain (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). After the first day of the study the average pain rating decreased and remained quite stable over the following six days. This initial decrease in pain may be considered to be due to the effect of the analgesics which was sustained by the gradual and progressive necrosis of the pulp. However, at the end of the study period and at the commencement of operative endodontic treatment it was found that 75% of the teeth in the penicillin group and 80% in the placebo were still vital.<BR/>There was a close parallel distribution of the pain ratings in both the intervention and placebo groups over the seven days. The following data were presented as medians with their interquartile range. The in between-group differences in sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) for the penicillin group were (6.0 ± 10.5), and for placebo (6.0 ± 9.5) P value = 0.776. The sum of pain percussion intensity difference (SPPID) for the penicillin group was (3.5 ±7.5) and placebo (2.0 ± 7.0) P value = 0.290 with differences as assessed by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test considered by the investigators of the study to be statistically significant at P value &lt; 0.05 (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

The number not taking any medication increased to three to four (15% to 20% ) on day three, and two to six (10% to 30%) on day four. On the fifth to seventh days only four to seven (20% to 35%) did not take any additional pain medication. At day seven, 20% of the penicillin group and 35% of the placebo group took no additional analgesics.<BR/>There was no significant difference in the mean total number of ibuprofen tablets over the study period: 9.2 (standard deviation (SD) 6.02) in the penicillin group versus 9.6 (SD 6.34) in the placebo group; mean difference -0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.23 to 3.43; P value = 0.84). The same was true for the mean total number of Tylenol tablets: 6.9 (SD 6.87) in the penicillin group versus 4.45 (SD 4.82) in the placebo group; mean difference 2.45 (95% CI -1.23 to 6.13; P value = 0.19).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-18 10:24:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>The results of this well constructed but underpowered trial of 20 participants in each study arm indicate that the administration of penicillin did not appear to significantly (P value &gt; 0.05) reduce either the pain perception, the percussion perception or the quantity of analgesic medication required by patients with irreversible pulpitis. Our secondary outcome regarding adverse events or reactions was not addressed. The quality of the evidence was rated low for the different outcomes. For further details <I>see</I> <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.<BR/>The significance of the relatively common occurrence of toothache, the prevalence of inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics with the potential for producing antibiotic resistance and patient sensitisation cannot be underestimated.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-08 04:40:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The single included study (<LINK REF="STD-Nagle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagle 2000</LINK>) provides insufficient evidence that the administration of antibiotics is effective in relieving the pain from irreversible pulpitis. However, although we consider that the population, intervention, comparator to the intervention, and outcome of interest satisfy the clinical question of our review, the lack of further research since this study was conducted, which is still highly desirable, would appear to indicate that there is a wider acceptance that the 'standard of care' and appropriate management strategy for irreversible pulpitis is immediate extirpation of the pulp.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence as summarised in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> was rated as low. The most important reasons for downgrading for each outcome were: imprecision, mainly due to low sample size and the 95% confidence interval included no effect and the upper or lower confidence limit crossed the minimal important difference.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations in study design and implementation</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any limitations in either the design or implementation of the study (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). However, adverse events were not addressed in this study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indirectness of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Although limited to a single study, the evidence can be directly generalized to the clinical scenario of the presentation of irreversible pulpitis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inconsistency of the results</HEADING>
<P>The single included study did not allow any assessment of inconsistency of results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Imprecision of the results</HEADING>
<P>The single study with a low sample size included in this review provided limited amounts of data. Our primary outcome was downgraded due to small sample size, and due to the sparse data we were unable to further evaluate the imprecision of the results. However, for our secondary outcome we downgraded twice as the confidence intervals included no effect and both the upper and lower confidence limit crossed the minimal important difference.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Although it would be reasonable to assume that the comprehensive searches will have identified all existing randomised controlled trials, and thereby helped to limit bias in the conduct of this review, the absence of any published trials over the last 10 years creates a measure of uncertainty that there may be further and as yet unpublished studies which might add to the overall evidence.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-06 06:03:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>We made every attempt to limit bias in the review process by ensuring a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies. The authors' independent assessments of eligibility of studies for inclusion in this review minimised the potential for selection bias. The effects of language bias on the identification and selection of studies for inclusion in a systematic review is widely recognised; therefore, we ensured that language of publication was not used as an exclusion criterion.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-16 14:07:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Our electronic searches did identify two systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Aminoshariae-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aminoshariae 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthews-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 2003</LINK>) which offered strong confirmatory evidence that in the absence of systemic complications e.g. fever, lymphadenopathy, cellulitis or in immunocompromised patients, antibiotics alone have no place in the management of localised acute apical abscess. Furthermore, they stated that although the pain from acute apical abscess is as a result of an infective process, the infection is localised and that even in this terminal stage of irreversible pulpitis the use of antibiotics as a sole or concomitant therapy remains questionable.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In our search for additional studies and reviews, we also examined several clinical references and sources for guidelines and systematic reviews: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (<A HREF="http://www.ahrq.gov/">http://www.ahrq.gov/</A>), National Guidelines Clearinghouse (<A HREF="http://www.guideline.gov/">http://www.guideline.gov/</A>), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<A HREF="http://www.nice.org.uk/">http://www.nice.org.uk/</A>), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<A HREF="http://www.sign.ac.uk/index.html">http://www.sign.ac.uk/index.html</A>), UK Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments (<A HREF="http://www.library.nhs.uk/duets/">http://www.library.nhs.uk/duets/</A>) and UpTo Date (<A HREF="http://www.uptodate.com/home">http://www.uptodate.com/home</A>). It was surprising to find that the majority did not address this clinical topic or provided very limited useful or current information that could aid clinical decision-making.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-16 14:08:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>This review illustrates that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotics reduce pain or not when compared to not having antibiotics. The quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was low, mainly due to imprecision of the data. Although there was a paucity of high quality evidence to guide clinical practice, the prescribing of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis should not be seen as a substitute for immediate pulpectomy which is now widely accepted as the 'standard of care'.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-18 11:18:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The results of this systematic review confirm the necessity for further larger sample and methodologically sound trials that can help provide additional evidence as to whether antibiotics can affect treatment outcomes for irreversible pulpitis.<BR/>Any future randomised controlled trials must be well-designed, well-conducted, and adequately delivered with subsequent reporting, including high-quality descriptions of all aspects of methodology. Reporting should conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>) which will enable appraisal and interpretation of results, and accurate judgements to be made about the risk of bias, and the overall quality of the evidence.<BR/>Although it is uncertain whether reported quality mirrors actual study conduct, it is noteworthy that studies with unclear methodology have been shown to produce biased estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>For further research recommendations based on the EPICOT (evidence, population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and time) format (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>), <I>see</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. However, it may be more appropriate for future research to concentrate on pain control rather than prescription of antibiotics.</P>
