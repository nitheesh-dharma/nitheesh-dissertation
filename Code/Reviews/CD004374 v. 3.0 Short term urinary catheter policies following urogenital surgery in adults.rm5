<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:13:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary catheters are often used after urological or gynaecological surgery to check on urine output, to allow patients to pass urine, to allow washing out of the bladder and to help tissues heal. They can be inserted via the urethra (tube between the bladder and the outside) or suprapubically (through the abdomen). Different designs or materials may be used for the catheters, and different ways of managing the catheters and their removal are available. This review assesses the evidence for these options.<BR/>
<BR/>Five trials suggested that it might be better to use a catheter after surgery than not to use one as fewer people needed to be re-catheterised if a catheter was used at first. Information from six trials suggested that fewer people needed to be re-catheterised for urinary retention if a suprapubic catheter was used instead of a urethral one. People in up to 11 trials had fewer urinary tract infections if the catheters were removed sooner rather than later.<BR/>
<BR/>Although 39 trials were included in the review in total, the evidence in general was poor and came from small studies, which often did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions. Much larger trials with many more participants must be conducted.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Urinary catheterisation (by the urethral or suprapubic routes) is common following urogenital surgery. There is no consensus on how to minimize complications and practice varies.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To establish the optimal way to manage urinary catheters following urogenital surgery in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group specialised trials register (searched 30 May 2005) and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials were identified. Studies were excluded if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised trials of adults being catheterised following urogenital surgery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data collection was performed independently by two of the review authors and cross-checked. Where data might have been collected but not reported, clarification was sought from the trialists. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty nine randomised trials were identified for inclusion in the review. They were generally small and of poor or moderate quality reporting data on only few outcomes. Confidence intervals were all wide.</P>
<P>
<B>Using a urinary catheter versus not using one</B>
<BR/>The data from five trials were heterogeneous but tended to indicate a higher risk of (re)catheterisation if a catheter was not used postoperatively. The data gave only an imprecise estimate of any difference in urinary tract infection. </P>
<P>
<B>Urethral catheterisation versus suprapubic catheterisation</B>
<BR/>In six trials, a greater number of people needed to be recatheterised if a urethral catheter rather than a suprapubic one was used following surgery (RR 3.66, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.49). </P>
<P>
<B>Shorter postoperative duration of catheter use versus longer duration</B>
<BR/>In 11 trials, the seven trials with data suggested fewer urinary tract infections when a catheter was removed earlier (for example 1 versus 3 days, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87) with no pattern in respect of catheterisation.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Clamp and release policies before catheter removal versus immediate catheter removal</B>
<BR/>In a single small trial, the clamp-and-release group showed a significantly greater incidence of urinary tract infections (RR 4.00, 95% 1.55 to 10.29) and a delay in return to normal voiding (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.39). <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite reviewing 39 eligible trials, few firm conclusions could be reached because of the multiple comparisons considered, the small size of individual trials, and their low quality. Whether or not to use a particular policy is usually a trade-off between the risks of morbidity (especially infection) and risks of recatheterisation.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:53:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The urinary catheter is a drainage tube introduced into the urinary bladder to allow bladder emptying and collection of urine. Its use can be traced back to prehistoric times, and it has a wide range of applications within medicine. This review focuses on the use of urinary catheters following urogenital surgery in adults.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Urinary catheter use following urogenital surgery</HEADING>
<P>In general, a urinary catheter is used postoperatively for the monitoring of urine output, or if the patient is immobile. Urinary catheters are frequently used after urogenital surgery for a number of additional reasons related to the direct effects of surgery: to allow irrigation of the bladder and prostatic bed following endoscopic bladder or prostatic resection; to allow bladder emptying when natural voiding may be impossible due to the effects of the surgery, such as pain or soft tissue swelling; or to ensure that the bladder remains empty during a period of tissue or anastomotic healing such as following bladder augmentation or radical prostatectomy.</P>
<P>The four broad categories of urogenital surgery to be considered in this review are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>open or laparoscopic abdominal urological surgery (e.g. bladder reconstruction or augmentation, radical prostatectomy);</LI>
<LI>open or laparoscopic urogynaecological procedures (e.g. bladder neck suspension procedures, such as colposuspension or tension-free vaginal tape, hysterectomy, prolapse repair);</LI>
<LI>endoscopic urological surgery (e.g. optical urethrotomy, prostatic and bladder resection, transurethral bulking agent injection, endourological procedures to the ureter and renal pelvis);</LI>
<LI>penile and scrotal surgery.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Routes of urinary catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>The urinary catheter can be introduced into the urinary bladder by two routes, urethral or suprapubic. The urethral route is more commonly employed, and is generally performed with lubricant gel (water based or local anaesthetic-containing lubricating gel). Suprapubic catheterisation is the passage of a urinary catheter into the bladder through the suprapubic region of the anterior abdominal wall. It requires local, regional, or general anaesthesia. It can be achieved percutaneously, or by open cystotomy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Catheter materials</HEADING>
<P>The composition of urinary catheters varies. Silicone catheters are thought to cause the least tissue irritation (<LINK REF="REF-Nacey-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nacey 1985</LINK>), and are therefore suitable for long-term use. There is evidence suggesting that silver alloy catheters reduce the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) (<LINK REF="REF-Davenport-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenport 2005</LINK>). Latex catheters are cheaper, but are thought to cause more urethral irritation, and are therefore indicated for short-term use only. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) catheters are stronger and are often the composition of 3-way catheters used for bladder irrigation and wash-out. The choice depends on clinical indication, cost, availability, and personal preference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of urinary catheter used</HEADING>
<P>The majority of urinary catheters (urethral or suprapubic) are of the Foley type, held in position by inflation of a water-filled balloon. The balloon is inflated via a channel running along the length of the catheter, and the pressure is maintained by a valve at its external (distal) end.</P>
<P>Urinary catheters used in urogenital surgery commonly have one or two further channels: they are known as 2- or 3-way catheters respectively. One of the channels allows drainage of the bladder externally, and the further channel of the 3-way catheter allows irrigation of fluid into the bladder. The 3-way catheter thus enables simultaneous irrigation and drainage of the bladder, used for example following endoscopic bladder or prostatic resection (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>A range of sizes of urinary catheter are available, and are again employed according to clinical circumstance. For example, the 3-way catheter used following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is usually size 20 French gauge or larger with a 30 ml balloon which serves as a tamponade to the prostatic fossa.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications of urinary catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>Urinary catheters have a number of potential complications. Urethral catheter insertion may be difficult, for example due to abnormal anatomy such as hypospadias or urethral stricture, or require an introducer for example following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Insertion of the catheter can therefore be traumatic, causing urethral injury and subsequent urethral stricture (<LINK REF="REF-Blacklock-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blacklock 1986</LINK>), or bladder perforation. Suprapubic catheter insertion can be complicated by visceral injury (<LINK REF="REF-Parikh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 1992</LINK>) or bleeding.</P>
<P>Following urogenital surgery the in-situ catheter can lead to urethral pain, detrusor overactivity or urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Bonadio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonadio 2001</LINK>). Systemic or local infection can also complicate catheter insertion or removal. Difficulty or failure to void, or haematuria may follow removal of catheters.</P>
<P>There is no consensus as to which catheter is the best in which circumstances and this is reflected in the wide variety of types and methods of urinary catheterisation following urogenital surgery. Provided that a sufficient number of trials of adequate quality have been conducted, the most reliable evidence for making a choice is likely to come from consideration of all well-designed randomised controlled trials. Our aim was to provide an easily accessible, periodically updated, comprehensive systematic review of such trials which will not only help to identify optimal practice, but also highlight gaps in the evidence base.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The purpose of this review was to establish the optimal use of urinary catheters following urogenital surgery, according to evidence from randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>For the range of urogenital surgery, the following comparisons were addressed:</P>
<P>1. using a urinary catheter versus not using one; </P>
<P>2. urethral catheterisation versus suprapubic catheterisation;</P>
<P>3. one type of catheter (e.g. silastic, latex, silicone) versus another one;</P>
<P>4. one type of catheter management versus another one;<BR/> <BR/>5. a larger-diameter catheter versus a smaller-diameter one; </P>
<P>6. using irrigation or washout of the bladder versus none or different types of irrigation or washout;</P>
<P>7. short post-operative duration of catheter use versus long duration;</P>
<P>8. clamp-and-release policies before catheter removal versus immediate removal;</P>
<P>9. catheter removal at one time of day versus removal at another (e.g. early morning versus at night);</P>
<P>10. use of trial of void protocol versus none;</P>
<P>11. pre-filling of the bladder with fluid prior to catheter removal versus removal without pre-filling.</P>

<P>All possibly eligible studies were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion by two of the review authors without prior consideration of the results. Assessment of methodological quality was undertaken by each review author using the Incontinence Group's assessment criteria which include quality of random allocation and concealment, description of dropouts and withdrawals, analysis by intention to treat, and 'blinding' at outcome assessment. Any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion with a third party.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviewers of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). When appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken. For categorical outcomes we related the numbers reporting an outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a relative risk (RR). For continuous variables, we used means and standard deviations to derive a weighted mean difference (WMD). A fixed effect model was used for calculations of pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Differences between trials was further investigated if significant heterogeneity was found from the Chi square or I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) or appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results. If there was no obvious reason for the heterogeneity, a random effects model was used. If a reason was found, consideration was given to whether or not it was appropriate to combine data.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis related to individual methodological criteria was to be carried out if the data allowed (e.g. quality of concealment of allocation). Sub-group analyses would have been undertaken if the data were sufficient (e.g. male/female, different diagnostic groups, prior history of lower urinary tract symptoms, effect of regional or general anaesthesia).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of Randomisation / Concealment of Allocation</HEADING>
<P>Only seven of the included studies described a method of allocation that might provide adequate allocation concealment after randomisation.

The finding from one study showing a shorter hospital stay in the group managed with a suprapubic catheter (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.90, Comparison 02.11) (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1987</LINK>) should be interpreted cautiously as this was the trial that showed a large number of urinary tract infections in the urethral group. There were only very few data about post-operative UTI (Comparison 02.05), post-operative haematuria (Comparison 02.10), the frequency of catheters blocking or bypassing (Comparison 02.14) and voiding patterns (Comparison 02.15 and Other Data Table 2.16).</P>

One examined the effect of adding an extra drainage hole to a standard Foley catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Rubino-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rubino 1983</LINK>), but applied no statistical analysis to the results. Another study, in two parts, compared the use of silver alloy catheters with silicone and latex catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Verleyen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Verleyen 1999</LINK>).

One study examined the effect of the sequence of vaginal cleansing and urethral catheterisation before surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2000</LINK>), but was too small to demonstrate or rule out differences between groups in the development of post-operative retention of urine, dysuria, abnormal frequency or urgency of voiding or UTI. Two trials tested antibiotic prophylaxis. One showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of UTI in the group who received cefotaxime prior to catheter removal following TURP compared to those who did not, but with wide confidence intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Duclos-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Duclos 1992</LINK>). In the third trial, instillation via the urethral catheter with Neomycin and Sulphamethiazole was associated with a significantly lower frequency of post operative UTI compared to placebo (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.55, Comparison 04.05.10), and a non-statistically significant lower frequency of need to recatheterise (Comparison 04.08) (<LINK REF="STD-Waissmann-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Waissmann 1983</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Urinary catheterisation is common following urogenital surgery. This carries the risk of significant morbidity, and any evidence for identifying optimal practice in respect of catheter use in these circumstance would be welcome to the clinician. The objective of this review was to systematically review such evidence from randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>It was disappointing therefore that few firm conclusions could be reached despite identifying a relatively large number of trials. One reason was that the review included as many as 11 objectives and the trials addressed eight of these. Individually, the trials were of poor or moderate methodological quality. Usually, only a minority of the review outcomes were reported, and then sometimes incompletely (for example, no SDs). No trial included more than 300 participants and most sample sizes were around 100 or less. Some comparisons were complicated by heterogeneity. Even when it was possible to combine data, confidence intervals were wide and hence it proved impossible to identify or rule out true differences reliably. Specific limitations were: </P>
<UL>
<LI>failure to describe the method of concealment of randomisation or using a suboptimal method (quasi-randomised methods); </LI>
<LI>failure to report inclusion and exclusion criteria; variability in inclusion and exclusion criteria resulting in clinical heterogeneity between the trials; </LI>
<LI>lack of presentation of baseline data so that comparability can be assessed;</LI>
<LI>use of unvalidated outcome measures or reporting outcomes in ways which precluded combination for meta-analysis; </LI>
<LI>variable quality of blinding or blinding not possible; </LI>
<LI>types of catheters not specified; </LI>
<LI>variations in removal protocols making combination of data difficult; </LI>
<LI>variations in types of operations; </LI>
<LI>failure to describe withdrawals; </LI>
<LI>most trials followed gynaecological surgery rather than urological surgery </LI>
<LI>lack of formal economic evaluations such as cost-effectiveness (although some limited data about bed costs, length of hospital stay or number of catheters used was presented). </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>No comparisons were made between suprapubic catheters and no catheters, different sizes (diameters) of catheters, different bladder washout policies after surgery, or different protocols concerning management of voiding difficulties. </P>
<P>There was conflicting or insufficient evidence about the benefits of using a catheter for a period after operation (such as 24 hours) compared with immediate removal after operation. However, there was some evidence that there may less need for recatheterisation after hysterectomy if there is a short period of continuous drainage but there was significant heterogeneity amongst the trials, perhaps reflecting the different types of surgery involved. </P>
<P>When comparing urethral versus suprapubic catheters, more women required re-catheterisation following surgery in the urethral catheter group based on the two trials with data (Comparison 02.08). The reasons were not stated but were assumed to be related to failure to void or incontinence. Spontaneous voiding was seen more frequently in the suprapubic group although the protocols followed to achieve this are not clear. In one trial, hospital stay was reduced after suprapubic catheterisation (Comparison 02.11). There were limited data about other outcomes. However, there is evidence from another Cochrane review which included participants undergoing other types of operations, that suprapubic catheters were better than indwelling urethral catheters in terms of bacteriuria, need for recatheterisation and discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Niel_x002d_Weise-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niel-Weise 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Regarding types of catheters, two types of Foley catheters (one with and one without an additional drainage hole), a silver alloy catheter and silastic or latex catheters were compared. Again the data were few. However another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Brosnahan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosnahan 2004</LINK>) including a wider range of trials also suggested that silver coating may reduce bacteriuria, but larger trials are needed to address this question reliably.</P>
<P>There was not enough evidence to compare different methods of managing catheters, such as cleansing or use of prophylactic antibiotics or instillation of antibiotics into the catheter.<BR/>
<BR/>Although 11 trials addressed the issue of the duration of catheterisation after surgery, there was not enough evidence to show that any policy was better than another, although the data available did suggest fewer UTI's when the catheter is removed early and some did infer that savings could be made. </P>
<P>Only a single small trial compared clamp and release policies prior to catheter removal with immediate removal. Urinary tract infections were more common in the clamp and release group and this group took longer to return to normal bladder function, but the confidence intervals around these were wide.</P>
<P>Whether the catheter was removed in the morning or the night before did not seem to result in consistent differences in clinically important outcomes, although all the trials were small. In a Cochrane Review including trials other than after urogenital surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2005</LINK>) there appeared to be some advantages to removal at midnight, such as shorter length of hospitalisation. </P>
<P>Prefilling of the bladder before catheter removal has been advocated as a way of retraining the bladder to sense fullness. However, the two small trials which addressed this comparison did not provide sufficient evidence to address this.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The objective of the review was to help identify optimal practice of catheter use following urogenital surgery. Due to the poor quality or small size of many of the trials, few conclusions can be reliably drawn. There was some weak evidence that there may be less need for recatheterisation if there is a short period of continuous drainage. For a range of gynaecological surgery, post-operative use of a suprapubic catheter reduced the incidence of recatheterisation, compared to use of a urethral catheter. Shorter duration of catheter use was associated with fewer urinary tract infections. One small trial suggested that there might be less bacteriuria if silver-coated catheters are used, but the effect on the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection or other morbidity was unknown, and this is consistent with another Cochrane review. The value of antibiotic instillation before catheter removal and of clamp-and release before catheter removal could not be assessed reliably. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for good quality trials to address the variety of important strategies related to short-term catheter use in urogenital surgery because of the short comings of the trials conducted to data.</P>
<P>In particular, there are no randomised trials addressing the issues of catheter size, bladder irrigation or trial of voiding protocols following urogenital surgery. There is also a need for those conclusions than can be drawn from this review to be further qualified by more adequate cost-effectiveness analyses and participant-assessed outcome measurements. </P>
<P>None of the 11 objectives could be addressed reliably. New trials must address the limitations of the trials reviewed here: they must be substantially larger (thousands rather than hundred of participants), use secure methods of randomisation and take steps to ensure unbiased assessment of outcome.</P>
