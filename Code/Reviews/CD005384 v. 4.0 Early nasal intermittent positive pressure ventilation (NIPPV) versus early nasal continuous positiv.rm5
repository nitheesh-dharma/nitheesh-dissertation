<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-09 11:35:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question: Does NIPPV confer greater short-term and long-term benefits without harm to preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress compared with NCPAP?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Some evidence suggests that nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) increases the effectiveness of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm babies who have respiratory difficulties or are at risk of such difficulties. Preterm babies with breathing problems often require help from a machine (ventilator) that provides regular breaths through a tube in the windpipe. Pediatricians caring for these preterm infants try to avoid use of ventilators, as they can damage the growing lung. NCPAP and NIPPV are ways of supporting babies' breathing in a less invasive way - the tubes are shorter and go only to the back of the nose, thereby causing less damage to the lungs. NCPAP and NIPPV may be used early after birth to reduce the number of babies needing to go on a ventilator. NCPAP provides steady pressure to the back of the nose that is transmitted to the lungs, helping the baby breathe more comfortably. NIPPV provides the same support but also adds some breaths through the ventilator.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>We searched scientific databases for studies comparing NCPAP with NIPPV in preterm infants (born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) who need respiratory support shortly after birth. We looked at breathing problems, the need for a breathing tube and ventilator, and side effects. The evidence is current to September 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>We found nine trials comparing NCPAP with NIPPV. When analyzing all trials, we found that NIPPV reduces the risk for respiratory failure and the need for a ventilator. Additional studies are needed to determine how NIPPV can be best delivered to infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>The overall quality of the studies included in this review was good.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-03 11:17:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a strategy for maintaining positive airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle through the application of bias flow of respiratory gas to an apparatus attached to the nose. Treatment with NCPAP is associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation and might be effective in reducing chronic lung disease. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a form of noninvasive ventilation during which patients are exposed intermittently to higher levels of airway pressure, along with NCPAP through the same nasal device.</P>

<P>Primary endpoints are respiratory failure and the need for intubated ventilatory support during the first week of life.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-03 20:25:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to September 28, 2015), Embase (1980 to September 28, 2015), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to September 28, 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. A member of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group handsearched abstracts from the European Society of Pediatric Research (ESPR). We contacted the authors of ongoing clinical trials to ask for information.</P>

The meta-analysis did not demonstrate a reduction in the risk of CLD among infants randomized to NIPPV (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06). Investigators observed no evidence of harm.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-03 20:31:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-03 12:05:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD), also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is the most common serious morbidity among preterm infants. BPD has been defined historically as the need for supplemental oxygen therapy at 28 days of life; however, over time, this definition evolved to describe the need for supplemental oxygen therapy at 36 weeks' postgestational age, and it has been further standardized to include the need for oxygen therapy at 36 weeks' postgestational age to achieve oxygen saturation of 88% for 60 minutes or longer (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The major risk factor for chronic lung disease is prematurity necessitating treatment with oxygen and mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Marter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Marter 2000</LINK>), both of which are potentially modifiable. The pathogenesis of CLD involves barotrauma or volutrauma (due to assisted ventilation) that results in airway injury, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and parenchymal lung fibrosis and emphysematous changes, often complicated by inflammation, genetic predisposition, and concomitant abnormalities such as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). CLD is also associated with increased risk of many cardiovascular abnormalities such as progressive pulmonary hypertension (due to hypoxia and vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vasculature), systemic hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy. It is important to note that whereas the survival of extremely low birth weight infants has increased over the years, rates of CLD have stayed relatively constant despite improving technology. CLD remains a serious problem; the incidence of CLD may be on the rise because of increased survival among the most vulnerable infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoelhorst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoelhorst 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neonatologists have looked for noninvasive ways to support the breathing of preterm infants to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-03 20:29:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous distending airway pressure with the application of nasal constant positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has been used as a strategy for avoiding endotracheal tube ventilation, thereby minimizing the risk of CLD.</P>
<P>Historical analyses of nasal ventilation demonstrate a decreased incidence of BPD and reduced need for intubation in infants treated with noninvasive respiratory support. A study by Avery et al in 1987 demonstrated very different rates of CLD at eight institutions in the United States. The institution with the lowest rate of CLD, Columbia University, was also the institution with the highest use of nasal prong respiratory support in preterm infants with birth weight between 700 and 1500 grams. Infants showing signs of respiratory distress received nasal positive pressure support in the delivery room or within three hours of life. These infants were less likely than infants at other institutions to need mechanical ventilation, and they were less likely to develop BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, although at some centers NCPAP is a successful therapy for preterm infants, this success is not replicated at all centers. "Failures" of NCPAP are common, and many infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation ultimately require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2004</LINK>). In a randomized trial by Finer et al in 2004, infants who received NCPAP in the delivery room were no less likely than infants without NCPAP to need endotracheal intubation in the delivery room or in the subsequent first week of life. This study demonstrated instead a profound effect of gestational age on the need for intubation (virtually all infants born at 23 weeks required intubation vs only 14% of infants born at 27 weeks), regardless of the cohort to which they had been randomized (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a simple, effective mode of respiratory support. NIPPV augments continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with superimposed inflations to a set peak pressure. NIPPV may be delivered by nasal mask or prongs, which may be short or long, single or binasal. Some devices attempt to synchronize inflations with the infant's respiratory efforts.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-03 12:31:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NIPPV reduces asynchronous thoracoabdominal motion, perhaps as a result of reduced tube resistance or better stabilization of the chest wall, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Kiciman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiciman 1998</LINK>). NIPPV results in improved tidal and minute volumes and decreased inspiratory effort required by neonates when compared with NCPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Moretti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moretti 1999</LINK>). NIPPV may decrease the need for intubation and endotracheal tube ventilation and their associated risks. To evaluate the efficacy of NIPPV, these potential benefits should be weighed against the risks associated with delivery of positive pressure to the upper airway, pharynx, and esophagus. Potential risks of NIPPV include nasal septal injury and gastrointestinal perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1985</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-03 20:31:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, two Cochrane reviews are comparing NCPAP versus NIPPV - one for treatment of infants with apnea of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Lemyre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemyre 2002</LINK>), and the other for prevention of extubation failure (<LINK REF="REF-Lemyre-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemyre 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review by Lemyre et al titled "Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) for preterm neonates after extubation" reveals a decreased need for reintubation among infants treated with NIPPV versus NCPAP. The review authors concluded that use of NIPPV may prevent extubation failure more effectively than use of NCPAP.</P>
<P>Thus, previous studies have shown that NIPPV may be superior to NCPAP in other clinical scenarios (eg, prevention of extubation failure, prevention of apnea), and it remains to be shown whether early NIPPV may provide similar benefit in preventing the primary need for intubation and mechanical ventilation when compared with NCPAP. This review seeks to determine whether NIPPV or NCPAP is a better primary mode of nasal ventilation for preventing respiratory failure, the need for intubation, and development of CLD, without causing harm such as air leak or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: respiratory failure, need for endotracheal tube ventilation (IPPV through an endotracheal tube), chronic lung disease (oxygen therapy at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age), pneumothorax, severe IVH (grade III/IV), and mortality (neonatal and before discharge) (post hoc).</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations on the basis of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias. We used the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence.</P>

<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-12-14 14:06:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analysis performed in this review showed a strong effect of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on prevention of respiratory failure or need for intubation the first few days after birth in infants with respiratory distress. Results showed no reduction in risk of chronic lung disease (CLD) overall but revealed a reduction in one trial, in which infants received surfactant before randomization. We identified no other short-term benefit and no harm in any trials. Most included studies were small, single-center trials. Eight of the 10 trials identified in this review had no major methodological limitations. Two trials were quasi-randomized and had potential selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Armanian-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Armanian 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salama-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Salama 2015</LINK>), and one was reported as an abstract with clearly presented data (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2013</LINK>). Because of the nature of the interventions, it has been impossible to blind caregivers, and bias may have arisen through uneven use of co-interventions. Investigators dealt with potential confounders, such as methylxanthine usage and indications for intubation, by having management protocols in place and by using objective respiratory failure criteria, enhancing confidence in study findings.</P>
<P>Because of the promising results of another related systematic review on NIPPV versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) to aid with extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Lemyre-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemyre 2014</LINK>), it is reasonable to conclude that NIPPV might be more effective than NCPAP alone in providing respiratory support to preterm infants and in preventing the need for intubation. Results may have revealed differences in the effectiveness of different devices used to provide NIPPV (ventilator and bilevel); however, additional studies are needed to delineate this. We could not determine benefits for a subgroup of (smaller and more immature) infants included in this review. However, researchers should further assess benefits as well as relatively uncommon risks such as pneumothorax and severe intraventricular hemorrhage because occasionally large trials can disagree with the results of meta-analysis of smaller trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cappelleri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappelleri 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>Early NIPPV does appear to be superior to NCPAP alone for the treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in decreasing respiratory failure and the need for intubation and endotracheal tube ventilation. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and to assess the safety of NIPPV compared with NCPAP alone in a larger patient population.</P>

<P>Future research should assess the efficacy and safety of early NIPPV compared with NCPAP for treatment of preterm infants with RDS, with specific focus on devices used and on synchronization. Clinically relevant outcomes, such as long-term survival and incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment, are important to explore.</P>

<P>Because the technology and the terminology of these interventions have evolved in recent years, we expanded our search terms to include nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation, NIMV, nasal distending pressure, nasal positive pressure, nasal ventilation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, SIMV, nasopharyngeal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, bilevel CPAP, BiCPAP, BiPAP, and SiPAP. We amended the search dates to include articles written between protocol publication and the official search day for the review. Because we found the original requirement of infant enrollment in studies before the age of six hours to be too stringent, we relaxed the criteria to include studies in which nasal ventilation was described as "prophylactic" or "early."</P>
<P>We added methods and plans for "Summary of findings" tables and GRADE recommendations, which were not included in the original protocol.</P>

<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table:<BR/>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (any truly random process, eg, random number table, computer random number generator);<BR/>b. high risk (any nonrandom process, eg, odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (eg, telephone or central randomization, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>b. high risk (open random allocation, eg, unsealed or nonopaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;<BR/>b. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel; or<BR/>c. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);<BR/>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (when it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>b. high risk (when not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (eg, whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>a. low risk;<BR/>b. high risk; or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
