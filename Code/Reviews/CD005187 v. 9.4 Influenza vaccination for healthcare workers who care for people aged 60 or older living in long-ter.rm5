The baseline N of residents reported in the abstract of this study is 2604, whereas the sum of the residents in these outcomes for Hayward is 5151. I had the impression on reading the table of results on page 4 that although the numerators were obviously independent for mortality, the denominators and also numerators for the non-fatal endpoints were not likely to have been so. Therefore entering the sum of the two years&amp;#8217; will likely double count participants, and could conceivably double count them as both numerator (e.g. experienced ILI in both years), denominator (did not experience ILI in either year) or as both (ILI one year and not in the other).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; I am still finding my way around cluster randomised trials, but I think that the data you entered for these studies were raw and did not take account of the clustering. On inspection the studies did make efforts to this end and these are indeed reported in the Characteristics of included studies section of the review. I have put together a workbook detailing how I have calculated the standard errors for the cluster studies. Predictably the amount of information that we ideally need to do this optimally is lacking. I have used the reported design effect in the Le Maitre study (1.9) to derive an adjusted SE for the Le Maitre outcomes, but the equivalent information in Hayward I cannot derive satisfactorily from the trial report (they claim to have based their ICCs on those of Potter and Carman but can find this data in neither trial report). Hayward et al report a &amp;#8216;cluster variance&amp;#8217; of 2.3%, so I have used this as an estimate of the ICC for this study (0.023) and borrowed it for those of Potter and Carman. The Cochrane Handbook contains advice about deriving design effects from ICCs; but if you know of the ICCs for these studies (and have info that I don&amp;#8217;t have access to) this would help to make the pooled estimates more reliable. Thus far I have retained the original unadjusted data (pending your confirmation of the numerator/denominator issue in Hayward) and provide a third comparison with the standard errors inflated: the methods I used for this are outlined in the workbook. In short I logged the original unadjusted estimates and 95% CIs, multiplied the SE by the square root of design effect calculated from the imputed ICC (for Le maitre I used their reported DE of 1.9), and entered both the odds or risk ratio and the SEs as generic inverse variance data. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;05/06/13 Note from Roger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom, Toby and I all think that Hayward 2006 and Oshitani 2000 address the issue of influenza vaccination of health care workers who look after those &amp;gt;= 60, but do not use the outcome measures that we, based on our assessment of the literature, now assess as appropriate to answer the research question. Thus, we have gone to the trouble of reporting all their study details in the Included Studies table so readers can see that we are correct.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-05-31 07:51:45 +1000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley" REVIEW_NO="A108" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.4">

<P>Based on our literature review, we now determine that two outcome measures, (influenza-like illness (ILI) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) and all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>)), reported in the first and second publications of this review, are inappropriate measures of influenza vaccine effectiveness. They are not registered indications for the vaccine. Therefore, the outcome data from <LINK REF="STD-Hayward-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hayward 2006</LINK> (main outcome measure all-cause mortality and secondary outcome measure ILI) and <LINK REF="STD-Oshitani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oshitani 2000</LINK> (outcome measure ILI) are no longer presented.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:53:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We wanted to know if vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza reduces the risk of older individuals in long-term care institutions (LTCIs) acquiring influenza infections from healthcare workers.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>The signs and symptoms of influenza are similar to those of many other respiratory illnesses, therefore it is important in studies testing the effects of influenza vaccination to prove by laboratory tests, which are highly accurate, whether residents in LTCIs actually have influenza or another respiratory illness.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>Our evidence is current to October 2015. Overall five studies were included in our review but we used data from three trials with 5896 residents . In one trial the average age was 77 and 71% were female, in another this was 82 years and 70% were female, and in the last this was 86 years and 77% were female. One study was supported by the Greater Glasgow Health Board Care of the Elderly Unit, one by the Wellcome Trust and for one there was no statement.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The method of randomisation used was at low risk in two trials and unclear in one. In all three studies allocation concealment and blinding were unclear. In two studies data could not be included from everyone who was recruited and this put their results at a high risk of bias. All three studies reported outcomes completely. However, in all three trials there was performance bias due to incomplete influenza vaccination of healthcare workers in the intervention arms. No studies reported on adverse events.</P>
<P>Offering influenza vaccination to healthcare workers who care for those aged 60 or over in LTCIs may have little or no effect on laboratory-proven influenza (low quality evidence). HCW vaccination programmes probably have a small effect on lower respiratory tract infection (moderate quality evidence), but they may have little or no effect on admission to hospital (low quality evidence). It is unclear what effect vaccination programmes have on death due to lower respiratory tract illness (very low quality evidence) or all cause deaths (very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>This review did not find information on other interventions used in conjunction with vaccination of healthcare workers (for example, hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding new admissions, prompt antiviral use, asking healthcare workers with an influenza-like illness not to work). High quality randomised controlled trials testing combinations of these interventions are needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-05-30 09:32:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-09 15:00:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Roger E Thomas">
<P>A systematic review found that 3% of working adults who had received influenza vaccine and 5% of those who were unvaccinated had laboratory-proven influenza per season; in healthcare workers (HCWs) these percentages were 5% and 8% respectively. Healthcare workers may transmit influenza to patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-26 17:20:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>To identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the effects of vaccinating healthcare workers on the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, death from pneumonia and admission to hospital for respiratory illness in those aged 60 years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 22:12:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to October 2015) and Web of Science (2006 to October 2015), but Biological Abstracts only from 1969 to March 2013 and Science Citation Index-Expanded from 1974 to March 2013 due to lack of institutional access in 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-05 18:19:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of influenza vaccination of healthcare workers caring for individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs and the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract infection) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-03-12 02:46:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Effects on dichotomous outcomes were measured as risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-30 09:31:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We identified four cluster-RCTs and one cohort study (n = 12,742) of influenza vaccination for HCWs caring for individuals &#8805; 60 years in LTCIs. Four cluster RCTs (5896 residents) provided outcome data that addressed the objectives of our review. The studies were comparable in their study populations, intervention and outcome measures. The studies did not report adverse events. The principal sources of bias in the studies related to attrition, lack of blinding, contamination in the control groups and low rates of vaccination coverage in the intervention arms, leading us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes due to serious risk of bias.</P>
<P>Offering influenza vaccination to HCWs based in long term care homes may have little or no effect on the number of residents who develop laboratory-proven influenza compared with those living in care homes where no vaccination is offered (RD 0 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.03), two studies with samples taken from 752 participants; low quality evidence). HCW vaccination probably leads to a reduction in lower respiratory tract infection in residents from 6% to 4% (RD -0.02 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.01), one study of 3400 people; moderate quality evidence). HCW vaccination programmes may have little or no effect on the number of residents admitted to hospital for respiratory illness (RD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, one study of 1059 people; low quality evidence). We decided not to combine data on deaths from lower respiratory tract infection (two studies of 4459 people) or all cause deaths (four studies of 8468 people). The direction and size of difference in risk varied between the studies. We are uncertain as to the effect of vaccination on these outcomes due to the very low quality of evidence. Adjusted analyses, which took into account the cluster design, did not differ substantively from the pooled analysis with unadjusted data.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-05-30 09:32:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Our review findings have not identified conclusive evidence of benefit of HCW vaccination programmes on specific outcomes of laboratory-proven influenza, its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract illness), or all cause mortality in people over the age of 60 who live in care institutions. This review did not find information on co-interventions with healthcare worker vaccination: hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, antivirals and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) not to work. This review does not provide reasonable evidence to support the vaccination of healthcare workers to prevent influenza in those aged 60 years or older resident in LTCIs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review and to test further these interventions in combination.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Healthcare workers, such as doctors, nurses, other health professionals, cleaners and porters (and also family visitors), may have substantial rates of clinical and sub-clinical influenza during influenza seasons (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruel 2002</LINK>). Laboratory-proven influenza in the general population on average accounts for a small proportion of 'influenza-like illnesses'. A systematic review of 29 observational studies with 58,245 participants during 97 influenza seasons found that 3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79% to 5.15%) of vaccinated working adults had a symptomatic influenza infection (tested by serology) per influenza season. Among vaccinated healthcare workers 4.8% (95% CI 3.23% to 7.16%) had an influenza infection per influenza season. Of unvaccinated working adults 5.12% (95% CI 3.08% to 8.52%) had an influenza infection per season; in unvaccinated HCWs this was 7.54% (95% CI 4.86% to 11.70%) (<LINK REF="REF-Kuster-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuster 2011</LINK>). </P>
<P>Healthcare workers often continue to work when infected with influenza, increasing the likelihood of transmitting influenza to those in their care (<LINK REF="REF-Coles-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coles 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weingarten-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weingarten 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 1993</LINK>). However, a review of infection transmission in hospitals was unable to provide numerical data for influenza transmission by HCWs (<LINK REF="REF-Sydnor-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydnor 2014</LINK>). Those aged 60 or older in institutions such as long-stay hospital wards and nursing homes are at risk of influenza and its complications, especially if affected with multiple pathologies (<LINK REF="REF-Fune-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fune 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muder 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolle 1984</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>One way to prevent the spread of influenza to those aged 60 years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs) may be to vaccinate healthcare workers. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination of all healthcare workers (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2004</LINK>). However, only 36% of healthcare workers in the US were vaccinated in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2003</LINK>), 35% of staff in LTCIs in Canada were vaccinated in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 2001</LINK>), and 34% to 44% after a RCT in 43 geriatric healthcare settings in France to increase vaccination rates (<LINK REF="REF-Rothan_x002d_Tondeur-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothan-Tondeur 2010</LINK>). Nurses and (in some institutions) physicians, tend to have lower influenza vaccination rates than other healthcare workers. This relatively low uptake may partly be a reflection of doubts as to the vaccine's ability to prevent influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Ballada-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballada 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campos-2002_x002d_3" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos 2002-3</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludwig_x002d_Beymer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig-Beymer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinello-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinello 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quereshi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quereshi 2004</LINK>). The design and execution of campaigns to increase vaccination rates are also important (<LINK REF="REF-Doebbeling-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doebbeling 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NFID-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NFID 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2003b</LINK>), in order to provide an intervention at minimal risk of bias from inadequate randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding, attrition, incomplete reporting and inappropriate statistical analysis.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 22:12:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Healthcare workers are the key group who enter nursing and LTCIs on a daily basis. The immune systems of the elderly are less responsive to vaccination and vaccinating healthcare workers could reduce the exposure of those aged 60 years or older to influenza.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-25 22:12:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous systematic reviews of the effects of influenza vaccines in those aged 60 years or older are now out of date or do not include all relevant studies.

The <LINK REF="REF-Vu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vu 2002</LINK> review has methodological weaknesses (excluding studies with denominators smaller than 30 and quantitative pooling of studies with different designs), which are likely to undermine the conclusions. A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2004</LINK> of the effects of vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza on high-risk individual elderly reports significantly lower mortality in the elderly (13.6% versus 22.4%, odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.84) but does not include the latest studies. The <LINK REF="REF-Burls-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burls 2006</LINK> systematic review of the effects on elderly people only identified the RCTs by <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carman 2000</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Anikeeva-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anikeeva 2009</LINK> does not include the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lemaitre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lemaitre 2009</LINK>.

<P>We carried out assessment of methodological quality for RCTs using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the quality of non-RCTs in relation to the presence of potential confounders using the appropriate Newcastle-Ottawa Scales (NOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2005</LINK>). The NOS asks whether all possible precautions against confounding have been taken by the study designers and links study quality to the answer. We translated the number of inadequately reported or conducted items into categories of risk of bias. We used quality at the analysis stage as a means of interpreting the results.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-05-20 09:00:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We assessed efficacy against laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, deaths from pneumonia and hospitalisation using risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We chose to analyse the data as risk differences. The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) was computed as 1/RD.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-05-19 20:35:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All three RCTs that provided outcome data that met our criteria had a cluster design. We adjusted the study estimates for cluster-RCTs by dividing the events and sample sizes in each treatment group with the study design effect. to derive the 'effective sample size'. This was based on formulae described in full in Chapter 16 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This generates a design effect based on the intracluster correlation coefficient and average cluster size. The design effect used to for each study is given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
<P>In previous versions of this review we used generic inverse variance outcome types to analyse trial effect estimates for rates of events or risk of odds ratios as available from the included studies.

<P>One author assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.

We used methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and used GRADEpro GDT software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK>) to rate the quality of evidence. Downgrading decisions for the randomised trial evidence resulted in one of four quality ratings (high, moderate, low or very low) depending on the number of levels the evidence was downgraded. We justified all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of studies using footnotes in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, and we made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.</P>

<P>A search on 27 October 2015 identified 153 RCTs and 236 observational studies. A search in clinical trials registries on 27 January 2016 identified 11 citations but no new studies were included in this update. Neither the 2013 nor the 2009 searches identified new RCTs for inclusion.</P>
<P>The 2015, 2013 and 2009 searches (with duplicate results) in total identified 2825 papers (766 RCTs, 2059 observational studies) and (with duplicates removed) 1841 papers (383 RCTs, 1443 observational studies).</P>
<P>In the first publication of this review we also examined 312 reports for detailed assessment from the review on the effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2010</LINK>). Due to the comprehensive nature of this Cochrane review we carried out a review with a very focused study question and benefited from extensive searches, which generated a large number of 'hits' but a relatively low yield of studies to include.</P>

Two studies that were in the second publication no longer contribute outcome data to this review: one cluster-RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hayward-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hayward 2006</LINK>), because the main outcome measure was all-cause mortality and the secondary measure was ILI; and a cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Oshitani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oshitani 2000</LINK>), which used ILI as the outcome measure.</P>

<LI>Selection bias: the total number of long-term care hospitals in West and Central Scotland is not stated. There were inconsistencies in outcome gradients (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In the population under observation, <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK> reported 216 cases of suspected viral illness, 64 cases of influenza-like illness, 55 cases of pneumonia, 72 deaths from pneumonia and 148 deaths from all causes. In the sub-population of both vaccinated staff and patients, <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK> reported 24 cases of suspected viral illness, two cases of influenza-like illness, seven cases of pneumonia, 10 deaths from pneumonia and 25 deaths from all causes. As these gradients are not plausible (one would expect a greater proportion of cases of influenza-like illness to be caused by influenza during a period of high viral activity), the effect on all-cause mortality is likely to reflect a selection bias rather than a real effect of vaccination.</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We identified four cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which met our criteria for outcome data to answer the question of whether vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza protects those aged 60 years or older residing in long-term care institutions (LTCIs).</P>
<P>Pooled data showed no effect on specific outcomes: laboratory-proven influenza (<LINK REF="STD-Carman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK>), lower respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK>), admissions to hospital for lower respiratory tract illness (<LINK REF="STD-Lemaitre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lemaitre 2009</LINK>), and deaths from lower respiratory tract illness (<LINK REF="STD-Lemaitre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lemaitre 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK>), with the 95% confidence interval (CI) in each case including unity.</P>
<P>One question is what the maximum contribution that influenza vaccination of people aged 60 years or older could make in reducing total annual mortality. A population study by <LINK REF="REF-Simonsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsen 2006</LINK> used data from the US national multiple-cause-of-death databases from 1968 to 2001 and found that for those aged 65 years or older, mortality attributable to pneumonia or influenza never exceeded 10% of all deaths during those winters. The study by <LINK REF="REF-Vila_x002d_C_x00f3_rcoles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vila-Córcoles 2007</LINK> of 11,240 Spanish community-dwelling elderly, conducted between January 2002 and April 2005, found the attributable mortality risk in individuals not vaccinated against influenza was 24 deaths/100,000 person-weeks within influenza periods. Vaccination prevented 14% of these deaths for the population and one death was prevented for every 239 annual vaccinations (ranging from 144 in winter 2005 to 1748 in winter 2002). It should be noted that these data are not for residents of LTCIs. A mathematical model predicted that for a 30-bed unit, an increase in healthcare worker vaccination rates from 0% to 100% would decrease resident influenza infections by 60% (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Dool-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Dool 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-05 22:35:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We identified three cluster-RCTs that provided outcome data that met our criteria. Pooled data showed that there was no effect on laboratory-proven influenza, lower respiratory tract infections, admissions to hospital for respiratory illness or deaths from respiratory illness.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Four cluster-RCTs focused directly on the question of the effect of healthcare worker vaccination on the mortality and morbidity of long-term care facility residents aged 60 years or older. The cluster-RCTs have certain common features: they are all underpowered to detect any difference in influenza mortality, which is a rare event. All participants, were they residents or carers, were unblinded to their intervention status. All trials showed no reduction in influenza or its complications (the registered indication for the vaccines). Our review has yielded no clear indication of benefit on specific outcome measures of influenza. It is noteworthy that the studies did report significant results for a syndrome (influenza-like illness - ILI), which is caused only in part by influenza viruses. The absence of usable outcome data for the specific effects of healthcare worker vaccination programmes from <LINK REF="STD-Hayward-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hayward 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oshitani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oshitani 2000</LINK> restricts the applicability of our findings further.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-05-20 08:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We downgraded the quality of evidence for each outcome due to risk of bias (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). A key uncertainty for the outcomes of influenza and hospital admission due to respiratory infection is low power, prompting us to downgrade for imprecision. The analysis of both adjusted and unadjusted study results for three of the four outcomes of interest were consistent with each other. We considered the inconsistency in the size and direction of the risk differences for cause specific and non-specific mortality to be very serious. We decided not to combine the data for these outcomes. However, the high I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic observed for the outcomes of influenza-related mortality and mortality due to any cause were lower after recalculating the events and sample sizes to take account of the design effect . We discuss the consequences of our choice of effect measure below.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-02-25 22:12:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are aware of two important features of our approach that could have influenced our results and conclusions. Firstly, the high degree of statistical heterogeneity for the outcome of influenza-related mortality may reflect the decision to use risk difference. As an absolute measure of effect risk difference is less likely to be stable across the different studies than relative measures such as odds or risk ratios. Secondly, the intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) we used for two of the studies were based on the estimate provided by <LINK REF="STD-Hayward-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hayward 2006</LINK>. Although the recalculation of the effective sample size was done in accordance with recommended procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we have assumed that the adjustment required is the same across the outcomes extracted for each study.</P>

<I>very low</I>
</B> (italics in original, bolding added), which is compatible with our assessments although we have downgraded for different reasons (see below). The evidence for non-specific outcomes was graded as moderate quality.</P>
<P>Ahmed included three observational studies that we excluded: <LINK REF="STD-B_x00e9_net-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bénet 2012</LINK> (cannot separate outcomes for those <U>&gt;</U> 60), <LINK REF="STD-Enserink-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enserink 2011</LINK> (outcome measure is ILI) and <LINK REF="STD-Wendelboe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wendelboe 2011</LINK> (problems in design and execution such that the results cannot be relied on). Both our review and Ahmed's used laboratory-confirmed influenza as an outcome. However, the other outcomes we assessed were specific to influenza (hospitalisation for influenza and deaths from influenza) whereas Ahmed used non-specific outcomes (all-cause hospitalisation and all-cause deaths). We also assessed lower respiratory tract infection. None of our outcome measures had statistically significant results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-05-30 09:32:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The four cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) contributing outcome data to our review are at high risk of bias and pooled data have not shown convincing evidence of benefit on the outcomes of direct interest, namely laboratory-proven influenza (low quality evidence), lower respiratory tract infections (moderate quality evidence), admissions to hospital (low quality evidence), and deaths from lower respiratory tract illness or from all causes (very low quality evidence). Where meta-analysis was possible the 95% confidence interval (CI) in each case has not excluded little or no effect of vaccination programmes. We conclude that there is an absence of high quality evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza protects people aged 60 years or older in their care on influenza-specific outcomes. There is little evidence to justify medical care and public health practitioners mandating influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for the elderly in long-term care institutions (LTCIs).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-25 22:12:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are currently only three cluster-RCTS that provide outcome data that meet our criteria to evaluate the impact on residents aged 60 years or older of vaccinating their healthcare workers against influenza. All of these studies are at high risk of bias. RCTs are needed with minimal risk of bias from sequence generation, failure to conceal allocation, and performance, attrition and detection bias and these should be adequately powered for the key outcomes of laboratory-proven influenza, hospitalisation for pneumonia and death from pneumonia. They should carefully define and measure outcomes including laboratory-proven influenza, lower respiratory tract infection, cause of hospitalisation and deaths from pneumonia. They should carefully consider the degree to which they must, to adequately assess outcomes, obtain proof of diagnosis for all participants by laboratory testing all participants with appropriate symptoms for influenza and all other likely viruses, performing blood cultures, white blood cell counts and other laboratory investigations and chest X-rays if pneumonia is suspected, and following the course of all hospitalised patients by scrutinising individual records so that they can definitively assess all outcomes and co-morbidities. A particular issue in the analysis of data from studies with a cluster design is the provision and use of an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC). It is a major limitation with the analysis of data in our review that we have not had available a reliable estimate of this quantity for each of the outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>The area of interest is those aged 60 years or older in LTCIs. Therefore, if the existing LTCIs' organisational structure is to be used to implement the interventions, these will need to be given to clusters of residents aged 60 years or older and healthcare workers, which will make blinding difficult. An important ethical issue is informed consent by those aged 60 years or older and healthcare workers. It is not ethical to blind participants or healthcare workers but the researchers, data assessors and statisticians could all be blinded.</P>
<P>The elderly are much keener to be vaccinated than healthcare workers and there is extensive literature about the group of healthcare workers who say they do not feel vulnerable to influenza, do not believe the vaccine is effective and are afraid of side effects, and some of these do not perceive risk for their patients. Persistence of these beliefs may limit uptake by healthcare workers and make it difficult to test conclusively the effect of very high levels of healthcare worker influenza vaccination.</P>
<P>A large publicly funded trial is needed to test combinations of interventions to reduce influenza and mortality from influenza in those aged 60 years or older in LTCIs with thorough delivery of each intervention: vaccinating residents and healthcare workers, hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza in individuals with influenza-like illness by using nasal swabs, quarantine of floors and entire LTCIs during outbreaks, avoiding new admissions, prompt use of antivirals and asking healthcare workers with an influenza-like illness not to present for work.</P>

<P>Purpose: to assess the effects of staff vaccination against influenza on resident mortality in long-term care hospitals</P>
<P>Design: cluster-randomised study (C-RCT) conducted in Scotland during the 1996 to 1997 influenza season. The study identified 10 long-term care geriatric hospitals in West and Central Scotland with a policy of vaccinating all patients against influenza if they had no contraindications and then only on the request of the patients or their relatives. Pairs of hospitals in each of these clusters were matched on patient enrolment and then in a Latin square design were randomised by a table of random numbers for the HCWs to be offered influenza vaccination or not</P>
<P>Anonymous questionnaires were sent to ward nurses on 31 March 1997 to ask if they had received influenza vaccination and these data were used to estimate vaccine acceptance for all HCWs in hospitals where influenza vaccine had not been offered to HCWs. In each hospital a random sample chosen by computer of 50% patients was selected for virological monitoring</P>
<P>Data from the Scottish Centre for Infection and Epidemiological Health and from GPs were used to define the start of the influenza season. Combined nasal and throat swabs were taken from patients every 2 weeks from 14 December 1996 to 14 February 1997. Opportunistic samples were also taken from patients whom the ward nurses thought had influenza. Samples were taken within 12 hours of death of any patient who died. Samples were analysed by RT-PCR analysis</P>
<P>Results were summarised for the 2 groups of LTCIs. Hospitals were not well-matched for patient vaccination rates and Barthel scores (<LINK REF="REF-Wikipedia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wikipedia 2009</LINK>) and post-hoc statistical adjustments could not be made because of missing data. The outcome was the empirical logic of mortality for each cluster (= natural logarithm of the odds on death)</P>
<P>Statistics: the power calculation was based on the previous study by <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK> and the authors computed that with 1600 patients in 20 hospitals they would have &#8805; 80% power to detect a decrease in mortality from 15% to 10% with alpha = 0.05 (2-tailed), allowing for the clustered design. The power calculation for virological sampling showed that 500 patients would be required to give 80% power at 5% significance (2-tailed) to detect a decrease in influenza infection from 25% to 15%</P>
<P>Mortality rates were compared in the 2 groups with the Mann-Whitney test. "Incomplete data for patient-level covariates meant that a full multilevel approach to the analysis was not possible without making strong, implausible and untestable assumptions about the mechanisms that led to the incomplete data. Instead, we calculated summary statistics to describe the mix of patients in each hospital and these values were included in a multiple linear-regression analysis. The response variable in these analyses was the empirical logit of each hospital's mortality rate that is, the natural logarithm of the odds on death."</P>

<P>Purpose: to increase staff vaccination rates in care homes by adoption of a policy to encourage staff to be vaccinated against influenza and providing vaccination clinics</P>
<P>
<BR/>Design: C-RCT; 48 nursing homes were placed in matched pairs (by size of home, % of high dependency and mortality of residents) within 3 regions (northern, central and southern England), then the 25 homes that most closely matched were selected and randomised by a researcher, blinded to the home's identity and characteristics, using a table of random numbers. Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel surveillance scheme were used to divide the study into periods of influenza activity and no influenza activity</P>
<P>
<BR/>Duration of study: 3 November 2003 to 28 March 2004 and 1 November 2004 to 27 March 2005<BR/>
<BR/>Interval between intervention and when outcome was measured: 3 November 2003 to 28 March 2004 and 1 November 2004 to 27 March 2005<BR/>
<BR/>Power computation: to detect reduction in all-cause mortality of residents from 15% to 10% (intra-cluster variance = 2.3%) with 90% power and alpha = 0.05% level required 20 pairs of homes each with an average of 20 residents (based on findings from pilot study)<BR/>
<BR/>Statistics: outcomes were analysed using aggregate data for each cluster and "to take account of the matched clustered design we used a random-effects meta-analysis. This treated the results from each pair of homes as a separate study and provided a pooled estimate of effect weighted for the size of homes and the size of the effects and their standard errors." "When significant protection of residents was observed we calculated the number of staff vaccinations needed to prevent one event in residents (number needed to treat) as number of vaccinations given in all intervention homes divided by the average number of residents in all intervention homes multiplied by the weighted rate difference."</P>

<P>Purpose: to assess the effect of staff and resident influenza vaccination on resident all-cause mortality</P>
<P>Design: C-RCT. A written invitation was sent to the 376 nursing homes with 50 to 200 elderly people (out of a total 1105 nursing homes) in the Paris area and 88 responded. Of these, 40 with staff influenza coverage &lt; 40% during the 2005 to 2006 winter season were selected. Each institution was pair-matched on size, staff vaccination coverage 2005 to 2006 and Group Iso Resources (GIR) weighted average disability score (which ranges from 1 = severe disability to 6 = total autonomy). Randomisation was centrally based using a random number generator</P>
<P>Statistics: it was assumed that the influenza epidemic would last 2 months, mortality would be 8% in the control arm and resident mortality would be reduced 40% after staff vaccination to 4.8% in the intervention arm. 20 pairs of nursing homes with 2000 residents in each group were required to obtain 80% power with 2-tailed hypothesis testing. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. "Odds ratios were calculated using alternating logistic regression, with one-nested log odds ratios to model the association between the responses of the same pair and the same nursing home within the pair." "In secondary analyses, multivariate estimates were adjusted for the residents' age, vaccination status, GIR disability score and Charlson comorbidity index."</P>

<P>Design: 6 geriatric long-stay hospitals in Glasgow in 1994 had an "opt-out" policy in which patients were routinely given influenza vaccine unless they refused it or had a major contraindication and 6 had an "opt-in" policy in which patients were given vaccine only if they or their relatives requested it following advertisement on the ward that it was available</P>
<P>Hospitals were stratified by policy on vaccination then randomised for their HCWs to be "routinely offered either influenza vaccination or no vaccination." Study conducted in Scotland, during the 1994 to 1995 influenza season, in the community. Follow-up period was 1 October 1994 to 31 March 1995. 12 hospitals were randomly allocated to offer vaccination of HCWs or not; facilities were grouped according to the vaccination policy. The vaccination of staff and patients was voluntary. The study thus presents data on 4 sub-populations:</P>
<P>- staff and patients not vaccinated (S0P0)<BR/>- staff not vaccinated, patients vaccinated (S0PV)<BR/>- staff and patients vaccinated (SVPV)<BR/>- staff vaccinated and patients not vaccinated (SVP0)</P>
<P>Statistical analysis: "Baseline characteristics, morbidity and mortality in the 4 groups of hospitals were compared using the X<SUP>2</SUP> test, unpaired Student's test and Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for the effects of staff and patient vaccination. Survival analysis was by Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates, using the Tarone Ware test for statistical significance. Cluster analysis, examining mortality rates and other outcomes by hospital site, was also done."</P>

<P>75 long-term care facilities in New Mexico, US, during the influenza seasons of 2006-7 and 2007-8. 12% (9 homes) provided no reports in 2006-7 and 18% (which computes as 13.5 homes!) no reports in 2007-8. However, data are presented for all 75 homes (15 homes which had an outbreak and 50 which had none). An influenza outbreak was defined as a single patient case. Cases were diagnosed by viral culture or a rapid antigen test</P>
<P>The authors noted that: "The ecologic study design limits our ability to control for certain characteristics such as the distribution of residents&#8217; ages and the presence of comorbidities&#8230; For example, it is possible that certain facilities cared for residents in poorer health, which likely resulted in those patients who were vaccinated against influenza being less effectively protected from influenza by vaccination." The authors also noted that: "Another potential limitation is that we restricted our surveillance to HCWs with direct patient care. Future surveillance systems may find it helpful to include all healthcare personnel (including clerical, dietary, housekeeping, maintenance, and volunteer personnel)&#8230;"</P>
<P>There were no data on the total number of patients during the 2 years. The odds of an "outbreak" were paradoxically higher with resident vaccination rates of 91% to 100% compared to 0% to 90% (OR 4.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 20.18) implying more vulnerable patients were more likely to be vaccinated. The authors computed an adjusted OR of 0.76 (0.62 to 0.93) for a reduction in "outbreaks" for a 10% increase in HCW vaccination. However, with only 21 cases and an unknown denominator it is inappropriate to place weight on the odds ratios computed for the effects of HCW vaccination. This is not a RCT and is subject to unmeasured confounders such as a superior LCT culture, which limits the transmission of influenza by hand-washing, quarantining patients and limiting visitors</P>

There were inconsistencies in outcome gradients (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In the population under observation, <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK> reported 216 cases of suspected viral illness, 64 cases of ILI, 55 cases of pneumonia, 72 deaths from pneumonia and 148 deaths from all causes; in the sub-population of both vaccinated staff and patients, <LINK REF="STD-Potter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 1997</LINK> reported 24 cases of suspected viral illness, 2 cases of ILI, 7 cases of pneumonia, 10 deaths from pneumonia and 25 deaths from all causes. As these gradients are not plausible, the effect on all-cause mortality is likely to reflect a selection bias rather than a real effect of vaccination</LI>
<LI>Performance bias: 67% of staff in active arm 1 and 43% in active arm 2 were vaccinated</LI>
<LI>There is no description of the vaccines administered, vaccine matching or background influenza epidemiology</LI>

<P>Dear Thomas et al,</P>
<P>Working with colleagues from PHE England we have just conducted an appraisal of all systematic reviews relevant to vaccinating healthcare workers in the UK. The rationale for this analysis was ongoing uncertainty among healthcare workers about the rational and evidence base for the current policy.</P>
<P>We included nine systematic reviews, including the Cochrane review &#8216;Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for people aged 60 or older living in long-term care institutions&#8217;.</P>
<P>We are concerned by the decision of the authors of the current Cochrane review to exclude two outcomes included in previous versions of their review, and disagree with the rationale they presented. The fact that these were the only two outcomes presenting statistically significant and clinically important results leaves the authors open to criticisms of academic bias.</P>
<P>While we accept that the outcomes &#8216;clinically suspected influenza&#8217; and &#8216;all-cause mortality&#8217; are less specific than &#8216;proven influenza&#8217; and &#8216;influenza-related mortality&#8217;, there are good reasons for trial authors to choose these outcomes as they are easier to measure, and exclusion of this data from the review is unhelpful to policy makers and healthcare workers.</P>
<P>Policy makers using Cochrane reviews, require a transparent summary of the evidence for all policy relevant outcomes accompanied by an appraisal of the quality of that evidence. We believe that decisions about the relative importance of different outcomes, or the validity of different effects, should not be made by authors, whose job it is to summarise the available evidence, and then use formal processes such as GRADE to assess the certainty around the estimates.</P>
<P>Rather than adding clarity and transparency to the situation, we think that this decision by the Cochrane authors has added further confusion, and it would help policy makers to include these outcomes in the review.</P>
<P>I agree with the conflict of interest statement below:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>

<P>Thank you for your comment. We reached the decision to exclude the non-specific outcomes prior to the last version of the review for reasons which we summarise here. A review of estimates of influenza-associated mortality in those &#8805; 65 in statistical databases found that: (1) for studies which compared different statistical models &#8220;For four studies Poisson and ARIMA models produced higher estimates than Serfling, and Serfling higher than GLM. Which model is more accurate is unknown.&#8221; and (2) concluded that in estimating mortality from influenza: &#8220;Key problems are insufficient testing for influenza, using influenza-like illness, heterogeneity of seasonal and pandemic influenza, population aging, and incomplete confounder control (co-morbidities, frailty, vaccination history) &#8230;&#8221; (Thomas RE, Vaccine 2014;32:6884-6901).</P>
<P>We provide further elaboration on the reasons not to use ILI in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> to support our view that ILI is not an acceptable outcome measure. However, we have decided to reinstate the outcome of mortality since we recognise that decision-makers will be interested to assess how far this outcome might be affected by vaccines. Since there will be some interest in the outcomes we provide below a table that reports the previous findings of this review for the outcomes of ILI with the original odds ratios:<BR/>

<P>
<B>Influenza-like illness (ILI)</B>
</P>
<P>We believe that there are seven reasons not to use ILI as an outcome.</P>
<OL>
<LI>There are multiple definitions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition is a temperature &#8805; 38°C, cough or sore throat or both and the absence of a known cause other than influenza (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>). Health Canada's Flu Watch uses fever, cough and &#8805; one of sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia or prostration (<A HREF="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch">www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch</A>).</LI>
<LI>The percentage of ILI cases that are laboratory-proven influenza cases is low. During the 2009 H1N1p pandemic in Marseille, GPs assessed 660 patients as ILI cases: 158 were positive for A/H1N1p. Of the 502 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza-negative patients 296 were randomly selected for further testing: 82 were positive for at least one other virus (58 human rhinovirus, nine parainfluenza viruses 1-4, nine human coronavirus OC43, five enterovirus, four adenovirus and two human metapneumovirus) and 204 were negative for all 18 viruses tested (<LINK REF="REF-Thiberville-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiberville 2012</LINK>). A RCT in 46 Hutterite colonies in Canada defined ILI as fever &#8805; 38°C, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headaches, sinus problems, muscle ache, fatigue, ear ache and chills but only 37 (26%) of 142 tested were PCR positive (<LINK REF="REF-Barbara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbara 2012</LINK>). A study in India defined ILI as sudden onset of fever &gt; 38°C or a history of sudden onset of fever in the recent past (&lt; three days), cough or sore throat and/or rhinorrhoea and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) as an ILI with breathlessness or difficulty in breathing/tachypnoea or clinically suspected pneumonia (in children) with increased respiratory rates. They isolated influenza from only 617 (4.43%) of 13,928 throat or nasal swabs (<LINK REF="REF-Chadha-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadha 2011</LINK>). A study in Taiwan of 26,601 ILI cases found influenza in only 25% by viral culture or RT-PCR (<LINK REF="REF-Chuang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuang 2012</LINK>). </LI>
<LI>A review of 25 studies in which physicians had diagnosed patients as having ILI found in most studies &lt; 25% are RT-PCR positive, some patients had adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or multiple respiratory viruses, or bacteria, and 50% identified no pathogen (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>There is a remarkable similarity between the symptoms of influenza A/H1N1p and human rhinovirus. Of the 660 patients in Marseille, 85% had a fever (91% H1N1p, 79% HRV), 83% had a cough (97%, 86%), 75% had ILI symptoms (89%, 74%), 65% a sore throat (65%, 69%), 93% asthenia (96%, 88%), 80% myalgia (80%, 74%), 63% rhinorrhoea (74%, 81%), 77% headache (78%, 69%), 65% chills (74%, 52%), 40% arthralgia (41%, 31%) and 35% nausea (39%, 23%) (<LINK REF="REF-Thiberville-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiberville 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Some studies use ILI in circular definitions resulting in unclear outcomes. The Australian Flutracking programme defined ILI as the proportion of participants in their programme who had both fever and cough during the peak influenza period for each year 2007 to 2009. In a completely circular manner the peak influenza period was defined as the four consecutive weeks with the highest Flutracking ILI rates. No analysis was performed of whether any symptom correlated with laboratory-proven influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Dalton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalton 2011</LINK>). A study of "influenza activity" in Hong Kong also achieved circularity by confounding together the laboratory proven influenza rate and the ILI rate: "The product of the laboratory influenza detection rate and the GP ILI consultation rate was used as the reference standard indicator of influenza virus activity, rather than the laboratory data alone which suffer from denominator dilution during periods of non-influenza epidemics and the GP ILI data alone which suffer from numerator dilution because not all ILI episodes are associated with influenza" (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2012</LINK>).  </LI>
<LI>Some studies argue that multiple viral activity databases which may have peaks at similar times measure the same phenomenon. A study in Singapore during the 2009 pandemic defined ILI by the WHO criteria, plus new onset respiratory symptoms and temperature &gt; 38°C and multiplied the rate of ILI cases diagnosed by 23 sentinel GPs (n of patients not stated) by the &#8220;relative proportion of ILI seen by the average GP" and thereby estimated the ILI rate at 15% (Bayesian credible intervals 10%, 25%). A separate serological study of samples from 727 adult patients four weeks before, four weeks after the epidemic peak and four weeks after the epidemic subsided estimated the influenza rate at 17% (BCI 14%, 20%) and the two rates were presented as confirming each other. There was no relationship between the two samples, which were merely used to attempt estimates of the rate of ILI and influenza activity during the epidemic and no assessment was made of the utility of the ILI definition (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2011</LINK>). A study of "influenza activity" during 166 weeks in the US 2003-8 compared the CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (which uses the CDC ILI definition and a network of "health care providers"), Google Flu Trends (weekly percentage of persons seeking health care with ILI) and the CDC Influenza Virologic Surveillance System. The Pearson correlation coefficient between Google Flu trends and CDC Virus surveillance was 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.79) and with CDC ILI surveillance was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.96) and between the two CDC databases 0.85 (0.81 to 0.89). There was no attempt to identify individuals across all three databases and no assessment of the utility of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Influenza rapid diagnostic tests have low sensitivity. There is an increasing tendency to use rapid influenza diagnostic tests for ILI cases. A review of 159 studies evaluating 26 rapid influenza diagnostic tests found the pooled sensitivity was 62.3% (95% CI 57.9% to 66.6%) and specificity 98% (97.5% to 98.7%), with lower sensitivity in adults 53.9% (47.9% to 59.8%). If these are used to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccines further inaccuracy will be introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Chartrand-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chartrand 2012</LINK>).</LI>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-12 01:54:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>All-cause mortality</B>
</P>
<P>There are three reasons not use all-cause mortality to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccine.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Mortality attributable to influenza is a small proportion of all deaths. For those aged &#8805; 65 in the US national multiple-cause-of-death databases 1968 to 2001 mortality attributable to pneumonia or influenza never exceeded 10% of all winter deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Simonsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsen 2006</LINK>). All-cause deaths could be subject to considerable bias and fluctuations as an estimate of influenza mortality.</LI>
<LI>The number of nursing home residents with proven respiratory infections is low. A unique inclusive prospective study in France of 44,869 nursing home residents aged &#8805; 65 found &lt; 4.5% of the nursing home residents studied had an upper or lower respiratory tract infection, with 1.31% definite (95% CI 1.09 to 1.68) (using McGeer's consensus definition, which is a physician diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-McGeer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGeer 1991</LINK>)) and 3.34% probable (2.88 to 3.87). Influenza vaccine had been received by 93.4% of the patients and pneumococcal vaccine by 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Chami-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chami 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Many cases of "influenza" are not laboratory-proven and are not recorded on death certificates. Three statistical approaches have attempted to use existing databases to predict mortality due to influenza.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>The first assumes all differences in mortality comparing virus and non-virus seasons are due to influenza. A study in France using data from a sentinel network of GPs estimated only 3.35% (176,053) of all 5,295,480 deaths from 1998 to 2007 were due to ILI and 2.14% (113,240) due to cold spells. Mortality in the four winter months correlated with reported ILI (r = 0.75, P value = 0.02) (<LINK REF="REF-Pin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pin 2012</LINK>). A study in the US and Japan had similar findings (<LINK REF="REF-Charu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charu 2011</LINK>). Mortality due to influenza cannot be estimated from these ILI data.</LI>
<LI>The second distributes "influenza related deaths" among co-morbidities. A study of weekly mortality data from the US National Health Statistics database 1997 to 2007 attributed an average of 11.92 (95% CI 10.1 to 13.6) deaths/100,000 to influenza, with 9.41 (8.3 to 10.5) to A/H3N2 years and 2.51 to influenza B years. These 11.92 deaths/100,000 ascribed to influenza were then further partitioned into: all circulatory causes 4.6 (3.79 to 5.39), all respiratory 3.58 (3.04 to 4.14), cancer 0.87 (0.68 to 1.05), diabetes 0.33 (0.26 to 0.39), renal disease 0.19 (0.14 to 0.24), CNS 0.42 (0.31 to 0.53) and Alzheimer&#8217;s 0.41 (0.3 to 0.52) and the authors concluded that 69% of the "influenza associated mortality" was attributable to circulatory and respiratory causes (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2012</LINK>). A study in the US and South Africa estimated excess deaths over baseline winter deaths as 16% for South Africa and 6% for the US. Within co-morbidity diagnoses the percentage of excess deaths over baseline winter deaths for all respiratory causes was estimated as 25% and 14%, for pneumonia and influenza as 29% and 20%, for cerebrovascular events as 16% and 4%, for diabetes as 13% and 5% and for ischaemic heart disease as 9% and 6% (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2010</LINK>). A study in Canada assumed that recorded influenza-certified deaths substantially underrepresented influenza activity and estimated there were 3834 (1.9%) "influenza-attributable deaths" and allocated 877 to ischaemic heart disease, 563 to pneumonia, 529 to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 349 to other heart disease, 295 to cancer and 249 to stroke and then assessed whether their statistical model provided good predictions of these allocated deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Schanzer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schanzer 2007</LINK>). The precise number of deaths due to influenza cannot be known from these data and statistical methods.</LI>
<LI>The third computes a moving mortality average for the 13-month period centred on each month, assuming that these 13-month periods would be "unaffected by preceding or following epidemics." For each disease class and month the 13-month moving average is then subtracted from the observed mortality. For unpublished data 1959 to 1999 from the public use data files of the US National Center for Health Statistics the authors created a time series for each class with a common metric by converting data into z scores with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. The peak months for pneumonia and influenza coincided with those for ischaemic heart disease 34 of 40 times, with cerebrovascular disease 33 of 40 times and with diabetes 30 of 40 times. However, midwinter peaks for pneumonia and influenza, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes varied in size and differed widely in mean values and seasonal variation. As expected, the tallest peaks in mortality curves occurred during the A(H3N2) 1968/9 pandemic and were lower in years where influenza A(H1N1) and B predominated and categorisation by influenza type correctly sorted winter seasons as having low or high mortality, without requiring additional information (<LINK REF="REF-Reichert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichert 2004</LINK>). The precise number of deaths due to influenza cannot be known from these data and statistical methods.</LI>
<LI>A review of studies that used large databases to estimate mortality due to influenza identified four studies, which analysed the data with several statistical models: Poisson and ARIMA models produced higher mortality estimates than Serfling, and Serfling higher than GLM. It is unknown which model is more accurate (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014b</LINK>).</LI>
