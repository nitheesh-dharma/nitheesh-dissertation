<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-07 10:46:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms such as appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although medication and psychological treatments are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression. However, head-to-head comparisons of such drugs provide contrasting findings as to whether they are effective.</P>
<P>This review of the research on the effect of an antidepressant drug called paroxetine was conducted to shed light on the field of drug treatment for depression. In September 2012 we searched, in a wide ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials) which had been completed which compared paroxetine with any other antidepressant in treating people with depression. One hundred and fifteen studies were included in this review, with a total of 26,134 people. We grouped the studies according to the types of drug they compared paroxetine against; we then analysed the combined findings of these groups of studies.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome (number of people who responded to treatment) paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine, but less effective than mirtazapine (in the early phase: one to four weeks follow-up) and probably citalopram (at endpoint: six weeks follow-up). There was some evidence that paroxetine is less well tolerated than agomelatine and St John's Wort, as more patients allocated to paroxetine experienced at least some side effects (though this finding for St John's Wort was only based on one study). </P>
<P>In conclusion, some possibly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other antidepressants exist, but no definitive concluions can be drawn due to the limited number of studies per comparison. In addition, most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry, which means they might potentially have overestimated the effect of paroxetine. Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-20 14:56:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non-conventional agents.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-03-07 10:49:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder.</P>
<P>2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.</P>
<P>3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-03-05 14:37:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-03-28 10:56:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non-conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross-over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-03-05 17:07:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double-entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-20 14:56:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included. In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non-conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs. For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence). Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence). We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow-up (four to six months). Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum. Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-20 13:04:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings. In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data. In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine. However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point. Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-06 10:11:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent low mood and/or loss of interest and pleasure accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). This condition is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). It was the third leading cause of burden among all diseases in the year 2002, and it is expected to show a rising trend during the coming 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-06 10:11:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK> ). Paroxetine hydrochloride is a component of the class of AD known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In vitro studies suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. (<LINK REF="REF-Germann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Germann 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-06 10:12:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin (Ki = 65 pmol/L) of all SSRIs and shows an intermediate affinity profile between the other SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with regards to the norepinephrine transporter (Ki = 45 nmol/L). At higher concentrations paroxetine loses its serotonin transporter (SERT) selectivity and may therefore act as a dual serotonin/norepinephrine uptake inhibitor (SNRI), nevertheless it is necessary to administer high doses of paroxetine (40 mg/day and higher) to determine a sufficient plasma level (higher than 100 ng/mL). (<LINK REF="REF-Gibiino-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibiino 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Germann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Germann 2013</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-06 10:13:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Amongst ADs many different agents are available for the treatment of depression, including TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs, SNRIs, and other newer agents (such as agomelatine, mirtazapine, reboxetine, bupropion). During the last 20 years, AD consumption has risen dramatically worldwide, mainly because of the increasing consumption of SSRIs and newer ADs, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Ciuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuna 2004</LINK>). SSRIs are generally better tolerated than TCAs and there is evidence of similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>). However, head-to-head comparison has provided contrasting findings. Amitriptyline, for example, may have the edge over SSRIs in terms of efficacy, and individual SSRIs and SNRIs may differ in terms of efficacy and tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>). Starting from this consideration, and with the aim to shed light on the field of AD trials and treatment of major depression, a group of researchers agreed to join forces under the rubric of the Meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants Study Group (MANGA Study Group) to systematically review all available evidence for each specific newer AD to inform clinical practice and mental health policies. We have up to now completed some individual reviews (about fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Magni-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magni 2013</LINK>), duloxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2012a</LINK>), citalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2012b</LINK>), sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009a</LINK>), escitalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009b</LINK>), mirtazapine (<LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2011</LINK>), fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="REF-Omori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omori 2010</LINK>), milnacipran (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2009</LINK>), and a number of other reviews are now underway.</P>

All response rates were calculated out of the total number of randomised patients. Where more than one criterion was provided, we preferred the former criterion for judging response. We used the first criterion whenever possible, even when we needed to impute standard deviations (SDs) or response rates according to the procedures described below. We applied intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, whereby all the dropouts not included in the analyses were considered non-responders.</P>
<P>When studies reported response rates at various time points of the trial, we decided a priori to subdivide the treatment indices as follows.</P>
<P>(a) Early response: between one and four weeks; the time point closest to two weeks was given preference.<BR/>(b) Acute phase treatment response: between six and 12 weeks; the time point given in the original study as the study endpoint was given preference.<BR/>(c) Follow-up response: between four and six months; the time point closest to 24 weeks was given preference.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) registers were searched up to September, 2012. The CCDAN maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK, a references register and a studies based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 31,500 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual, please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in major depression, we only used data from the first phase of the cross-over studies.</P>

<P>When dichotomous or continuous outcomes were not reported, we asked the trial authors to supply the data.</P>

<P>For dichotomous data, odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals.

<OL>
<LI>Paroxetine dosing (fixed low dosage, fixed standard dosage, fixed high dosage; flexible low dosage, flexible standard dosage, flexible high dosage), because there is evidence to suspect that low dosage antidepressant may be associated with better outcomes both in terms of effectiveness and side effects than standard or high dosage antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Bollini-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollini 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002b</LINK>) and also because fixed versus flexible dosing schedule may affect estimates of treatment effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>).</LI>

<P>At the end of the reviewing process, 94 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. For efficacy outcomes, 76 RCTs provided continuous data, and 81 dichotomous data. For acceptability outcomes, 94 RCTs provided data on total dropouts, 61 on dropouts due to inefficacy and 78 on dropouts due to side effects. In the majority of trials (93 out of 115, 81%) the HDRS scale was used for reporting outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall, 15,863 patients were included in the efficacy analysis, dichotomous outcome (7776 participants randomised to paroxetine and 8087 randomised to another antidepressant) and 14,637 were included in the efficacy analysis, continuous outcome (7326 participants randomised to paroxetine and 7311 randomised to another antidepressant). A total of 18,658 patients were included in the acceptability analysis (9037 partIcipants randomised to paroxetine and 9621 randomised to another antidepressant).</P>

<P>Our judgment about the overall risk of bias in the individual studies is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. The Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool highlighted poor reporting for a number of items in many of the included studies, although judging articles from some time ago by today&#8217;s standards can be problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2012</LINK>). Moreover, many articles failed to report methodologically relevant information on study procedure (in these cases the judgement was defined as "unclear"). In general, the reporting of studies was not good. This type of reporting has been associated with an overestimate of the estimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and this should be considered when interpreting the results.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-20 15:46:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present systematic review included a total of 115 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 26,134 participants. The included studies did not report all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol and for some comparisons only a small number of trials provided data. Overall, we detected differences between paroxetine and some comparator ADs in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. For the primary outcome, response rate, paroxetine was less effective than citalopram at endpoint. In head-to-head comparisons with newer or non-conventional ADs, we found a difference in favour of paroxetine over reboxetine and in favour of mirtazapine over paroxetine in the early phase. For the secondary outcome remission rate, we found a difference in favour of clomipramine, hypericum, mirtazapine and venlafaxine over paroxetine. For the secondary outcome acceptability, paroxetine was better than reboxetine and amitriptyline (dropouts due to side effects) and better than clomipramine, imipramine and than older ADs as a class (dropouts due to side effects and dropouts due to any cause). By contrast, paroxetine was associated with a higher rate of dropouts due to side effects than fluoxetine and tianeptine. For the secondary outcome tolerability - number of patients experiencing at least some side effects - paroxetine was better than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, and worse than hypericum.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-03-06 11:35:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>All studies included in the present review recruited participants with a formal diagnosis of depression according to operationalised diagnostic criteria such as DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria, and therefore there was considerable homogeneity in the study populations. However, we have to consider that the majority of included studies were short in duration and some analyses were underpowered to demonstrate clinically meaningful differences between treatments. There was also considerable variation in the type of control medication used in the trials, and in some cases trials did not provide data for all the outcomes specified in the protocol, thus limiting the overall completeness of evidence. Another weakness of this analysis is that different subgroups of studies provided data for each efficacy and acceptability analyses, therefore raising the possibility of outcome reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The great majority of included trials were conducted in developed countries (Europe, United States, Canada) and this issue may be of limit in the application of these results in other countries of the world. Moreover, even though we collected a considerable amount of data on efficacy and acceptability, for some comparisons only a few trials were identified. In consequence, the reader is left with the decision of whether the findings from trials carried out in developed countries with standardized methods can be translated to routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>It has long been argued that placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately demonstrate the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>), however, in the present review we focused only on the comparison between paroxetine and other active treatments. The background logic that guided the development of the present review was based on two considerations. First, the efficacy of paroxetine versus placebo has already been quantified in a systematic review of published and unpublished studies (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2008</LINK>); second, the need to provide real-world evidence for patients in need of pharmacological treatment. We therefore made the choice of including only studies that compared paroxetine with another active treatment, as we reasoned that clinicians need to know how paroxetine, a reference AD agent, compares with a selection of possible comparator ADs. Although the search was thorough, and we did our very best to retrieve as much data as possible (through asking pharmaceutical companies and study authors to supply all available information and searching the GSK website to retrieve unpublished data), it is still possible that there are unpublished studies that have not been identified. Of consequence, we can assume that data from some trials are still lacking, most of which are likely to be studies with negative findings. We are also aware of the possibility that a number of further RCTs comparing paroxetine with other antidepressant drugs are currently being conducted and will be included in future updates of this review.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-20 15:31:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 'Risk of bias' assessment is crucial in influencing the results' interpretation and deserves therefore due attention. All included studies were RCTs and were very similar in design and conduct. Using high-quality research evidence is relevant to review results and to speed up the translation of research in a way that really responds to clinically relevant questions. However, the quality of RCTs is not easy to assess. Even though RCTs are the design of choice for evaluating the efficacy and acceptability of healthcare interventions (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Purgato-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purgato 2010</LINK>), the evidence upon which the findings of this review are based is relatively poor as evaluated with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and this is also reflected in our grading within the 'Summary of findings' tables. For example, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment were "unclear" in the great majority of included studies and there is evidence that non-blinded assessors in RCTs might generate biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Hr_x00f3_bjartsson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hróbjartsson 2013</LINK>). The great majority of studies included in our review were described as "double-blind", but information on the procedure followed to guarantee the blindness, and if blindness was successful was not reported in many cases. The investigators' and participants' belief about what treatment the participant is taking is a crucial issue that could influence the trIal's results. Also, the reporting of outcomes was often unclear or incomplete (for example, many RCTs did not report SDs) and the figures used to report or summarise the analyses were not immediately understandable. However, we have to consider that the scant information about allocation concealment may be a matter of reporting in the text than a real defect in the study design. The quality of evidence evaluated with the GRADE methodology (within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias) was in general, from moderate to low.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-20 15:32:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some possible limitations of this review should be noted and this means that the interpretation of results should remain tentative.</P>
<P>Although the search was thorough, it is possible that there are still unpublished studies which have not been identified. Moreover, the search date is September 2012 and there are a number of studies classified as "awaiting assessment", the eligibility of which has yet to be determined and the impact of which on the results of the review is uncertain.</P>
<P>It is important to bear in mind that the majority of the included studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry;<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
<P>To assess efficacy, we used rating scales administered by clinicians or expert assessors. Even though both the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HDRS) and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are standardized tools commonly used in antidepressant trials, they are all potentially prone to observer bias. Self-administered questionnaires were not used in the included studies, so this might represent a limitation of the methods used in the primary studies of the present review.</P>
<P>In this review we decided to consider the response rate as the primary outcome because it is one of the main goals for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The term &#8220;treatment response&#8221; describes a state of improvement in the patient&#8217;s condition of sufficient quality to result in the treating physician&#8217;s impression of at least a moderate degree of global improvement, conventionally defined as a reduction of at least 50% in depressive symptomatology. However, from a clinical point of view, the ultimate goal of the acute treatment phase of major depressive disorder may well be to achieve remission. Full remission from depression correlates with better longer-term functional recovery, lower risk of relapse and higher level of patients satisfaction than partial response (without remission). Thus, one important limitation of the included trials (and consequently of the present review) is that only a few studies reported remission rates, underpowering the analysis and undermining the possibility to find significant differences between comparisons. Moreover, outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients&#8217; and their carers&#8217; attitudes to treatment, and the patient's ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies.</P>

<P>Even though it is a matter of ongoing discussion in the scientific literature (<LINK REF="REF-Gartlehner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartlehner 2011</LINK>), there is now robust evidence that there are statistically and clinically significant differences among antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>). Results from this review suggest some differences in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability between paroxetine and certain ADs, and might contribute to developing and keeping up to date an evidence-based hierarchy of antidepressants to be used by clinicians (both specialists and general practitioners) when prescribing an antidepressant drug for moderate to severe acute major depression.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-03-28 10:52:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects we have found in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of paroxetine compared with certain antidepressants (ADs), are of generally moderate quality. Data from the present review suggest some possible differences between paroxetine and other ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain, and no definitive implications for clinical practice can be drawn. Considering the methodological limitation of standard systematic reviews that rely only on evidence from direct comparisons and given the wide spectrum of available comparisons for the treatment of major depression, the use of the methodology of multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM) may provide a more informative and clinically useful summary of the results that can be used to guide treatment decisions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-20 15:30:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results described in this systematic review come from evidence assessed as of <I>low or moderate quality</I> according to the GRADE methodology, a tool providing outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison and the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined. Moreover, in many cases studies were financially supported by pharmaceutical industries. Industry-sponsored trials tend to follow a standard design which involves short-term, double-blind, parallel-group studies of patients with acute episodes or exacerbations of chronic illness. Often, patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidity or taking concomitant medication are excluded. Moreover, it is known that economic support by drug manufacturers can strongly influence progress of research and its results. Consequently, there is a risk that these studies do not provide sufficient and adequate information to clinicians in real-world settings. Studies should be conducted following high methodological standards and with the primary intent of providing clinicians with useful practical data regarding the comparative effectiveness of marketed medications, and consider rating scales but also pragmatic outcome measures (for example hospitalisations, return to work, social functioning and so on). If not, there is a risk that research will be guided only by economic interests instead of being based on clinical grounds.</P>
<P>Moreover, when dealing with summary statistics, the quality and the completeness of information is important. Meta-analyses of poor quality studies may be seriously misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>), because the bias associated with defects in the conduct of primary studies (randomised trials) can seriously affect the overall estimate of intervention. Systematic review authors (not only within The Cochrane Collaboration) should routinely assess the risk of bias in the results of trials, and should report meta-analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Male and female patients (18&#8211;65 years) meeting diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were eligible (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).

A total score of &gt;20 on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was required at screening and baseline. Patients were excluded if they had a clinically predominant axis I disorder other than MDD. Other key exclusion criteria were: history of unresponsiveness to either paroxetine or venlafaxine or exhibited prior hypersensitivity/intolerance to either paroxetine CR or venlafaxine XR, substance abuse/dependence, prior non-response to SSRIs, suicidal/homicidal risk, concurrent psychotherapy or psychotropic pharmacotherapy, or any serious medical condition or clinically significant finding in the screening or baseline evaluation that would preclude the administration of paroxetine CR or venlafaxine XR. Patients were excluded if they required concomitant therapy with psychoactive medication or patients who have taken other psychoactive medication within the time frames specified below prior to the screening visit: antidepressants other than MAOIs or fluoxetine (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, and NSRIs), lithium and oral antipsychotics-14 days; hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and all other sedatives (including chlorpheniramine and other sedating antihistamines)-14 days; fluoxetine, MAOIs-4 weeks; depot neuroleptics-12 weeks; any CNS-active herbal preparations/supplement (e.g., St John&#8217;s wort, kava kava, etc.)F-14 days.</P>

<P>All participants were 18-70 years old and had single or recurrent moderate or severe episodes of unipolar major depression without psychotic features (DSM-IV) persisting for two weeks to a year. At screening and baseline all participants had to have a total score &#8805; 22 points on the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HDRS-17) and &#8805; 2 points for the item &#8220;depressive mood.&#8221; The diagnosis of depression was based on the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview. There were no restrictions regarding ethnic group. We excluded anyone with a decrease in total depression score of &#8805; 25% during the run-in, or with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, acute anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, depressive disorder of any type not stated above, bipolar disorder, organic mental disorder, acute post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse disorder. We also excluded patients with increased risk of suicide (defined by a score &#8805; 4 for item 10 of the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), who had previously attempted suicide, or who had not responded to more than one adequate treatment (equivalent to 150 mg/day amitriptyline for &#8805; 6 weeks) in the present episode.</P>

The LOCF analyses used the last valid assessment as an estimate for all subsequent missing values. The OC analysis did not replace missing data.

<P>
<LINK REF="FBK-01" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 1</LINK>. The protocol does not refer to dosage change in the studies that will be included, or how data on the effects of dosage change and its timing will be analysed. A major problem with paroxetine are adverse effects early during treatment and withdrawal symptoms with reduction of dosage, omission of doses, and cessation of treatment. Many RCTs have not examined these aspects, and the review must state how far they have done so.</P>
<P>Feedback 2. Because RCTs are not the main source of information about harmful effects it is important to look at other types of study, including caseseries, in reviewing the evidence. The methods of reviewing adverse effects are discussed in detail in the <I>Handbook for Reviews of Interventions</I>, Appendix 6b (which will be updated and incorporated in theforthcoming 5th edition in the body of the Handbook).</P>
<P>Feedback 3. The evidence that treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs or withdrawal from it can cause violent behaviour, albeit rarely, should also be considered in the protocol. It has been summarised by Healy, Herxheimer and Menkes. <I>Antidepressants and violence: problems at the interface of medicine and law</I>. PLoS Medicine 2006; 3(9):e372</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="FBK-01" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 1</LINK>.<BR/>We agree with Dr. Herxheimer that all issues relating to dose change are really important clinical questions. Unfortunately, most RCTs have not reported anything about that. However, in order to be able to show all available information about safety/tolerability issues, in the protocol we stated that that "in order not to miss any relatively rare or unexpected yet important side effects, in the extraction phase, we will collect all side effects data reported in literature and will discuss ways to summarize them post hoc."</P>
<P>Feedback 2.<BR/>RCTs are not the main source of information especially about side effects, because rare adverse events are unlikely to be observed in clinical trials. Furthermore, a through investigation should require the inclusion of observational evidence (cohort studies, case control and even case series). However, the main aim of the present review is to compare head-to-head paroxetine with other active treatments for depression. Thus, we decided to focus only on randomised evidence to reduce the risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Feedback 3.<BR/>This is an very interesting paper. We were aware of this issue (and other similar issues) related to tolerability profile of antidepressant drugs (and especially paroxetine). This is the reason why we reported in the protocol that we are going to collect and report in the full text review all available information "about rare or unexpected yet important side effects."</P>
