<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-09 11:18:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unhealthy sugar consumption habits are known to be associated with high rates of dental decay, and fizzy drink consumption habits associated with tooth enamel being dissolved (dental erosion). Members of the dental team routinely assess patients' diets, highlighting areas where this could be improved to reduce disease. This advice might extend to dietary issues affecting general as well as oral health. Although we know that certain dietary habits contribute to disease, whether patients take note of advice given to them and change their diet as a result, is less certain. The aim of this review was to determine whether efforts by dentists and other dental staff members are successful in changing patients' diets. We limited the review to looking at studies where diet advice was given in a dental surgery or similar place, and where the advice was given by one member of staff to an individual patient.</P>
<P>We identified five studies. Two of these were concerned with diet advice given concerning general health (one was about alcohol and one was about fruit and vegetable consumption). In both these studies there was a change to healthier behaviour following the advice.</P>
<P>We also identified three studies which attempted to change sugar consumption habits in order to reduce dental decay. However, in two out of these three studies there were also other types and forms of advice given at the same time, for example about toothbrushing. It was therefore impossible to say whether changes in diet came about because of the diet advice given or because they were subtly influenced by the other messages. For example: advice on toothbrushing might make patients more aware of their oral health resulting in changes to their diet. Most of the studies concerning sugar consumption are of relatively weak quality. The evidence for dietary advice aiming to change sugar consumption is poor. Further studies in this area should be considered.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-02-09 11:17:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 24 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 24 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 24 January 2012), CINAHL via EBSCO (1982 to 24 January 2012), PsycINFO via OVID (1967 to 24 January 2012), and Web of Science (1945 to 12 April 2011). We also undertook an electronic search of key conference proceedings (IADR and ORCA between 2000 and 13 July 2011). Reference lists of relevant articles, thesis publications (Dissertations Abstracts Online 1861 to 2011) were searched. The authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify any unpublished work.</P>

<P>Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Two of these were multi-intervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention, but where data on dietary behaviour change were reported. One of the single intervention studies was concerned with dental caries prevention. The other two concerned general health outcomes. There were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosion. In four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variables.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-09 11:19:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diet is defined as the selection of food and drink consumed by a person and generally refers to food and drinks consumed regularly or habitually, whereas nutrition is a term used in conjunction with the intake and absorption of nutrients from food and drinks. Although nutrition is recognised as being associated with some oral diseases, notably periodontal diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Touger_x002d_Decker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Touger-Decker 2003</LINK>), these indirect effects are mediated through various systems in the body. Diet on the other hand, has a direct, local effect on oral health, on the integrity of the teeth, and on the pH and composition of saliva and plaque. It plays a major aetiological role in dental caries and enamel erosion. This review is limited to interventions concerned with the direct effects of diet on oral health and is not concerned with indirect effects which are the result of nutritional factors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dental caries</HEADING>
<P>Despite marked declines in dental caries in the past 30 years, it remains a major dental public health problem in most countries. Caries risk is also something that is not just confined to childhood, since adults have been found to have caries incidence rates similar to children (<LINK REF="REF-Holst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holst 2000</LINK>). Sugars, particularly sucrose, are the most important dietary aetiological cause of dental caries. The evidence establishing sugars as an aetiological factor in dental caries is overwhelming. The foundation of this lies in the multiplicity of studies rather than in the power of one (<LINK REF="REF-Arens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arens 1999</LINK>). There is no evidence that sugars naturally incorporated in to the cellular structure of foods (intrinsic sugars) or lactose in milk or milk products (milk sugars) have adverse effects on health (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1991</LINK>). Foods rich in starch, without the addition of sugars, play a small role in coronal dental caries (<LINK REF="REF-Moynihan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moynihan 2004</LINK>). Non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES) are "sugars found in confectionery, soft drinks, table sugar, biscuits, cake, fruit juices, honey and sugars added to recipes" (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1989</LINK>). The intake of NMES beyond four times a day leads to an increased risk of dental caries (<LINK REF="REF-Moynihan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moynihan 2004</LINK>). The current dose-response relationship between caries and extrinsic sugars suggests that sugar levels above 60 g per person per day for teenagers and adults increases the rate of caries. For preschool and young children, the intakes should be proportional to those for teenagers: about 30 g per person per day for preschool children (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2001</LINK>). Controlling the intake of sugars is therefore important for caries prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Moynihan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moynihan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent studies on diet and caries have been confounded by the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes, and some have argued that with greater exposure to fluoride, the sugar consumption/caries relationship may be weaker in the modern age than previously, with fluoride raising the threshold of sugar intake at which caries progresses to cavitation (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2001</LINK>). However, a review by <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1990</LINK> concludes that within modern societies a significant relationship between sugars and caries persists despite the regular widespread use of fluoride toothpaste. He also concludes that sugars "continue to be the main threat for dental health of (1) whole populations in some developed and many developing countries, (2) for the individual in both developed and developing countries and (3) in spite of the progress made in using fluorides and improved oral hygiene". Therefore, a key strategy to further reducing levels of caries in individuals as well as for populations, is by means of reducing the frequency of sugars intakes in the diet.</P>
<P>The use of chewing gum and other xylitol-containing products have also presented another option in caries risk reduction. Chewing sugar-free gum three or more times daily for prolonged periods is thought to reduce caries incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Loveren-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Loveren 2004</LINK>). There has also been some recent research on the protective effects of certain foods on the teeth. Recent studies have shown that milk and cheese can reduce the effects of metabolic acids and help restore enamel lost during eating (<LINK REF="REF-Ahola-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahola 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kashket-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashket 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dental erosion</HEADING>
<P>Dental erosion is defined as the loss of dental hard tissue by a process that does not involve bacteria. Dietary acids are one of the most commonly cited causes of erosion (<LINK REF="REF-Moynihan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moynihan 2004</LINK>). The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of preschool children showed a relationship between the consumption of carbonated soft drinks and erosion, and the NDNS of young people reported the age-related increase in levels of dental erosion was greatest in children with the highest consumption of acidic food and drinks (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). The survey also showed that soft drinks were the largest contributing source of acidic food and drink consumption. A trend towards increased soft drink consumption has given cause for concern (<LINK REF="REF-Shenkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenkin 2003</LINK>) and has been associated with increases in the prevalence of dental erosion (<LINK REF="REF-Nunn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nunn 2003</LINK>). Changes in beverage consumption have also given rise to concern over wider health impacts. The increase in soft drink consumption has led to a decrease in dairy consumption among children and adolescents in America (<LINK REF="REF-Shenkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenkin 2003</LINK>). Replacement of milk with sugar-containing beverages affects calcium intake and overall diet quality (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2005</LINK>). It has been suggested that incorporating a dietary assessment of soft drink consumption into patient management in a dental practice setting is increasingly appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Lifestyle advice given in the primary care setting</HEADING>
<P>There is a growing emphasis on the role of general medical practitioners in giving lifestyle advice to their patients. The basis for general practice-based health promotion is that since particular lifestyle behaviours increase the risk of disease, interventions which are successful in assisting people to modify their behaviour could result in significant gains in terms of public health, with general practice settings deemed by patients as an appropriate place to receive such advice (<LINK REF="REF-Ashenden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashenden 1997</LINK>). In primary care, consultations and assessments are conducted on a one-to-one basis with advice being given which is specific to the patient's circumstances and health profile. The potential public health role of general dental practitioners in providing lifestyle advice for their patients has been recognised, and it has been suggested that dental practitioners and their teams' involvement in brief general health promotion interventions might contribute to Government targets on cancer and circulatory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 2006</LINK>). As well as smoking cessation advice, dentists are in a position to deliver dietary advice which may give health benefits beyond the prevention of oral disease. The common risk strategy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>) recognises that risk factors such as a high sugar intake contributes not only to oral disease but also, and perhaps more significantly, to diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. It is also important that any dietary messages given within the dental setting, for example relating to reduction in sugar consumption, does not give rise to other changes such as an increase in fat intake, which might have a deleterious effect on general health. There is also the potential for the involvement of dental teams in the promotion of dietary change such as increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, which has an impact on general health, but no impact on dental caries and erosion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of lifestyle change interventions</HEADING>
<P>The term 'dietary interventions' used here embraces a range of approaches from the giving of dietary advice through to undertaking dietary behaviour change interventions, and it is important that these distinctions are understood. The approaches taken in delivering lifestyle advice may range from health education (educating patients in order to change their knowledge), health advice (giving health advice as well as supporting lifestyle change) (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2000</LINK>), undertaking behavioural interventions (using behavioural strategies, specifying the changes to be made, relapse prevention, identifying barriers to change) (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2005</LINK>), and undertaking psychological interventions (using psychological theories to elicit changes) (<LINK REF="REF-Renz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renz 2007</LINK>). In relation to dietary lifestyle changes, there is also the possibility of giving dietary supplements (such as chewing sugar-free gum) to elicit change.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dietary interventions for reducing sugar and carbonated drinks and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption</HEADING>
<P>A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Lingstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingstrom 2003</LINK> which aimed at evaluating the effect of dietary changes in the prevention of dental caries found a lack of studies showing an effect of information designed to reduce sugar intake/frequency on caries increment after 2-years follow-up. It also suggested that the evidence for the use of sorbitol or xylitol in chewing gum was inconclusive. However, studies were not differentiated into types of dietary interventions, and it may be that some approaches (e.g. a behaviour change intervention) may be more effective than others. The impact of dietary changes on dental caries increment may be attenuated by confounding factors such as oral hygiene when measured across a population. Using a behavioural intervention approach, which is based on a one-to-one targeting of a high risk individual, may be more effective, and closer reflects what may happen when lifestyle advice is given in a primary care setting.</P>

<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that follow individuals for a minimum of 1 month were included. The follow-up period of 1 month was used because the primary outcome studied was a change in dietary behaviour. The unit of randomisation could be individual patients, clusters of individuals, or dental practices. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed by examining sampling techniques, randomisation procedures, allocation concealment, statistical analysis and outcome evaluation.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:03:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies included participants of any age (both child and adult) receiving dietary advice as a one-to-one intervention in a dental practice setting or in dental settings where one-to-one advice is given. A dental setting was defined as a place where dental care was the main, or at least one of the services delivered in that building. Studies based on participants recruited from populations with medical problems with systemic effects were excluded. We made this distinction in order to include disorders such as cleft lip/palate which might be considered a medical problem but where medical care considerations were limited; whereas we excluded studies such as dietary interventions for cancer patients because there were significant wider medical care considerations.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-09 11:20:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies involving a one-to-one dietary intervention with an aim to prevent dental caries or erosion or to influence general health e.g. using messages such as eat five pieces of fruit or vegetables per day, were included. Interventions included were those where dietary education or advice was given as well as interventions where there is an explicit intention to change behaviour, either by adapting habitual behaviour, removing existing behaviour or introducing new behaviours. Interventions included brief advice, skills training, provision of self help materials, counselling, lifestyle strategies, or any combination of these. Studies comparing the effects of dietary advice versus no dietary advice or dietary advice versus different dietary advice were included. Studies were included if the dietary intervention took place alongside an intervention aiming to change oral hygiene behaviour, although these multi-intervention studies were subject to subgroup analysis. Studies were excluded if they involved the giving of medication or non-dietary supplements (e.g. fluoride), unless the fluoride supplements were given as part of a multiple intervention which included attempts to change dietary behaviour. The interventions included were delivered by a dentist, dental hygienist, dental assistants or staff in any dental setting such as a dental practice, health clinic or dental hospital.</P>

<P>The primary outcomes studied were related to dietary behaviour change. The outcome measure assessed related to changes in the frequency, amount or timing of food/drink consumption, and were specific to changes in relation to sugary/low sugar foods, chewing gum, drinks and other types of food. Changes in relation to consumption of non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES) and intrinsic sugars (fruit) and other sugars, sucrose, glucose, xylitol and other intense sweeteners were recorded. The primary outcomes were based on self reported measures, or other means of recording dietary change such as diaries and methodologies using 24-hour recall.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes </HEADING>
<P>The secondary outcomes studied included both oral health and general health outcomes and depended on the aim of the intervention. If the intervention aimed for example to reduce frequency and amount of sugar consumption, dental caries outcomes were assessed. If the dietary intervention aimed at for example reducing carbonated drink consumption, tooth wear outcomes were assessed. General health outcomes were assessed where reported.<BR/>Dental caries outcomes included: caries experience (mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent or primary teeth (DMFT/dmft)), caries increment (changes in the mean DMFT/dmft scores), sound teeth/surfaces number, size and severity of white spot lesions, early carious lesions arrested or reversed, and root caries (adults only, any index).<BR/>Dental erosion outcomes included: tooth wear indices.<BR/>General health outcomes included: measures of adiposity such as Body Mass Index, waist: hip measurements, cholesterol level, blood sugar, lipids, and any other general health outcomes recorded.</P>

<P>For the studies included in this review assessment of risk of bias was conducted by two review authors using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Six domains were assessed for each included study: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding in primary outcome measurement, blinding in secondary outcome measurement, completeness of outcome data and risk of selective outcome reporting.</P>
<P>A description of the domains was tabulated for each included trial, along with a judgement of low, high or unclear risk of bias. For example, criteria for risk of bias judgements regarding allocation concealment are given below as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> version 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias - adequate concealment of the allocation (e.g. sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias - unclear about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (e.g. where the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias - inadequate allocation concealment (e.g. open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, date of birth, or case record number).</LI>

<P>A summary assessment of the risk of bias for the primary outcome (across domains) across studies was undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>The search strategy identified 5725 references. When duplicates were excluded, and titles and abstracts screened for relevance, 62 studies were identified for paper screening for study eligibility. From these, 57 studies were excluded from this review because they did not meet the criteria for inclusion. Details of the exclusion of these studies are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. One ongoing study was identified (<LINK TAG="ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Ongoing studies</LINK>). This involves a motivational interviewing intervention for overweight 12 to 14 year olds attending general dental practice. There are currently no studies awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK>). Only three of these were single-intervention studies, and only one was concerned with the prevention of dental caries (<LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>); two single intervention studies were concerned with dietary change to enhance general health (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK>). The other two studies identified were multi-intervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention, but where data on dietary behaviour change were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK>). There were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosion.</P>
<P>All three of the single intervention studies identified took place in dental teaching hospitals. <LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK> selected 20 adults on the basis of both harbouring <I>Streptococcus mutans</I> and <I>Streptococcus sobrinus</I> in saliva, and eating sugar frequently. Fourteen of the participants were students at the Dental Technical School, and six were patients at the Department of Cariology in the University of Götenburg, Sweden. Subjects in the test group (n = 12) were provided with detailed information about the sugar content of various food products, and asked to refrain from sugar-containing foods between meals as well as reducing sugar in main meals. Sugar restriction continued for 6 weeks, after which participants were asked to return to their former high-sugar diet. For the control group (n = 8), no advice on sugar restriction was given. Participants filled in, under supervision, a questionnaire consisting of 32 commonly used sugar-containing products, to calculate the number of sugar intakes per day. These data were gathered at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK> undertook a randomised controlled trial in an oral and maxillofacial surgery outpatient clinic in a Welsh dental teaching hospital aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce alcohol consumption and misuse. The participants were all male, aged between 16 and 35 years, attending for follow-up treatment required for their alcohol-related facial injury. The intervention group (n = 75) had a brief, one-session, manual-guided discussion, based on the principles of motivational interviewing. The control group (n = 76) had treatment at the outpatient clinic as usual. Baseline measures of alcohol consumption were gathered, with a follow-up after 3 and 12 months.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK> involved edentulous patients aged 45 to 80 years attending dental-student teaching clinics for replacement conventional dentures at Newcastle Dental Hospital, UK. The intervention comprised of a dietary intervention tailored to a Stage of Change (from the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change) aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable intake. The intervention group (n = 30) received two dietary counselling sessions, whereas the control (n = 28) received usual care. Baseline measures of the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed and Body Mass Index (BMI) were taken, with a follow-up 6 weeks after receiving their replacement dentures (about 10 weeks after baseline).</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK> was undertaken in the Netherlands. Participants were all adults living in a suburban Dutch village who had recently registered as a patient of the group dental practice. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) 30 minutes of instruction by a dental hygienist; 2) before the same instruction as group 1, participants were shown a 10 minute film; and 3) the control, who had no instruction at all. The instruction given by the hygienist included the relationship between sugar consumption and dental health. However, it also included information on oral hygiene, methods of improving oral hygiene, the use of fluoride, and the benefit of regular visits to the dentist. Data on dental behaviour including sugar consumption were collected using a self report questionnaire at baseline and 6-12 months later. Data were presented as means and standard deviations of sugar consumption measured on a scale 1-5, with a higher score denoting more 'positive' behaviour.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK> was the only study included involving children. All children aged 11 to 12 years in a town in Finland were screened for the presence of active initial caries lesions, and where at least one such lesion was detected, children were invited to receive a baseline dental examination and to be enrolled into a randomised controlled trial. These children were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group (n = 250) received an "individually designed patient-centred preventive programme aimed at identifying and eliminating factors which had led to the presence of active caries". The control group (n = 247) received basic prevention offered as standard in public dental clinics in the town. The individualised programme of prevention was delivered by dental hygienists trained in counselling including understanding stages of change and different strategies for counselling conversations. Counselling specifically included dietary counselling, with emphasis on identifying when during the course of the day snacking occurred, and involving emphasis on the importance of regular meals, the role of fermentable carbohydrates in the caries process, and the harmful effects of frequent snacking. Data on dietary behaviour were gathered at baseline, at follow-up after 2 and 4 years using a questionnaire that included questions on oral health-related behaviours with a 7-point Likert scale describing the frequency of the behaviour.</P>

This is a simple 5 and 20 rule: a fewer than 5% loss represents little bias and a greater than 20% loss poses serious threats to validity.

<P>In four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variables (<LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK>). In the single-intervention study by <LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>, there was a significant reduction in mean sugar intake frequency both at main meals and between meals, found at both the 3 and 6 week follow-up, when compared to baseline. At the 12 week follow-up (6 weeks after completing the intervention) there was no significant difference in mean sugar intake frequencies compared to baseline. This analysis however, does not take into account imbalances in sugar intake frequency at baseline; and a secondary analysis is not appropriate given the very limited size of the sample and design of the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK> showed that the difference in dietary behaviour (with respect to alcohol consumption) between intervention and control groups actually widened over time; with slight, but not significant differences seen at the 3 month follow-up, and significant differences detected after 12 months of follow-up. The risk ratio (RR) of drinking more than 21 units of alcohol per week was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.22) after 3 months and 0.52 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.85) after 12 months. In other words, 3 months after the intervention, the risk of drinking above a 'sensible' limit was 88% of the risk of those who had not had the intervention and this was not statistically significant; whereas after 12 months the risk of drinking above this limit was about half (52%) of the risk of those who had not had the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK> also showed a change in dietary behaviour following the intervention. The effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake was assessed by one-way analysis of co-variance adjusted for baseline intake. A significant change in the weight of fruit (but not vegetables) consumed was found in the intervention group (P &lt; 0.001), but not in the control. Significant differences in the proportion of patients (at follow-up) in the Action Stage of Change (compared to Pre-Action Stages) were reported for both the consumption of fruit and vegetables: e.g. 75% of participants were in the Action Stage in relation to fruit consumption in the intervention group, compared to only 29% of participants in the Action Stage in the control.</P>
<P>Although the authors in this study state that there was also a higher proportion of participants (at follow-up) who reported drinking fruit juice in the intervention group than in the control (P = 0.03), the statistical analysis undertaken compares change within groups, rather than comparing intervention and control at follow-up, which is more appropriate. Numbers in this analysis are small and there is an imbalance in proportions, between the intervention and control groups at baseline. Although the difference between intervention and control groups at follow-up approaches significance, it is not significant (P = 0.07). The risk rate of starting to drink fruit juice after not drinking it, was 0.23 for the intervention group, and 0.21 for the control; i.e. there was a 23% risk of starting to drink juice in the intervention group, but also a 21% risk of this in the control (risk ratio of starting to drink juice = 1.09 (95% CI 0.42 to 2.85)). There was also no statistically significant difference in the secondary outcome (BMI) when the intervention and control groups were compared (P = 0.22) in this study.</P>
<P>When the dietary data in the multi-intervention study by <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK> were analysed, only one (using xylitol products more than three times a day) of the seven dietary behaviours investigated showed that a significant change had occurred. The statistical analysis in the paper is a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of changes between baseline and follow-up which is not appropriate. However, a secondary analysis of the data comparing intervention and control groups for using xylitol more than three times a day, shows that there is a significant difference when intervention and control groups are compared at follow-up (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.68).</P>
<P>The results from the multi-intervention <LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK> study are inconclusive due to fundamental problems with study design and statistical analysis. Baseline scores for mean sugar consumption for the control group (2.89, standard deviation (SD) = 0.99) are significantly lower than in the two intervention groups (individual instruction (mean = 3.41, SD = 1.50); film plus individual instruction (mean = 3.53, SD = 1.27). The statistical analysis reports differences in the mean sugar consumption for both the intervention groups, but not for the control, compared to baseline. However, a more conventional analysis of trial data would involve comparing intervention and control, or analysing change taking into account baseline differences. Given that baseline data were only collected for half of the sample; the study design issues mean that further statistical analysis is not warranted.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-09 12:15:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Scottish-Intercollegiate-Guidelines-Network-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2007</LINK> (SIGN) guidelines relating to preventing dental caries in children at high caries risk, recommend that "given that high caries risk patients are presenting in the dental surgery, dental health education advice should be provided to individual patients at the chairside as this intervention has been shown to be beneficial". The guidelines do however acknowledge that in spite of the importance of the area, this issue is poorly researched. The results of this systematic review confirm that the evidence to support this type of intervention is weak; not because the findings of studies do not support this type of intervention, but that only a few studies have been undertaken, and many of these are poorly designed and reported.</P>
<P>It is surprising to find that in spite of a general acknowledgement that among other risk factors for dental caries, the local effect of dietary sugars plays a fundamental role in the initiation of the disease; only one study was identified in the review which involved a single intervention reducing dietary sugar intake in a dental setting. Although meeting inclusion criteria, even this study (<LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>) was a small scale experiment involving reducing sugar consumption for a period of time, with a primary focus of looking at the effects of sugar restriction on <I>Streptococcus mutans</I> and <I>Streptococcus sobrinus</I> in saliva and dental plaque. Carried out in an educational institution with a high risk of bias, this study can hardly be taken as an evidence base to support one-to-one dietary interventions focusing on the control of dietary sugars delivered at the chairside.</P>
<P>Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK>) were also included in the review which involved attempting to change behaviour in relation to dietary sugars; both of these were multi-intervention studies. Messages about improving oral hygiene were given as well as messages about reducing dietary sugars. In these multi-intervention studies, although changes in dietary behaviour were described at both baseline and follow-up, it remains a possibility that any changes in dietary behaviour may have been a consequence of a general raising of oral health awareness (as a result of both oral hygiene and dietary advice), rather than purely because dietary advice education in itself was tailored and effective.</P>
<P>The Medical Research Council document 'Framework for the development and evaluation of randomised controlled trials for complex interventions' states that "the greater the difficulty in defining what exactly are the 'active ingredients' of an intervention and how they relate to each other, the greater the likelihood that one is dealing with a complex intervention" (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>). This perspective is taken from the field of complexity science where a system is considered as a set of elements that interact together within a dynamic environment. In other words: a multiple intervention involves not just the sum of the component parts of the intervention, but there is also some interaction between these elements which is inevitable (<LINK REF="REF-Hawe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawe 2004</LINK>). Future trials of behaviour change interventions undertaken in a dental setting will need to take note of these methodological challenges.</P>
<P>Identifying the component parts of an intervention involving behaviour change is particularly problematic at present because of a lack of common nomenclature used by researchers. Terms such as 'behavioural counselling' can mean different things to different researchers and this lack of standardised definitions of the techniques used in behaviour change interventions mean that it is difficult to replicate effective interventions or identify techniques contributing to effectiveness across interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Michie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michie 2011</LINK>). Whilst motivational interviewing (used in the <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK> study) is an example of a technique where reviewers can reasonably assume that standard procedures are used which are likely to elicit the same underlying change behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-and-Michie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham and Michie 2008</LINK>); the <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK> study describes dietary counselling which was "interactive and based on mutual understanding", which is more open to interpretation. The <LINK REF="REF-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbury 2006</LINK> study reports that the intervention consisted of individual counselling sessions with an individually tailored nutrition education package. Although counsellors were trained in determining goals for the counselling, understanding Stages of Change and on different strategies for counselling conversations, the report is not specific in which techniques were applied. Definitions of 26 behaviour change techniques, with theoretical frameworks are now available, and being developed further (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-and-Michie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham and Michie 2008</LINK>), which will help to improve the reporting of future studies.</P>
<P>There is also a move to promote improvements in reporting of behaviour change interventions by extending CONSORT guidelines for these types of studies (<LINK REF="REF-WIDER-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WIDER 2011</LINK>). Editors are recommended to expect the reporting of behaviour change intervention studies to include: 1) the intervention development, 2) the change techniques used in the intervention, and 3) the causal processes targeted by the change techniques. These developments will help to improve the consistency of reporting this type of study, and the likelihood of being able to undertake evidence synthesis once more data are available.</P>
<P>The review identified a further 14 studies, all randomised controlled trials, where a one-to-one dietary intervention had been undertaken alongside interventions aiming to improve oral hygiene. In these 14 studies data on dietary behaviour change were not collected or reported and the studies were therefore excluded (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). However, in a typical dental practice setting, since dental caries is a multi-factorial disease, other issues (fluoride exposure, plaque removal) in addition to dietary advice are likely to be addressed by those delivering preventive care for patients. This raises the issue of how we might appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of this type of complex intervention.</P>
<P>In terms of summarising the findings from studies included in the review; inferences from these are limited by study design and analysis issues. In the <LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK> study, baseline data were only collected for half of the sample, and significant imbalances between intervention and control groups at baseline exist. Whilst mean sugar consumption reduced in the 'instruction only' intervention group, and not in the control. However, methodological issues mean that these results must be seen as unreliable. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK> contains fewer sources of bias and is therefore the only study involving data concerned with dietary sugars behaviour which are reasonably reliable. Data on seven different dietary behaviours were reported, with only one behaviour (using xylitol products more than three times a day) showing a significant change following the intervention.</P>
<P>Although very few studies exist which are concerned with dietary behaviour change in a dental setting, it is striking that a wide variety of outcome measures have been used. Even where the focus of the intervention is the prevention of dental caries, authors have used: number of sugar intakes per day (main meals and between meals) (<LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>); frequency of sweet consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1979</LINK>); mean sugar consumption using a 1-5 Likert scale (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK>); and frequency of using: xylitol products, eating candy, drinking soft drinks, drinking sports drinks, nibbling, eating warm meals and eating healthy snacks (<LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK>). Combinations of sugar amount/frequency and food adhesiveness are known to be better predictors of caries risk than the amount of sugar (<LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2010</LINK>), and so future studies may need to use a greater range and complexity of dietary behaviour outcome measures. Appropriate handling of the statistical analysis of multiple measures will however be necessary.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK> study was the only study of the five, where a subsequent publication reported cost effectiveness. An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated which expresses the cost associated with each extra unit of outcome (the mean of the individual differences in DMFS scores between baseline and follow-up). The ICER was EUR 34.07 per averted DMF surface. However, these calculations were based on the costs of the dietary intervention undertaken alongside counselling on toothbrushing practices, and the contribution of each cannot be assessed separately. The analysis did show that total costs decreased year after year, and for the last 2 years the experimental regimen was less expensive than the standard dental care. The authors suggest that the experimental regimen would probably have been more cost-effective than standard dental care if the follow-up period had been longer, the regimen less comprehensive, and/or if dental nurses had been used to deliver the intervention rather than dental hygienists. The relative contribution of dietary counselling to overall prevention of disease in a multi-intervention package of prevention therefore becomes relevant. What would have been the size of the health outcome had only a dietary intervention been undertaken, or would removing this component from the intervention have made the regimen more cost-effective? These are important questions for future studies.</P>
<P>There is some evidence that interventions aiming to change dietary behaviour in a dental setting can be effective. Two studies were identified which involved interventions to change dietary behaviour focused on improving general, rather than oral health. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK> showed that a brief, one session intervention based on the principles of motivational interviewing was effective in reducing alcohol consumption in young adult males; and <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK> showed that an intervention involving dietary counselling tailored to a Stage of Change was effective at increasing fruit and vegetable consumption of edentulous patients. There is therefore some basis for using one-to-one interventions in the dental setting as an effective means of changing dietary behaviour, to the benefit of patients. It should however be noted that both the <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK> studies were undertaken in a dental hospital environment, and so more studies are needed to look whether this type of intervention is effective in a dental practice setting.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria used stipulated that participants were to be followed for a minimum of 1 month. Two of the five included studies had a follow-up of less than 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogstraten-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogstraten 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 2006</LINK>). The other three studies had a follow-up period of over a year (<LINK REF="STD-Wennerholm-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wennerholm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hausen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hausen 2007</LINK>). This raises the question as to whether any of the dietary changes observed in the shorter period of follow-up, were sustainable longer term, sufficient to bring about general and oral health benefits. Whilst relatively few such interventions have been subjected to long-term analysis of effectiveness, it is possible that intervention effects may diminish over time once the stimulus for change is gone, and once competing demands and inertia divert patients' efforts elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Stange-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stange 2003</LINK>). Likewise, there may be a difference seen between effects observed in the initial implementation of a programme in a setting such as a dental practice, and results observed once the intervention is institutionalised some time later. Future studies should ideally plan for a longer period of follow-up, to assess the impact of any dilution of the intervention over time.</P>
<P>Whilst there are relatively few studies, the dental setting does appear to have some potential in delivering effective preventive interventions aimed at improving general health. There are other opportunities such as the giving of diet advice to address diabetes, obesity and cardio-vascular disease which have yet to be explored. Given that dentists appear willing to undertake chairside screening for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2010</LINK>); and that similar dietary factors are implicated in both CVD and oral disease, chairside dietary counselling as part of CVD risk-reduction strategies is suggested to be an appropriate task for the dental team (<LINK REF="REF-Touger_x002d_Decker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Touger-Decker 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is tentative evidence that one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in a dental setting aimed at promoting general rather than oral health, are effective at changing dietary behaviour. There is little evidence that one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in a dental setting aimed at preventing dental caries are effective, but mainly because very few studies have been undertaken in this area, and where studies have been undertaken, most have significant methodological weaknesses. There are no studies of one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in the dental setting which are aimed at preventing tooth erosion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-09 12:17:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is needed which is undertaken in a dental practice setting rather than a dental school setting to support the evidence that the delivery of one-to-one dietary interventions aimed at promoting general health are effective in the dental setting. There is also a need for studies related to changing dietary behaviour relevant to the prevention of tooth erosion, and more methodologically rigorous research which examines the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in the dental setting concerned with changing dietary sugar behaviour to prevent dental caries.</P>
<P>Researchers involved in studies in the future will need to ensure that methods of randomisation are reported and allocation concealment ensured, that blinding is in place, and that there is a determination of sample size at the design stage. Statistical analysis needs to be focused on the comparison between the intervention and control groups, rather than looking at changes between baseline and follow-up for the intervention and control groups separately.</P>
<P>Identification of appropriate dietary outcome measures will be a challenge; for it will probably require more than one type of measure to be used (e.g. frequency as well as amount of sugar consumption, and possibly food adhesiveness where dietary interventions to prevent dental caries are concerned). Confounding variables such as fluoride exposure and oral hygiene should be controlled where possible. Where complex interventions are involved, the possibility of a synergistic effect of various components working together should be examined.</P>
