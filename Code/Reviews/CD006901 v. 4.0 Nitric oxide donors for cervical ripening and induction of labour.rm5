<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-21 10:26:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially in the third trimester because of safety concerns for the mother or her baby. Most commonly used cervical ripening or induction agents also cause uterine activity or contraction, which requires close monitoring of mother and baby within a hospital environment.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Nitric oxide (NO) donor agents such as isosorbide mononitrate, Isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside are thought to bring on ripening of the cervix (neck of the womb) without producing contractions and could be used in an outpatient setting. There are increasing data to support their use for this purpose.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence on 15th August 2016 and identified a further 13 studies. The review now includes a total of 23 studies involving 4777 women. The five main primary outcomes (after the administration of NO donors) included: vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours; uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the fetal heart rate; caesarean section; serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death; and serious maternal morbidity or death. The evidence for the five primary outcomes was mainly found to be of low quality. There was no evidence of a difference for any of the primary outcomes analysed. There was evidence from four trials to suggest that NO donors were superior to placebo in bringing on ripening of the cervix. Women who received NO donors were also more likely to experience side effects such as headache, nausea or vomiting.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>NO donor leads to little or no difference on the majority of labour process and delivery outcomes. However, there was some evidence to suggest that it probably helps in causing the cervix to be more favourable at 12 to 24 hours after administration. Additional studies are needed to see the true impact of NO donors in bringing on induction of labour and its effect on caesarean section rates.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-02 10:08:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 23 trials (including a total of 4777 women). Included studies compared NO donors with placebo, vaginal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), intracervical PGE2, vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foley catheter. The majority of the included studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Nitric oxide versus placebo </B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference for any of the primary outcomes analysed: vaginal delivery not achieved in 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.15; one trial, 238 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.62; two trials, 300 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), caesarean section (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11; nine trials, 2624 women; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) or serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death (average RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.08 to 33.26; two trials, 1712 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There were no instances of serious maternal morbidity or death (one study reported this outcome).</P>
<P>There was a reduction in an unfavourable cervix at 12 to 24 hours in women treated with NO donors (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90; four trials, 762 women), and this difference was observed in both subgroups of standard release and slow release formulation. Women who received NO donors were less likely to experience uterine hyperstimulation without FHR rate changes (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.80; one trial, 200 women), and more likely to experience side effects, including nausea, headache and vomiting.</P>
<P>
<B>Nitric oxide donors versus vaginal prostaglandins </B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of any difference between groups for uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes or caesarean section (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21; three trials, 571 women). Serious neonatal morbidity and serious maternal morbidity were not reported. There were fewer women in the NO donor group who did not achieve a vaginal delivery within 24 hours (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86; one trial, 400 primiparae women).</P>
<P>
<B>Nitric oxide donors versus intracervical prostaglandins </B>
</P>
<P>One study reported a reduction in the number of women who had not achieved a vaginal delivery within 24 hours with NO donors (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86; one trial, 400 women). This result should be interpreted with caution as the information was extracted from an abstract only and a full report of the study is awaited. No differences were observed between groups for uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.74; one trial, 42 women) or serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.74; one trial, 42 women). Fewer women in the NO donor group underwent a caesarean section in comparison to women who received intracervical prostaglandins (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; two trials, 442 women). No study reported on the outcome serious maternal morbidity or death.</P>
<P>
<B>Nitric oxide donors versus vaginal misoprostol </B>
</P>
<P>There was a reduction in the rate of uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes with NO donors (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.37; three trials, 281 women). There were no differences in caesarean section rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.21; 761 women; six trials) and no cases of serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death were reported. One study found that women in the NO donor group were more likely to not deliver within 24 hours (RR 5.33, 95% CI 1.62 to 17.55; one trial, 150 women). Serious maternal morbidity or death was not reported.</P>
<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, there was an increase in cervix unchanged/unfavourable with NO (RR 3.43, 95% CI 2.07 to 5.66; two trials, 151 women) and an increase in the need for oxytocin augmentation with NO induction (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.45; 7 trials; 767 women), although there was evidence of significant heterogeneity which could not be fully explained. Uterine hyperstimulation without FHR was lower in the NO group, as was meconium-stained liquor, Apgar score less than seven at five minutes and analgesia requirements.</P>
<P>
<B>Nitric oxide donors versus intracervical catheter </B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence on any difference between the effects of NO and the use of a Foley catheter for induction of labour for caesarean section (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.59; one trial, 80 women). No other primary outcomes were reported. One study of 75 participants did not contribute any data to the review.</P>
<P>For all comparisons, women who received NO donors were more likely to experience side effects such as headache, nausea or vomiting.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-21 10:23:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Available data suggests that NO donors can be a useful tool in the process of induction of labour causing the cervix to be more favourable in comparison to placebo.

<P>It is often necessary to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews were combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour. The initial series of 21 reviews were developed simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hapangama-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hapangama 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howarth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howarth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jozwiak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jozwiak 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luckas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luckas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Induction of labour occurs in approximately 20% of pregnancies in the UK. The ideal agent for induction of labour would induce cervical ripening without causing uterine contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Calder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 1998</LINK>). Currently, most commonly used cervical ripening or induction agents result in uterine activity or contractions, or both. These necessitate close monitoring of mother and baby within a hospital environment. Cervical ripening without uterine contractility could occur safely in an outpatient setting and it may be expected that this would result in greater maternal satisfaction and lower costs.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 10:57:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be an essential mediator in the process of cervical ripening (<LINK REF="REF-Chwalisz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwalisz 1998</LINK>). There is increasing evidence that the use of NO donors (including isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside) allow cervical ripening to occur in the absence of uterine contractions and this may be performed in an outpatient environment (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullarbo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bullarbo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chanrachakul-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanrachakul 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chanrachakul-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chanrachakul 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rezk-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rezk 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2014</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-21 11:40:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The major physiological effect of NO (a free radical gas with a half-life of less than four seconds) is the relaxation of smooth muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Buhimschi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhimschi 1995</LINK>). NO itself is endogenously supplied from L-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1977</LINK>), which has been identified as being present in the human cervix (<LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1995</LINK>). This NO product reacts with soluble guanylate cyclase, the product of which raises the concentration of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP causes the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains within the smooth muscle structure leading to its relaxation. Significantly, the cervix is largely composed of connective tissue, including smooth muscle. Previous studies have confirmed that this smooth muscle component of the cervix has a functional role in cervical ripening (<LINK REF="REF-Bryman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryman 1986</LINK>). Several animal experiments have independently come to the conclusion that NO is an important mediator in the cervical ripening process (<LINK REF="REF-Calder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chwalisz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwalisz 1998</LINK>). Specifically, when the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was applied to the cervixes of pregnant guinea pigs, ripening occurred in the same way as during normal labour, but significantly labour itself was not induced (<LINK REF="REF-Qing-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qing 1996</LINK>). Further to this, and in opposition to the adverse effects of prostaglandin use, NO also inhibits myometrial contraction and promotes uterine blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Ekerhord-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekerhord 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Izurni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Izurni 1993</LINK>). NO donors have even been proposed as realistic tocolytic agents in the management of preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>NO donors have successfully been used for cervical ripening, not for pre-induction ripening, but to ripen the cervix in preparation for first trimester surgical termination of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1997</LINK>), where they have been shown to have fewer adverse effects than prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is increasing focus on agents that allow safe initiation of the labour process without uterine contractions and where possible away from a hospital environment.

<P>To determine the effects of NO donors (ISMN, ISDN, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside) for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour, in comparison with placebo or no treatment or other treatments from a predefined hierarchy.</P>
<P>This review is part of a series of review focusing on induction of labour. Within all previous reviews there has been no distinction between cervical ripening and later stages of the induction process. The primary aim of all induction agents is to induce the labour not solely to produce cervical ripening. NO donors in some ways only aim to produce cervical ripening, but for the purpose of this review they have been examined alongside other similar agents and we have used similar outcomes to all the other reviews in the series.</P>

Serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths, but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All of these events are rare, and a modest change in their incidence is easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>

<LI>Vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors).</LI>
<LI>Uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes.</LI>
<LI>Caesarean section.</LI>
<LI>Serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood).</LI>
<LI>Serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</LI>

<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>
<U>) </U>in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if we considered an average treatment effect across trials was clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<P>Induction of labour with NO when compared to placebo was associated with an increase in all maternal side effects (RR 2.82, 95% CI 2.49 to 3.20; one trial, 1362 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>), nausea (average RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.05; three trials, 1782 women; I² = 55%), headache (average RR 6.59, 95% CI 3.97 to 10.95; six trials, 2085 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>), and vomiting (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.81; one trial, 1362 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity associated with the result for maternal headache, despite using a random-effects model (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.23; Chi² = 19.91, df = 5 (P = 0.001); I² = 75%). However, this was due to the results from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bollapragada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bollapragada 2009</LINK>) and the heterogeneity disappears if the results from this trial are excluded, resulting in a greater effect of NO. Despite close scrutiny of this trial, it was not possible to understand why the result for this trial would be so different to the others in this comparison.</P>
<P>When compared to placebo, the use of NO (in a standard release formulation) for induction of labour resulted in the use of less additional induction agents (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.92; five studies, 2077 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>). However, there was evidence of significant heterogeneity in this result (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.06; Chi² = 33.79, df = 4 (P &lt; 0.00001, I² = 88%). This is generated by one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rameez-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rameez 2007</LINK>). This study again is comparable to others in this group and hence it is unclear why this difference is seen.

<LI>Nitric oxide (NO) donors reduce the proportion of women with an unfavourable cervix at 12 to 24 hours when compared to placebo for induction of labour.</LI>
<LI>NO donors increase the proportion of women with an unfavourable cervix at 12 to 24 hours when compared to vaginal misoprostol.</LI>
<LI>NO donors when compared to placebo, vaginal or intracervical prostaglandins, vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foley catheter resulted in a higher rate of maternal headache when used for induction of labour.</LI>
<LI>Induction of labour with NO donors resulted in a greater proportion of women remaining undelivered at 24 to 48 hours when compared with vaginal or intracervical prostaglandins.</LI>
<LI>NO donors were associated with a reduction in the rate of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes when compared with vaginal misoprostol for induction of labour.</LI>
<LI>NO donors when compared to intracervical prostaglandins resulted in fewer women undergoing a caesarean section.</LI>
<LI>NO donors were associated with a reduction in the rate of uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes when compared with placebo or vaginal misoprostol.</LI>
<LI>There was no evidence of any difference between NO donors and Foley catheter for any of the reported outcomes, apart from an increase in headache with NO donors.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There are very limited data available to compare NO donors to any other induction agent. There is evidence to suggest that NO is more effective in causing cervical ripening in comparison to placebo however, these results needs further evaluation as this did not affect the induction to delivery interval or delivery outcomes in this comparison. Vaginal misoprostol appears to be more effective than NO donors for induction of labour.</P>
<P>In two studies, we noted the use of a complex intervention in the form of vaginal prostaglandin along with NO donor in some women (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollapragada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bollapragada 2009</LINK>). In both of these studies, the use of additional induction agents was determined by the response of the cervix following initial treatment with NO donors or placebo. If the cervix remained unfavourable (as defined by the authors), then vaginal prostaglandin was administered. If the cervix was favourable then additional vaginal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was not used. Hence for a proportion of these women a complex intervention was used. It is difficult to determine the effect of NO donor alone on the favourability of cervix in these studies.</P>
<P>It is therefore possible that the true effect of NO donors would be better evaluated through a trial comparing NO donors plus vaginal PGE2 versus other interventions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-13 14:03:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are limited data within the trials on the whole; furthermore, there are limited numbers of studies within each comparison group, making interpretation difficult. There are insufficient data to understand if we have a complete view of the effect of NO donor use in the cervical ripening.</P>
<P>As mentioned earlier in the review, NO donors work primarily to promote cervical ripening, hence the comparison to other, more traditional induction of labour agents may not be appropriate. The outcomes used to evaluate these agents look at the entire journey from the first stages of induction through to delivery. Furthermore, many of the recent studies looking at the use of NO donors have been performed within an outpatient setting where most standard ripening agents are not routinely used at present.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-13 13:02:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias was found to be low in the majority of studies for all domains. The more recent trials were found to be at the lowest risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach for the five primary outcomes for the comparison of nitric oxide donors versus placebo/no intervention (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The evidence was assessed as being low for vaginal delivery not achieved in 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes, and serious maternal morbidity. The main reason for downgrading the evidence for these outcomes was due to concerns over imprecision (few events, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals) and because most of the data were from single studies. The evidence was assessed as being of moderate quality for caesarean section and was downgraded due to limitations in design (high risk of bias for allocation concealment, selective outcome reporting and blinding).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-21 11:21:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Available data suggest that nitric oxide (NO) donors can be a useful tool in the process of induction of labour causing the cervix to be more favourable in comparison to placebo. However, further complex interventional trials are needed to study its true effect on labour process and delivery outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-21 11:27:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>More studies are required to examine how NO donors may work alongside established induction of labour protocols, especially those based in outpatient settings. There is also a need to further develop a more robust set of outcome measures which allow the efficacy of the cervical ripening phase of the induction process to be effectively evaluated.</P>
<P>An ideal study to determine the effect of NO donor would involve complex intervention. In this, women could be randomised into two groups, one receiving placebo + prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and another receiving NO donor + PGE2 regardless of the favourability of the cervix. Then the need for oxytocin, length of the labour and delivery outcomes to be assessed.</P>

<P>Randomised trial comparing ISMN to placebo. Subsequent treatment was dependent on Bishop score and if less than 6 the patients received up to 3 doses of vaginal PGE2 (3 mg) if more than 6 patients received an amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin. Hence intervention is complex and it is not possible to separate out those women who did or did not have prostaglandins in addition to oxytocin.</P>
