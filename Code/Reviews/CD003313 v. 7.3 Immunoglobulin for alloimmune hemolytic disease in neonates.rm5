These antibodies are transferred across the placenta and destroy red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia (deficiency of red cells in the unborn baby). Intrauterine (within the womb) blood transfusion is used to treat severe fetal anemia. After birth, the antibodies persist in the infant and cause hyperbilirubinemia (a raised blood level of an orange-yellow pigment (bilirubin, a waste product of a degrading red blood cell) with the risk of serious brain damage (kernicterus) and anemia. Traditional treatment of hyperbilirubinemia consists of (intensive) phototherapy (light treatment) and exchange transfusion (where the baby's blood is replaced with that of a donor; ET). Because ET is an invasive, high risk procedure, alternative treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), have been investigated. IVIg is thought to reduce the rate of hemolysis and consequently the need for ETs.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We searched the medical literature to 19 May 2017 and found nine randomized (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) or partly (quasi) randomized trials (including 658 participants) that assessed the efficiency of IVIg in infants with alloimmune HDN.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Analysis of all included studies showed a reduction in the need for and number of ETs in infants treated with IVIg combined with phototherapy compared to infants treated with phototherapy only. However, this was not confirmed in an analysis of the two placebo-controlled studies (where a pretend treatment was given). There was no difference in the need for or number of top-up transfusions.</P><P><B>Quality of evidence</B></P><P>The evidence from the studies was very low quality. However, two studies used a placebo, thereby minimizing bias and allowing blinding of the researchers assessing the response. These studies were consistent with each other and yielded moderate quality evidence (with a relatively small total number of participants involved (172) being the only reason to not regard the level of evidence from them as high) that IVIg was ineffective in preventing ET or top-up transfusions.<BR/></P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>Based on all included studies, we could make no conclusions on the benefit of IVIg in preventing ET or top-up transfusion. However, the two placebo-controlled trials provided evidence of moderate quality that IVIg was ineffective in preventing ET or top-up transfusion, and therefore routine use in alloimmune HDN should not be recommended. However, since there was some evidence that IVIg reduced hemolysis (in laboratory studies), future high-quality studies are needed to determine whether IVIg has limited role in some infants with alloimmune HDN.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-22 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-02 00:43:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Exchange transfusion and phototherapy have traditionally been used to treat jaundice and avoid the associated neurological complications.

We assessed studies for inclusion and two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We discussed any differences of opinion to reach consensus. We contacted investigators for additional or missing information. We calculated risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for categorical outcomes. We calculated mean difference (MD) for continuous variables. We used GRADE criteria to assess the risk of bias for major outcomes and to summarize the level of evidence.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-02-22 00:56:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Nine studies with 658 infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Term and preterm infants with Rh or ABO (or both) incompatibility were included. The use of exchange transfusion decreased significantly in the immunoglobulin treated group (typical RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.49; typical RD -0.22, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.16; NNTB 5). The mean number of exchange transfusions per infant was also significantly lower in the immunoglobulin treated group (MD -0.34, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.17). However, sensitivity analysis by risk of bias showed that in the only two studies in which the treatment was masked by use of a placebo and outcome assessment was blinded, the results differed; there was no difference in the need for exchange transfusions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.98) or number of exchange transfusions (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.10). Two studies assessed long-term outcomes and found no cases of kernicterus, deafness or cerebral palsy.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-22 20:30:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Although overall results show a significant reduction in the need for exchange transfusion in infants treated with IVIg, the applicability of the results is limited because of low to very low quality of evidence. Furthermore, the two studies at lowest risk of bias show no benefit of IVIg in reducing the need for and number of exchange transfusions. Based on these results, we have insufficient confidence in the effect estimate for benefit of IVIg to make even a weak recommendation for the use of IVIg for the treatment of alloimmune HDN. Further studies are needed before the use of IVIg for the treatment of alloimmune HDN can be recommended, and should include blinding of the intervention by use of a placebo as well as sufficient sample size to assess the potential for serious adverse effects.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-13 17:26:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-13 16:45:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-13 16:45:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The use of anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis in D-negative women has led to a marked decline in Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) (<LINK REF="REF-Urbaniak-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbaniak 2000</LINK>).

In addition, IVIg could allow safe treatment of some infants in less sophisticated neonatal units, or avoid delaying treatment while transferring infants for ET. Comprehensive assessment of IVIg in premature infants, particularly in the treatment of sepsis, has shown that it is safe and well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-INIS-Collaborative-Group-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">INIS Collaborative Group 2011</LINK>). It is a well-established therapy for alloimmune thrombocytopenia due to maternal and fetal human platelet antigen incompatibility (<LINK REF="REF-Winkelhorst-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winkelhorst 2017</LINK>).

Carboxyhemoglobin levels are a sensitive index of hemolysis and hence these studies suggest that immunoglobulin could decrease hemolysis. IVIg is typically formulated in 6% to 12% solutions, so at doses of 0.5 g/kg to 1 g/kg the volume administered is 4 mL/kg to 16 mL/kg. It is possible that this is a sufficient fluid bolus to reduce bilirubin levels modestly through dilution, temporarily slowing their rate of rise and allowing more time for intensive phototherapy to have effect.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-26 06:42:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002. Although results of the previous review showed a significant reduction in the need for ET in infants treated with IVIg, the applicability of the results was limited because none of three included studies was at low risk of bias. Nevertheless, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend the administration of 0.5 g/kg to 1 g/kg IVIg in alloimmune HDN if total serum bilirubin (TSB) is rising despite intensive phototherapy or if TSB level is within 34 µmol/L to 51 µmol/L (2 mg/dL to 3 mg/dL) of exchange level (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2004</LINK>). As a result of these guidelines, despite the equivocal conclusions of the previous Cochrane Review, the use of IVIg in alloimmune HDN has become widespread in many countries. However, supplies of IVIg are limited and it does present some hazards. Therefore, use of IVIg should be restricted to treatment of conditions for which it is of confirmed benefit.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-22 02:14:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>To assess the effect and complications of IVIg in newborn infants with alloimmune HDN on the need for and number of exchange transfusions. </P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-03-08 19:14:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-03-08 19:14:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-10-17 05:18:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of IVIg in the treatment of alloimmune HDN.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-03-08 19:14:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Neonates with alloimmune HDN due to either Rh (or other red cell antigens) or ABO blood group antibodies with or without any other blood group antibodies.</P></CRIT_PARTICIPANTS><CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-05 19:54:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>IVIg given for treatment of alloimmune HDN versus control (placebo or 'standard care').

Although this review update showed a significant reduction in the need for ET, most of the included studies were at high risk of bias. IVIg treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in maximum bilirubin level and duration of phototherapy when all included studies were analyzed and for most of the subgroup analyses based on type of alloimmunization, gestational age at birth, and timing and number of doses of IVIg. Duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced when analyzing all studies that reported this outcome and for almost all subgroup analyses, including the analysis of studies at low risk of bias only. Although there was some evidence that IVIg reduced hemolysis and shortened hospital stay, these results should be interpreted with considerable caution because the studies reporting these benefits were not blinded, only two studies used predefined criteria for hospital discharge, and criteria for stopping phototherapy were not reported in most studies. In addition, since the late 1980s, guidelines for phototherapy have recommended using it more promptly for infants at risk of hemolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gartner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartner 1987</LINK>). In many hospitals, the quality of phototherapy has also improved over the years. Nevertheless, the quality/intensity of phototherapy can still vary today, especially in low-resource settings and if good quality control is not applied. The incidence of late top-up transfusions is an important outcome, especially in areas where follow-up of infants is difficult or where supply of safe blood for transfusion is limited. However, as thresholds for top-up transfusions in neonates vary widely, this outcome is susceptible to bias, particularly in unblinded studies. Seven of nine studies were included in the analysis of the incidence of top-up transfusion after the first week of life (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00fc_bo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rübo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da_x011f_o_x011f_lu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Da&#287;o&#287;lu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alpay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alpay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miqdad-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miqdad 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nasseri-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nasseri 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smits_x002d_Wintjens-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smits-Wintjens 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2013</LINK>).

We identified 27 trials, of which nine trials, comprising 658 infants, fulfilled inclusion criteria for the review. The only two included studies that were placebo-controlled comprising a total of 172 infants, enrolled only infants with Rh HDN and the intervention consisted of a single dose of 0.5 g/kg to 0.75 g/kg IVIg administered within four to six hours after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Smits_x002d_Wintjens-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smits-Wintjens 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Santos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2013</LINK> included infants of 32 gestational weeks or greater and <LINK REF="STD-Smits_x002d_Wintjens-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smits-Wintjens 2011</LINK> included infants of 35 gestational weeks or greater. Criteria for phototherapy and ET were similar in both studies. Evidence from subgroup analysis of these two studies with 172 participants showed that early administration of IVIg in a single dose of 0.5 g/kg to 0.75 g/kg did not reduce ETs or had other benefits in the treatment of Rh HDN. There was no clear evidence from this review that a higher dose improved efficacy. The only randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of two doses of IVIg in Rh HDN showed that 0.5 g/kg and 1 g/kg had a similar effect on the duration of phototherapy, duration of hospitalization and ET requirements (<LINK REF="STD-Girish-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2008</LINK>). However, this study was not powered to detect a difference in the need for ET. Only two studies examined long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, which found no cases of kernicterus, deafness or cerebral palsy in a follow-up period of one year (<LINK REF="STD-Santos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2013</LINK>) and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Miqdad-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miqdad 2004</LINK>).

Based on the results of this review and because IVIg administration is not completely without risks (<LINK REF="REF-Copelan-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copelan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magny-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magny 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Figueras_x002d_Aloy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figueras-Aloy 2010</LINK>), and supplies of IVIg are limited, we do not recommend routine use of IVIg. However, since there is some evidence that it reduces hemolysis and it appears safe in infants with alloimmune HDN, it might be reasonable to consider using it in special circumstances, such as during transfer of an infant to a location that can perform an ET, where the risk of ET is considered to be much higher than usual, such as in very or extremely low birth weight infants, or in the context of a future research study.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-13 17:22:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The quality of included studies ranged from fulfilling none of the 'risk of bias' criteria to fulfilling all criteria (see 'Risk of bias' section of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Only two of nine trials fulfilled all criteria to be rated as high-quality studies. We made the decision to evaluate the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria separately for the seven studies at high risk of bias and the two studies at low risk of bias, because evaluation of the seven studies at high risk of bias as a group also demonstrated other concerns including inconsistency and indirectness. For the outcomes of use and number of ETs in the first week, the quality of evidence from the seven studies at high risk of bias was very low, whereas the evidence from the two studies at low risk of bias was moderate (downgraded only for small number of participants). For the outcome of top-up transfusions after the first week, we evaluated the level of evidence only for Rh HDN and only for the two studies at low risk of bias, because we deemed this outcome to usually be irrelevant for infants with ABO incompatibility (who are at much lower risk of late anemia) and because of incomplete reporting of data in other studies. The evidence was of very low quality. Analysis of the effect of IVIg on the need for ET in infants with ABO incompatibility included only three studies at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Alpay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alpay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miqdad-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miqdad 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nasseri-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nasseri 2006</LINK>), because other studies only enrolled infants with Rh HDN, did not use predefined criteria for top-up transfusion or did not provide sufficient detail to separate Rh- and ABO-affected infants. The quality of evidence for IVIg for ABO incompatibility was very low (GRADE analysis not shown). For several of the secondary outcomes of the review, the RR (or other relevant statistic) was not estimable for included studies (no events in either intervention or control groups), highlighting the extent to which these studies were seriously underpowered. In summary, we considered that the evidence from the two trials at low risk of bias provided a sufficient quality of evidence to guide practice.</P><P>It was unclear why placebo-controlled, high-quality trials yielded such different results. Possibilities included that when administration of IVIg was not compared with use of a placebo administered in similar dose and over similar duration, there were differences in timing of the next bilirubin measurement, meaning that in IVIg-treated infants, there was longer exposure to phototherapy before the decision about ET was made. Another possibility was that there was bias in the decision to perform an ET, influenced by knowledge of group allocation. A third possibility was that rather than a specific immunomodulatory effect, IVIg (and where used, the placebo solution) has a sufficient non-specific dilutional effect to change the rate of rise of bilirubin, altering duration of exposure to phototherapy and decision making about ET.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-02-26 04:38:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We tried to minimize bias by working with two review authors who independently assessed eligibility for inclusion of trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. However, we were aware that these parts of the review process were based on personal judgment because reviewing research is influenced by prior beliefs. In addition, one included trial was performed by two of the five review authors. Nevertheless, we attempted to review all studies in a similar way. In addition, we were unable to contact authors of all potentially eligible studies and, therefore, we could not include all available data.

We gave particular weight to the results of the only two studies that provide evidence at sufficient low risk of bias to guide routine clinical practice, and that show no reduction in the use of exchange transfusion (ET), or improvement in any other important outcomes of the review. In addition, IVIg has risks that have been identified in other contexts of treatment. Therefore, we believe routine use of IVIg for HDN should not be recommended.</P><P>The effect of IVIg plus phototherapy compared to phototherapy alone on eventual neurodevelopmental outcomes remains unknown, although there was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome between these groups in a (small) long-term follow-up study (<LINK REF="REF-van-Klink-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Klink 2016</LINK>). However, since there is some indirect evidence that IVIg reduces hemolysis and because it appears safe in neonates with alloimmune HDN (acknowledging that the combined sample size of all studies is insufficient to assess uncommon, put potentially serious adverse effects), it may have a limited role in special circumstances, such as where ET is impossible, or is considered particularly high risk. Nevertheless, undertaking preparations for ET, including ensuring earliest possible use of intensive phototherapy, and birth at or transfer to a center that can perform ET, would seem to be strongly indicated in high-risk infants, and should not be abandoned in the expectation that IVIg will be efficacious.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-13 17:26:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Future research into the role of IVIg in the early treatment of alloimmune HDN may be warranted, especially for infants for whom ET carries particularly high risks. Such a trial should examine the safety and efficacy of IVIg by recording both short-term outcomes such as the need for transfusion therapy and the incidence of adverse events and also long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Both ETs and (late) top-up transfusions should be recorded because reduction of ETs can increase the number of top-up transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Rath-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rath 2010</LINK>). Consideration should also be given to including additional measures to assess the severity of hemolysis such as carboxyhemoglobin or end tidal carbon monoxide. Based on evidence from the two placebo-controlled trials at low risk of all forms of bias, the conclusion of the review authors is that IVIg is of very limited usefulness in Rh HDN. However, neither of these placebo-controlled studies enrolled infants with severe established jaundice due to ABO incompatibility. In contrast to Rh incompatibility, ABO incompatibility mainly results in hyperbilirubinemia without significant anemia. This is primarily due to the relatively few group A and B antigenic sites on neonatal red blood cells (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, infants with ABO-mediated hemolysis often present for neonatal care when they already have severe jaundice. Due to these differences between Rh and ABO incompatibility it is conceivable that IVIg has a different effect in anti-A or anti-B-mediated jaundice. Due to the relative rarity of severe jaundice caused by ABO incompatibility in many countries and the fact that this condition almost always resolves with phototherapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bhat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhat 2012</LINK>), exploring the use of IVIg to treat established jaundice would require a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Based on the discordance of results in this review between trials that were conducted with and without careful blinding of the intervention using a placebo, we recommend that any future trials should either use a placebo or a robust alternative method for blinding of treatment and outcome assessment. Future trials should be well designed and give priority to establishing guidelines for the "conventional" management of alloimmune HDN, focusing on the criteria for performing both top-up and ETs and on the role of intensive phototherapy.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-02-22 05:17:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Gary Alcock for writing the original protocol and review.</P><P>Gürbey Ocak for his help in translating the Turkish article.</P><P>David Corpman for translating two Chinese articles and Wenjun Nie for translating the third.</P><P>Jan Schoones for his help in making and performing the literature search.</P><P>Lizelle Weber for contributions to the literature search.</P><P>Vivianne Smits-Wintjens for advice to Mirjam Rath on initial assessment of risk of bias in included and excluded studies</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-02-26 06:23:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>CZ: none.</P><P>MR: none.</P><P>EL: none.</P><P>MH: none.</P><P>HL: none.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-25 04:00:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Mirjam Rath wrote the protocol for the review.

We updated the background to include contemporary literature. The eligible participants were further specified (from "Neonates with isoimmune hemolytic disease" to "Neonates with alloimmune HDN due to either Rh or ABO blood group antibodies with or without any other blood group antibodies." The primary and secondary outcomes were adjusted to more relevant outcomes in the current era. Previously, the subgroup analysis for timing of IVIg treatment was divided in 'prophylactic use' and 'treatment of established jaundice'. For the current review, this was changed to within 12 hours of life or later. Due to the lack of definitions and the possibility of incomplete reporting in regard to adverse events, the adverse events of individual trials were stated in the current review, rather than combined raw outcomes of all included studies.</P><P>A sensitivity analysis for risk of performance or detection bias (or both) was added. Furthermore, we incorporated the GRADE criteria and added a 'Summary of findings' table for the most important outcomes.</P></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES/></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-03-14 22:22:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yolanda Brosseau">
