<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with dementia gradually develop difficulties with memory, thinking, language and daily activities. Dementia is often associated with emotional and behavioural problems and may lead to a reduction in a person's quality of life. In the later stages of dementia it may be difficult for people to communicate with words, but even when they can no longer speak they may still be able to hum or play along with music. Therapy involving music may therefore be especially suitable for people with dementia. Music therapists are specially qualified to work with individuals or groups of people, using music to try to help meet their physical, psychological and social needs. Other professionals may also be trained to provide similar treatments.</P>
<P>
<B>Purpose of this review</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to see if we could find evidence that treatments based on music improve the emotional well-being and quality of life of people with dementia. We were also interested in evidence about their effects on emotional, behavioural, social or cognitive (e.g. thinking and remembering) problems in people with dementia.</P>
<P>
<B>What we did</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for trials in which people with dementia were randomly allocated to a music-based treatment or to a comparison group, and in which any of the outcomes we were interested in were measured. The comparison groups might have had no special treatment, or might have been offered a different activity. The trials had to have offered at least five sessions of treatment because we thought fewer sessions than this were unlikely to have much effect. If we judged that the trials were similar enough, then we combined their results in order to estimate the effect of the treatment as accurately as possible.</P>
<P>
<B>What we found</B>
</P>
<P>We found seventeen trials to include in the review and we were able to combine results for at least some outcomes from 620 people. All of the people in the trials were living in care homes. People with all severities of dementia were included. Some trials compared music-based treatments with usual care, and some compared it with other activities, such as cooking or painting. The quality of the trials and how well they were reported varied, and this affected our confidence in the results. First, we looked at outcomes immediately after a course of therapy ended. From our results, we could be moderately confident that music-based treatments improve symptoms of depression, but do not help with agitated or aggressive behaviour. We were less confident in our results on emotional well-being including quality of life, overall behavioural problems, and cognition, but music-based treatments may have little or no effect on these outcomes. We had very little confidence in our results on anxiety and social interaction. Some studies also looked to see whether there were any lasting effects four weeks or more after treatment ended. However, there were few data and we were very uncertain about the results. Further trials are likely to have a significant impact on what we know about the effects of music-based treatments for people with dementia, and so continuing research is important.</P>

<P>Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music-based interventions as a treatment.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-04-07 13:36:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour, and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-04-07 13:37:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A>, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 14 April 2010 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were also carried out on 3 July 2015 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, psycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources. On 12 April 2016, we searched the major databases for new studies for future evaluation.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-03-31 13:33:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-04-10 22:41:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random-effects models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-07 14:21:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 17 studies. Sixteen studies with a total of 620 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, but all were resident in institutions. Five studies delivered an individual music intervention; in the others, the intervention was delivered to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias. At the end of treatment, we found low-quality evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect on emotional well-being and quality of life (standardized mean difference, SMD 0.32, 95% CI &#8722;0.08 to 0.71; 6 studies, 181 participants), overall behaviour problems (SMD &#8722;0.20, 95% CI &#8722;0.56 to 0.17; 6 studies, 209 participants) and cognition (SMD 0.21, 95% CI &#8722;0.04 to 0.45; 6 studies, 257 participants). We found moderate-quality evidence that they reduce depressive symptoms (SMD &#8722;0.28, 95% CI &#8722;0.48 to &#8722;0.07; 9 studies, 376 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD &#8722;0.08, 95% CI &#8722;0.29 to 0.14; 12 studies, 515 participants). The quality of the evidence on anxiety and social behaviour was very low, so effects were very uncertain. The evidence for all long-term outcomes was also of very low quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-07 13:59:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Providing people with dementia with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms but has little or no effect on agitation or aggression. There may also be little or no effect on emotional well-being or quality of life, overall behavioural problems and cognition. We are uncertain about effects on anxiety or social behaviour, and about any long-term effects. Future studies should employ larger sample sizes, and include all important outcomes, in particular 'positive' outcomes such as emotional well-being and social outcomes. Future studies should also examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-21 15:03:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-04-10 23:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterised by progressive decline in cognitive functions. Dementia of the Alzheimer's type is the most common form of dementia, followed by vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia (<LINK REF="REF-ADI-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADI 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dementia is a collective name for progressive degenerative brain syndromes which affect memory, thinking, behaviour and emotion (<LINK REF="REF-ADI-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADI 2015</LINK>). Symptoms may include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>loss of memory;</LI>
<LI>difficulty in finding the right words or understanding what people are saying;</LI>
<LI>difficulty in performing previously routine tasks;</LI>
<LI>personality and mood changes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease International estimates that worldwide currently 46.8 million people are suffering from dementia; and that this figure will increase to 74.7 million by 2030 and to 131.5 million people by 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-ADI-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADI 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research is pursuing a variety of promising findings related to describing the causes of dementia and for the treatment of dementia. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited ability to treat many of the syndrome's features. Little research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments.</P>
<P>As dementia is due to damage to the brain, one approach is to limit the extent and rate of progression of the pathological processes producing this damage. At present the scope of this approach is limited and an equally important approach is to help people with dementia and their caregivers to cope with the syndrome's social and psychological manifestations. As well as trying to slow cognitive deterioration, care should aim to stimulate abilities, improve quality of life, and reduce problematic behaviours associated with dementia. The therapeutic use of music might achieve these aims.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-04-21 10:03:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many treatments of dementia depend on the client's ability to communicate verbally. When the ability to speak or understand language has been lost, music might offer alternative opportunities for communication. People who cannot speak anymore may still be able to hum or play along with music.</P>
<P>Music therapy is defined by the World Federation of Music Therapy (WFMT) as "the professional use of music and its elements as an intervention in medical, educational, and everyday environments with individuals, groups, families, or communities who seek to optimize their quality of life and improve their physical, social, communicative, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health and wellbeing". Research, practice, education, and clinical training in music therapy are based on professional standards according to cultural, social, and political contexts (<A HREF="http://www.wfmt.info/wfmt-new-home/about-wfmt/">WFMT, 2011</A>). The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) defines music therapy as "the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program" (<A HREF="http://www.musictherapy.org/about/musictherapy/">AMTA</A>). It describes assessment of the client, interventions ("including creating, singing, moving to, and/or listening to music"), benefits and research, and explains that music therapy is used "within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals". We reviewed music-based interventions, which may share these therapeutic goals even if not provided by an accredited music therapist.</P>
<P>Two main types of music therapy can be distinguished &#8212; receptive (or passive) and active music therapy &#8212; and these are often combined (<LINK REF="REF-Guetin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guetin 2013</LINK>). Receptive music therapy consists of listening to music by the therapist who sings, plays or selects recorded music for the recipients. In active music therapy, recipients are actively involved in the music-making, by playing on small instruments for instance. The participants may be encouraged to participate in musical improvisation with instruments or voice, with dance, movement activities or singing.</P>
<P>Music may also be used in ways which are less obviously therapy or therapeutic, for example playing music during other activities such as meals or baths, or during physiotherapy or movement, or as part of an arts programme or other psychosocial interventions. 'Music as therapy' includes more narrowly defined music therapy provided by "a formally credentialed music major with a therapeutic emphasis" (<LINK REF="REF-Ing_x002d_Randolph-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing-Randolph 2015</LINK>). In order to benefit people with dementia, those providing music-based interventions with a therapeutic goal may need to draw on the skills of both musicians and therapists to select and apply musical parameters adequately, tailored to a recipient's individual needs and goals.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-21 14:44:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Music-based therapeutic interventions, including interventions provided by a certified music therapist, mostly consist of singing, listening, improvising or playing along on musical instruments. Music and singing may stimulate hemispheric specialization. Clinical observations indicate that singing critically depends upon right-hemisphere structures. By contrast, people suffering from aphasia due to left-hemisphere lesions often show strikingly preserved vocal music capabilities. Singing may be exploited to facilitate speech reconstruction when suffering from aphasia (<LINK REF="REF-Riecker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riecker 2000</LINK>). Singing can further help the development of articulation, rhythm, and breath control. Singing in a group setting can improve social skills and foster a greater awareness of others. For those with dementia, singing may encourage reminiscence and discussions of the past, while reducing anxiety and fear. For individuals with compromised breathing, singing can improve oxygen saturation rates. For individuals who have difficulty speaking following a stroke, music may stimulate the language centres in the brain promoting the ability to sing. In sum, singing may improve a range of physical and psychosocial parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Clift-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clift 2016</LINK>). Playing instruments may improve gross and fine motor coordination in individuals with motor impairments or neurological trauma related to a stroke, head injury or a disease process (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2017</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.wfmt.info/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FAQ-Research_WFMT-20101.pdf">WFMT, 2010</A>).<BR/>

<P>Whereas cognitive functions decline during disease progression, receptivity to music may remain until the late phases of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Adridge-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adridge 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baird-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cowles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowles 2003</LINK> ). Even in the latest stage of the disease, they may remain responsive to music where other stimuli may no longer evoke a reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Norberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norberg 1986</LINK>).This may be related to musical memory regions in the brain being relatively spared in Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2015</LINK>). Possibly, the fundamentals of language are musical, and precede lexical functions in language development (<LINK REF="REF-Adridge-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adridge 1996</LINK>). Listening to music itself may decrease stress hormones such as cortisol; and helps patients to cope with, for instance, pre-operative stress (<LINK REF="REF-Spintge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spintge 2000</LINK>). Music therapy can bring relaxation and has a positive effect on enhancing communication and emotional well-being (<LINK REF="STD-Brotons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brotons 2000</LINK>). Music therapy enables the recall of life experiences and the experience of emotions. Many important life events are accompanied by music; most of the time these 'musical memories' are stored for a longer time than the ones from the same period that were not accompanied by music (<LINK REF="REF-Broersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broersen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baird-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2009</LINK>). If words are not recognized any longer, familiar music may provide a sense of safety and well-being, which in turn may decrease anxiety.Musical rhythm may help people with Alzheimer's disease to organize time and space. Patients are able to experience group contact through musical communication with other participants, without having to speak. Owing to its non-verbal qualities, music-based interventions might help people with dementia at all levels of severity to cope with the effects of their illness.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-04-21 15:03:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we examine current research literature to assess whether music-based therapeutic interventions, including music therapy, are an efficacious approach to the treatment of emotional, behavioural, social, and cognitive problems in people with dementia. We also investigate whether, in the absence of specific problems, these interventions have an effect on emotional well-being, including quality of life, or social behaviour in people with dementia. Quality of life is often an appropriate goal of care for people with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-ADI-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADI 2016</LINK>), and it is important to assess evidence as to whether music-based therapeutic intervention can contribute to quality of life or related outcomes.</P>

<P>We included people who were formally diagnosed as having any type of dementia according to DSM-IV or DSM-5, ICD-10 or other accepted diagnostic criteria. In order to be relevant to clinical practice, we also accepted a physician's diagnosis of dementia if no data on formal criteria such as DSM-IV, DSM-5 or comparable instruments were available. We included people living in diverse settings including in the community, hospitals or nursing homes and all severities of dementia.

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 16:03:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any music-based interventions, either active or receptive, delivered to individuals or groups. We required a minimum of five sessions in order to ensure that a therapeutic intervention could have taken place. We defined therapeutic music-based interventions as: therapy provided by a qualified music therapist, or interventions based on a therapeutic relationship and meeting at least two of the following criteria/indicators: (a) therapeutic objective which may include communication, relationships, learning, expression, mobilisation and other relevant therapeutic objectives; (b) music matches individual preferences; (c) active participation of the people with dementia using musical instruments or singing; (d) participants had a clinical indication for the intervention or were referred for the intervention by a clinician. We also required music to be a main element of the intervention (e.g. not merely moving with use of music). Simple participation in a choir would not meet our definition of a therapeutic intervention.</P>
<P>The music-based interventions could be compared with any other type of therapy or no therapy. Control groups could not receive any music-based therapeutic intervention (even if fewer sessions than the intervention group).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2017-04-11 00:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<UL>
<LI>Emotional well-being, including quality of life and positive affect. Facial expressions (in the absence of interaction with the observer) may also indicate emotional well-being.</LI>
<LI>Mood disturbance or negative affect: depression (depressive symptoms) or anxiety.</LI>
<LI>Behavioural problems: agitation and/or aggression, overall behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric symptoms. (We combined agitation and aggression outcomes consistent with the International Psychogeriatric Association consensus definition of agitation requiring presence of one of "excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression" (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2015</LINK>)).</LI>
<LI>Social behaviour, such as (verbal) interaction.</LI>
<LI>Cognition.</LI>
<LI>Any other adverse effects.</LI>

<P>For these outcomes, we accepted all assessment tools used in the primary studies. Outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment (a minimum of five sessions), irrespective of the duration and number of sessions in excess of four. If there was evidence of no different effect over time, then reported outcomes could include earlier assessments. We also looked for outcomes a minimum of four weeks after the treatment ended in order to assess long-term effects.</P>

<P>The protocol did not prioritise outcomes. We prioritised the outcomes related to emotions (emotional well-being including quality of life, and mood disturbance or negative affect) as being of critical importance because these outcomes (e.g. depression) are closely related to quality of life of people with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Banerjee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banerjee 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beerens-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beerens 2014</LINK>). Depression and anxiety are also prevalent and rather persistent during the course of the dementia (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Linde-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Linde 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2016</LINK>). We further prioritised behavioural problems because these affect relationships and caregiver burden (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Linde-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Linde 2012</LINK>); and some may also be indicators of distress.</P>

They looked at the following elements of study quality: selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other potential threats to validity.

<P>Selective outcome reporting is covered by the risk of bias assessment, and for this we searched the articles about included studies and related articles for references to study protocols and trial registrations. If available, we compared with outcomes and prioritisation of outcomes in the article.

To detect possible publication bias, we examined funnel plots for outcomes with at least 10 studies available.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-04-11 00:23:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies about all eligible interventions in similar groups of people in different stages of dementia, and we pooled the results of studies that examined effects on the same seven outcomes. We discriminated between effects at the end of treatment, and long-term effects (a minimum of four weeks after treatment ended). In case of clinically homogeneous studies, results would have been combined using a fixed-effect model. In case of statistical heterogeneity (assessed by visual inspection of the forest plots) and the availability of at least five studies, a random-effects model was used.</P>
<P>We were interested in both usual care and other activity-control interventions because usual practice with regard to activities offered is variable, and the question as to whether music-based therapeutic interventions should be introduced and the question as to whether they are superior to other activities are both relevant in practice. We presented data by type of control intervention: usual care or other activities. A control group with other activities controls for increased social contact and stimulation. However, it is unclear whether this increases or decreases contrast with the music-based intervention group for different outcomes (e.g. agitation, anxiety). We therefore analysed effects against all control groups as planned in the protocol, but for purposes of possible hypothesis generation we present forest plots by subgroup.</P>

<P>Post hoc, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses because there are different possible criteria as to what constitutes music therapy, and because funding related to music therapy potentially involves an intellectual conflict of interest. We first reran all analyses on end-of-treatment effects with studies in which the intervention was probably or definitely (when mentioned explicitly) delivered by a professional music therapist only. Second, we restricted these analyses to studies definitely delivered by a music therapist. Third, we restricted the analyses to studies definitely delivered by a music therapist and with no potential conflict of interest related to funding or no reported funding source.</P>

<P>We used GRADE methods to rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate or low) behind each effect estimate in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). This rating refers to our level of confidence that the estimate reflects the true effect, taking account of risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency between studies, imprecision in the effect estimate, indirectness in addressing our review question and the risk of publication bias. We produced 'Summary of findings' tables for end-of-treatment and long-term outcome comparisons to show the effect estimate and the quantity and quality of the supporting evidence for outcomes for which more studies were available. The summary of findings was generated with Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) data imported into the GradePro Guideline Development Tool (2015).</P>

Whereas the two oldest studies were from the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998</LINK>), the studies published after 1998 were from a variety of other regions and countries: 11 studies conducted in seven countries in Europe (Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Iceland, including also one study performed in two countries, Denmark and Norway; <LINK REF="STD-Ridder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ridder 2013</LINK>), three studies from two countries in Asia (Taiwan and Japan), and one study from Australia. The studies were all performed in institutional settings of nursing homes, residential homes and geriatric hospital wards. Dementia severity varied.</P>
<P>The interventions were active (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>); receptive (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gu_x00e9_tin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guétin 2009</LINK>); or a mixture of the two forms (the other 10 studies). <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> describes the music-based therapeutic intervention and other activities of all studies. Music included live or recorded music that met preferences of the group or individual. The active forms often combined playing of instruments and singing activities, and some also combined with movement such as clapping hands and dance. Sessions varied in duration between half an hour and two hours. The total number of sessions ranged from six (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>) to 156 (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>), with a median total number of 12 sessions until the end of treatment assessment. The frequency ranged between one session per week (<LINK REF="STD-Gu_x00e9_tin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guétin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 2013</LINK>) and six sessions per week (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>), with a median and more typical number (mode) of two sessions per week (two per week was employed in 10 studies). These figures probably reflect number of sessions offered, as the number of attended session may be lower. There are few reports about implementation fidelity including adherence and dose received, but <LINK REF="STD-Ridder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ridder 2013</LINK> reports that a minimum of 12 sessions were offered, but the participants received 10 sessions on average.</P>
<P>In seven of the studies, we could be sure from the report that the interventions had been delivered by an accredited music therapist (<LINK REF="STD-Svansdottir-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Svansdottir 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ceccato-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccato 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ridder 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vink-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vink 2013</LINK>). In four studies, it was unclear whether a music therapist was involved (no profession reported in the older studies, <LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993 </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998</LINK>; probably delivered by trained music therapists but it was not stated explicitly in <LINK REF="STD-Gu_x00e9_tin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guétin 2009</LINK>; and delivered by musicians trained in the delivery of sessions and in working with older people with dementia but unclear if these were formally trained music therapists in <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>). In the other six studies, the intervention was not delivered by a music therapist (psychologist and other supervisor(s) with no training in music therapy, <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2014</LINK>; trained research assistants, <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2012</LINK>; music facilitator, <LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 2013</LINK>; music teacher specialised in teaching older people, <LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven of the 17 studies compared the music intervention with an active control intervention, all with the same number of sessions and frequency as the music group. Two-armed studies compared with the following interventions: reading (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gu_x00e9_tin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guétin 2009</LINK>), a cognitive stimulation intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>), painting (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>), cooking (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a </LINK>&#8212; also referred to as study 2; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2014</LINK>), or variable recreational activities which included handwork, playing shuffleboard, and also cooking and puzzle games (<LINK REF="STD-Vink-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vink 2013</LINK>). Two studies had three arms with the active control group working on jigsaw puzzles (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>); or receiving a passive group music intervention which did not meet our inclusion criteria for a therapeutic music-based intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcomes 'emotional well-being' including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect (also as part of behavioural scales), and 'behavioural problems' (agitation or aggression, and behaviour overall) and 'cognition' were often assessed. Social behaviour was less commonly assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2014</LINK>); and the meta-analyses of end-of-treatment scores included only the three studies from Narme and colleagues. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI, for agitation; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1986</LINK>), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, for cognition; <LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, for behaviour; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>) in particular were frequently used. Item-level NPI outcome data were reported in the article or the author additionally provided data about depression, anxiety, and agitation outcomes.</P>

<P>We screened a total of 737 records and we excluded 652 (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We excluded 69 of 85 records examined in full text (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for a selection of excluded studies which were close but did not qualify upon careful consideration). They were often excluded because the participants did not have dementia, or because of a design other than an RCT. Further, and often less obvious, we critically reviewed whether the intervention met the inclusion criteria for a music-based therapeutic intervention, and whether the reported outcomes included any assessments after fewer than five sessions. There are a number of studies on group music interventions such as group music in addition to movement interventions (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2006</LINK>): these were excluded because music was not the main or only therapeutic element, or was not provided with individual therapeutic intent. Further, some studies assessed outcomes during the treatment sessions only, combining immediate effects, for example on behaviour during the first session, with effects after multiple sessions (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Gerdner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdner 2000</LINK>). Studies awaiting classification included conference abstracts, articles about studies in Asia which we could not retrieve or evaluate in time, and new studies published after the search (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>).</P>

<P>There were a number of possible biases and often we could not assess the risk of bias due to poor reporting. Only risk of attrition bias was either low or unclear, as often no or only few participants were lost to follow-up and there were few missing outcome assessments. Risk of performance bias was high for all studies because participants and staff could not be blinded to the intervention. Regarding the other items, in more recent studies risk of bias was lower and the reporting in terms of interventions, rationale, chosen procedures, design and results was generally better. Still, we are unsure about the methodological quality of a number of studies because several items were rated as unclear.</P>

<P>All included studies were RCTs. However, the randomization procedure was not always described in detail (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).

<P>Blinding of therapists and participants to the intervention is not possible. Therefore, the studies are at high risk of performance bias even though therapists do not generally assess outcomes and participants may not be aware or have no specific expectations or are unable to self-report. The outcomes were assessed unblinded, by the research team or unblinded nurses, in at least four studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). For example, Narme and colleagues describe two studies differing in detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>). The first study involved a high risk of detection bias because the outcomes 'anxiety' (measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults, STAI-A) and, as assessed from the first two minutes of filmed interviews, 'emotions' (from facial expressions) and 'social behaviour' (discourse content), were assessed by nurses who were not blinded for the interventions (music intervention or painting) (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>). By contrast, in the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>), risk of detection bias was low because the outcomes were assessed by five independent observers who were blinded for the type of intervention (music intervention or cooking). Risk of detection bias resulted in downgrading of the quality of the evidence for all end-of-treatment outcomes (to 'serious'; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); and for all long-term outcomes (to 'very serious' &#8212; all outcome assessment was unblinded; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Self-reported outcomes were rarely employed. Incomplete outcome data were not identified as problematic in any of the studies. Occasionally death, hospitalisation, acute illness, or no interest in the therapy occurred across the different study arms; and cases with no outcome data were not included in the analyses. Therefore, attrition bias was probably not highly prevalent, and probably did not affect the pooled estimates. Newer studies often visualized cases lost to follow-up and missing outcome assessment in detail using flow diagrams. Nevertheless, in addition to the two oldest studies, some newer studies also only reported the number of cases randomized and analysed and did not explicitly report reasons for missing outcome data by study arm, or how these were handled.</P>

<P>Most studies did not refer to initial plans, a study protocol or trial registration. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent bias due to selective outcome reporting is pertinent. We found some indication of inconsistent reporting of primary and secondary outcomes which, however, did not seem to affect the pooled estimate (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>). Only one study clearly referred to a change in initial plans (<LINK REF="STD-Ceccato-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccato 2012</LINK>); and one study referred to a trial registration, and outcome reporting was consistent with the registration (<LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 2013</LINK>). We did not downgrade the quality of the evidence because of unclear risk of selective reporting.</P>
<P>Regarding publication bias: funnel plots for outcomes with sufficient studies (anxiety, 11 studies of which one with both a 'usual care' and 'other activity' control group, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; and agitation or aggression, 12 studies, also one with two types of control groups, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) indicate possible publication bias for the anxiety outcome.

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2017-04-11 00:47:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found some potential other sources of bias. Outcome assessment may be either imprecise or biased by the use of non-validated outcome measures with suboptimal distributions (such as skewed distributions, e.g. number of times yelling was observed; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998</LINK>) and different procedures for the baseline and outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 2013</LINK>).

Implementation fidelity, including non-adherence, was infrequently described, but <LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>, the only study with null findings, reported on this in detail. Finally, there may be bias through a financial or intellectual conflict of interest when funding was provided by a source with a potential interest in the effectiveness of music therapy. This may apply to two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ceccato-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccato 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ridder 2013</LINK>), but it should be noted that no source of funding was reported for more studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>).

<P>Of the 17 included studies, 16 studies with a total of 620 participants contributed to meta-analyses of effects. One study reported data on emotional well-being, social behaviour and cognition, but not in enough detail for us to include it in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK>). Several authors provided additional data such as SDs or item-level outcome data of scales for general behavioural assessments. We pooled data for all end-of-treatment outcomes, and for all but one long-term outcome &#8212; cognition &#8212; because there was only one study. Of note: of the 17 studies, all but one study &#8212; <LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK> &#8212; reported some significant improvement in outcomes of the music intervention versus control (all outcomes, including also, e.g. physiological outcomes that we did not evaluate). The methodological quality in terms of risk of bias, but also other quality considerations, varied substantially across the studies and the particular outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Emotional well-being including quality of life</HEADING>
<P>We included six studies with 181 participants in the analysis of end-of-treatment scores for the critically important outcome of emotional well-being and quality of life. In half of the studies, a validated quality-of-life measure was used (the Dementia Quality of Life, DQOL (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>), a German translation of the Dementia Quality of Life Instrument, DEMQOL (<LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>), and a Danish translation of the Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease-Related Quality of Life, ADRQL (<LINK REF="STD-Ridder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ridder 2013</LINK>). In the three studies conducted by Narme and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2014</LINK>) emotional well-being referred to counts of positive and negative facial expressions as assessed from the first two minutes of filmed interviews. There was no clear evidence of an effect at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; standardized mean difference, SMD 0.32, 95% CI &#8722;0.08 to 0.71; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Heterogeneity was only low to moderate (I² = 38%; Chi² P = 0.15). There was no blinding of outcome assessment in two of the six studies. The overall quality for effects of music-based interventions on emotional well-being and quality of life at end of treatment was low, downgraded for serious risk of bias and imprecision (wide confidence interval). The quality was very low for long-term outcomes for which there were only two very small studies and very serious imprecision (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2014</LINK>). There was no clear evidence of an effect (SMD 0.47, 95% CI &#8722;0.10 to 1.05; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), but because of the very low quality, this is a very uncertain result.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mood disturbance or negative affect: depression</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies contributed 376 participants to the analysis on end-of-treatment effect (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>) and five studies contributed 234 participants to the analysis on long-term effects. Depression or depressive symptoms were measured with (translated versions of) the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or with a subscale of the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Heterogeneity was not important (I² = 0%) for either end-of-treatment or long-term outcomes. We downgraded both outcomes for risk of bias, due to lack of blinding in many studies. Imprecision was more of an issue for long-term outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate for end-of-treatment effects and very low for long-term outcomes. We found that music-based therapeutic interventions probably reduced depressive symptoms at the end of treatment (SMD &#8722;0.28, 95% CI &#8722;0.48 to &#8722;0.07; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). There was no evidence of a reduction in the longer term, with a smaller estimate and a confidence interval including no effect (SMD &#8722;0.01, 95% CI &#8722;0.27 to 0.24; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) although again the very low quality of the evidence made this result very uncertain.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mood disturbance or negative affect: anxiety</HEADING>
<P>The other mood item we considered was anxiety. For this outcome, at the end of treatment, we included 11 studies with 365 participants. A variety of (translated) outcome measures were used; Rating Anxiety in Dementia Scale (RAID), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-A), Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and subscale scores of the BEHAVE-AD and NPI. Heterogeneity was substantial for end-of-treatment effects (I² = 56%; Chi² P = 0.009) and longer-term effects (I² = 72%; Chi² P = 0.006). In addition to serious inconsistency, there was serious risk of bias, imprecision and &#8212; for the end of treatment outcome &#8212; possible publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Hence we judged the quality of the evidence at both time points to be very low. We can therefore have very little confidence in the results. Anxiety was lower in the music intervention group at the end of treatment (SMD &#8722;0.50, 95% CI &#8722;0.84 to &#8722;0.16; 11 studies with 365 participants; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>), but not in the longer term (SMD &#8722;0.23, 95% CI &#8722;0.86 to 0.41; 5 studies with 160 participants; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behavioural problems: agitation or aggression</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies with 515 participants contributed to the end-of-treatment effect analysis, and four studies with 225 participants contributed to the long-term effect analysis. Outcome measures used for agitation were (translated versions of) the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the agitation subscale of the NPI; and for aggression, the aggressiveness subscale of the BEHAVE-AD and counts of observed aggressive behaviour. Heterogeneity was low to moderate at end of treatment and longer term (I² = 27%, Chi² P = 0.18, and I² = 37%, Chi² P = 0.19, respectively). Inconsistency and imprecision were not serious for the end-of-treatment outcome, but inconsistency was serious for the long-term outcome, as was imprecision. Both outcomes were downgraded for risk of bias. There was no evidence of publication bias (regarding end-of-treatment effect; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate for the end-of-treatment outcome but very low for the long-term outcome. We found no evidence of an effect on agitation or aggression at the end of treatment (SMD &#8722;0.08, 95% CI &#8722;0.29 to 0.14; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>) nor in the long term (SMD &#8722;0.02, 95% CI &#8722;0.36 to 0.33; ; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>

<P>Six studies with 209 participants contributed to the end-of-treatment effect analysis, and three studies with 125 participants contributed to the analysis of longer term effects. Outcome measures were (translated versions of) the BEHAVE-AD and NPI. Heterogeneity was low to moderate for the end of treatment effect (I² = 36%, Chi² P = 0.15). The quality of the evidence was low due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. We found no evidence of an effect of music-based therapeutic interventions on problematic behaviour overall at the end of treatment (SMD &#8722;0.20, 95% CI &#8722;0.56 to 0.17; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>).

For all, the outcome was the contents of conversation (positive versus negative expressions when interviewed about current feelings and personal history). <LINK REF="STD-Lord-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1993</LINK> reported on effects on their self-made questionnaire on social interaction, mood and recall (combined outcome) but there were no separate figures for social interaction and therefore we could not use the data for the meta-analysis. We downgraded the evidence at both time points due to serious or very serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision. There was also moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 54%, Chi² P = 0.14) in the long-term analysis. We considered the quality of the evidence to be very low for both outcomes and were therefore very uncertain about the result of more positive expressions in the music-based interventions group at the end of treatment (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.02; 3 studies; I² = 0%, Chi² P = 0.70; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).

We used the MMSE data if these were available in addition to other cognition measures such as Prose Memory tests, the FAS-Test (Controlled-Oral-Word-Association Test), or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The end-of-treatment results were imprecise but not inconsistent. There was no important heterogeneity (I² = 0%; Chi² P = 0.84). There was serious risk of bias. The overall quality of the evidence was low and suggested that music-based interventions may not affect cognition at the end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI &#8722;0.04 to 0.45; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>).

<P>The sensitivity analyses with analyses restricted to studies where the intervention was definitely or possibly delivered by a qualified music therapist resulted in similar end-of-treatment effect estimates (there was no sensitivity analysis for the social behaviour outcome because no study remained). When restricting to studies that were definitely delivered by a music therapist, most effects were similar, but there was a smaller effect on anxiety. In the four of 11 studies in which the intervention was definitely delivered by a music therapist, the estimate for anxiety was &#8722;0.15 (SMD &#8722;0.15, 95% CI &#8722;0.54 to 0.24; with less heterogeneity; I² = 16%, Chi² P = 0.31; 129 participants).</P>

<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of music-based therapeutic interventions on a range of outcomes relevant for people with dementia. The specific focus was to assess whether they can improve emotional well-being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour, and cognition.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies have been included in this review, and we were able to perform meta-analyses on effects at the end of treatment and longer term (mostly four weeks after treatment ended). We found moderate-quality evidence that at the end of treatment music-based therapeutic interventions improved depressive symptoms and did not improve agitation or aggression, and low-quality evidence that it had no effect on emotional well-being including quality of life, overall behavioural problems and cognition. There was very low quality evidence of benefit on anxiety and social behaviour. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the effects were not larger in studies in which the intervention was delivered by a qualified music therapist. There was no evidence of effects four weeks or more after the end of treatment, but the quality of this evidence for all outcomes was also very low.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-08 10:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only three studies used social behaviour as an outcome, and these were from a single group of researchers in France (<LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2012_x002d_study-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2012-study 1a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narme-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Narme 2014</LINK>). The evidence in this review applies to therapeutic effects of music-based therapeutic interventions after at least five sessions. It excludes some group interventions which involved music, but where music was not the main or only therapeutic element. It excludes direct effects during sessions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-21 15:15:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence was moderate for depression and for agitation or aggression at the end of treatment. For all other outcomes it was low or very low. All end-of-treatment outcomes were downgraded for risk of bias; all except depression and agitation or aggression were downgraded for imprecision; and some outcomes were also downgraded for inconsistency.</P>
<P>Many studies used validated outcome measures for behaviour (e.g. the NPI (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>) or BEHAVE-AD (<LINK REF="REF-Reisberg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisberg 1987</LINK>)), two widely used measures which are recommended because of favourable psychometric properties (<LINK REF="REF-Jeon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeon 2011</LINK>), and for cognition (e.g. the MMSE (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>)). We included subscales of the behavioural scales as outcome measures. However, there is less evidence for validity of subscales compared to total scores (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2014</LINK>). We combined agitation and aggression in meta-analyses because this is consistent with the definition given by the International Psychogeriatric Association (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2015</LINK>); and these items are also combined in the widely used CMAI (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1986</LINK>). Some have raised conceptual issues such as overlap of a broad definition of agitation with resistance to care (<LINK REF="REF-Volicer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volicer 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the reporting was sometimes poor which resulted in uncertainty about the exact methodological quality of the included studies and the evidence for effects. Overall, the studies had small sample sizes. Few studies reported on fidelity of the implementation of the music intervention and other activities, or on other aspects of a process evaluation. Implementation fidelity is often defined as the degree to which an intervention or programme is delivered as intended (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2007</LINK>); and in music therapy trial specifically, treatment fidelity refers to "methodological strategies used to monitor the delivery of the music therapy intervention as described in the treatment manual" (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2012</LINK>). Treatment fidelity includes adherence to an intervention, exposure or dose, quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and programme differentiation to identify essential components of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2007</LINK>), and therefore includes, but is not limited to, participant (or staff) adherence and responsiveness.</P>
<P>Some of the included studies selected people with agitated behaviour before the intervention, or people who were more likely to be interested in music-based interventions. On the other hand, there were studies in which people with musical knowledge were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2010a</LINK>), or without such selection criteria. Dropout was mostly due to health-related conditions such as hospitalisation, illness or mortality. Dropout due to lack of interest was reported for a control activity (cognitive stimulation programme) and dropout due to "problems in the group" in a music intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>), but none of the other studies reported any unfavourable effects of the music-based interventions. We do not know if there were any unreported adverse effects such as a sore throat after singing. We also do not know if, without selectively including people based on subjective judgement of whether they will probably accept the intervention, some individuals with dementia might experience disadvantages of the intervention. Possibly, effects in these studies depend on participants having problems at baseline (being selected as in need of treatment for specific problems) and hence to there being substantial room for improvement. Specific subgroups might benefit from music-based therapeutic interventions more than others.</P>
<P>There may be publication bias through selective reporting of studies and selective outcome reporting in the relevant literature. Although few protocols were registered, we found inconsistencies in the reporting of outcome measures in one study that reported on the study in multiple papers (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>). Moreover, despite most of the meta-analyses we ran not resulting in significant pooled effects, 16 of the 17 studies (all, except for <LINK REF="STD-Liesk-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Liesk 2015</LINK>) reported at least one significant effect. For some studies this included outcomes beyond the scope of this review, such as heart rate, but it could indicate selective reporting of significant findings or analytic methods that resulted in significant findings. Further, the funnel plot showing end-of-treatment effects on anxiety suggested possible publication bias. There may also be a financial conflict of interest if the study is funded by a source interested in the outcomes, or an intellectual conflict of interest in case the study is performed by the music therapist who authors the article, but there were insufficient data to examine possible effects of conflicts of interest.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-11 01:24:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent review on effects of music therapy on behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia found larger SMDs for behavioural problems overall (&#8722;0.49, 95% CI &#8722;0.82 to &#8722;0.17) and for anxiety (&#8722;0.64, 95% CI &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;0.24) compared with our findings (<LINK REF="REF-Ueda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueda 2013</LINK>). However, that review included non-randomized trials and cohort studies and studies which we excluded because they did not meet our criteria for therapeutic interventions. They found an even larger effect for studies that lasted three months or longer (&#8722;0.93, 95% CI &#8722;1.72 to &#8722;0.13), a subgroup we did not analyse separately.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK> included 10 studies, including <LINK REF="STD-Raglio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Raglio 2008</LINK> which we excluded in the updated version of our review because after re-evaluation, we judged this to be a quasi-randomized study; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2006</LINK> which after re-evaluation did not meet our criteria for a music-based therapeutic intervention (it was music with movement); and <LINK REF="STD-Janata-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Janata 2012</LINK> which we excluded because streaming music also did not meet our criteria for a therapeutic intervention. <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK> included studies that compared with usual care, excluding other activities except for reading sessions as the comparator (<LINK REF="STD-Gu_x00e9_tin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guétin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010</LINK>; perhaps also including a study on ICU patients with no dementia). Our review had a longer search period than 2000 to 2014 and we included articles in French and German. Both we and <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK> found substantial heterogeneity in our analyses of anxiety, but we also found that the funnel plot indicated possible publication bias and that the quality of the evidence for an effect on anxiety was very low. Effect sizes for cognition were smaller than for mood in both reviews. However, <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK> found a significant effect on "disruptive behaviours" whereas we did not find evidence of an effect on behavioural problems (agitation/aggression), and we found an effect on depression which they did not, despite a larger effect size than in our review (&#8722;0.39 and &#8722;0.28, respectively).</P>
<P>A recent review by <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2017</LINK> included non-randomized studies and studies that we excluded because of insufficient therapeutic-based goals and their methods and findings differed in a number of other ways. Their subgroup analyses for effect on "disruptive behaviour" (overall behavioural scales and agitation) suggested a higher SMD for non-randomized studies (&#8722;1.02 versus &#8722;0.65 (text) or &#8722;0.52 (Table) for parallel RCTs). They found a larger SMD for disruptive behaviour (&#8722;0.42, 95% CI &#8722;0.74 to &#8722;0.11, compared to &#8722;0.20 in our work). Compared to our review, they found a similar SMD for cognition (SMD 0.20, 95% CI &#8722;0.09 to 0.49), and smaller SMDs for anxiety (&#8722;0.20, 95% CI &#8722;0.37 to &#8722;0.02), depression (SMD &#8722;0.16, 95% CI &#8722;0.41 to 0.08) and quality of life (SMD &#8722;0.12, &#8722;0.36 to 0.12; negative SMDs however favoured music therapy). <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2017</LINK> performed different analyses, probably comparing scores before and after the intervention to calculate a SMD with a general check of whether there were baseline differences. This may explain different SMDs also for individual studies, and the quality assessments of the same included studies rarely corresponded with ours. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Svansdottir-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Svansdottir 2006</LINK> was an outlier for effect on behaviour in <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2017</LINK> (SMD &#8722;3.88), compared with an SMD of &#8722;0.06 for end-of-treatment scores in our work. Also, in this case, <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2017</LINK> assigned points for quality because of blinding of the therapist whereas we rated high risk for performance bias for all studies (in view of standardized methods to allow for comparison of very different interventions and situations) and in this case, <LINK REF="STD-Svansdottir-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Svansdottir 2006</LINK> also disclosed that the first author "conducted the music therapy." <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2017</LINK> judged all studies to be of acceptable quality, even those with a total score of 3 (Supplemental table) or higher than 4 (text) on a 0 to 10 scale where one of the items was the random allocation. Finally, their secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety and quality of life) were prioritised in our review because of the evident importance for the person with dementia him/herself.</P>
<P>Multiple other recent reviews have summarized effects and concluded, without meta-analyses, that the intervention is beneficial. Some focused on specific outcomes such as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Raglio-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raglio 2012</LINK>); or covered different types of outcomes such as physiological outcomes (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2013</LINK>. who also noted a lack of evidence on long-term effects). <LINK REF="REF-Petrovsky-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrovsky 2015</LINK> focused on effects on anxiety and depression in people with mild dementia, but included studies with participants who had varying severity of dementia as long as it was not limited to severe dementia. They found that the evidence was inconclusive based on 10 studies, including some with a pre-post test design. We were able to include more RCTs because authors provided data about mood items in overall behavioural scales. <LINK REF="REF-Ing_x002d_Randolph-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing-Randolph 2015</LINK> reviewed effects of group music interventions, including music therapy, on anxiety. They found that music interventions reduced anxiety in seven of eight included studies.</P>
<P>The clinical importance of the effect of music-based interventions on depression is somewhat uncertain because of the variety of scales used, although there was no heterogeneity in effects across the studies. The SMD for depression (&#8722;0.28) and anxiety (&#8722;0.50; but very uncertain due to serious risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency and probable publication bias) was within the range of, or larger than, pooled estimates of effects of medication on depression in people with dementia (antidepressants, 6 trials, SMD favouring medication 0.29, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.60, <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 12 trials, effect sizes favouring medication 0.06 to 0.10, <LINK REF="REF-Sepehry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepehry 2012</LINK>). There may be fewer side effects of music-based therapeutic interventions compared with medication.</P>

<P>Music-based therapeutic interventions may be used for people with dementia residing in institutional settings, to treat depressive symptoms. Depression is very common in people with dementia irrespective of the stage of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Verkaik-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verkaik 2007</LINK>); and it is related to low quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Banerjee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banerjee 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beerens-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beerens 2014</LINK>). It is not clear whether effects will persist beyond the intervention period and music-based interventions may need to be continued for prolonged periods for a sustained effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-21 16:16:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Guidelines for the design and implementation of RCTs of music therapy are available (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2012</LINK>). For dementia, more well-conducted studies are needed to establish more precisely the effects of music therapy and related interventions in the treatment of people with dementia, including effects on positive outcomes such as emotional well-being, quality of life and social behaviour. Outcomes may also cover behaviour that may not be disturbing to others but compromises quality of life, such as apathy, which is highly prevalent and often highly persistent over the course of dementia (dementia or cognitive impairment, <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Linde-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Linde 2016</LINK>; Alzheimer's disease, <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2016</LINK>). Outcomes such as pain and discomfort have been used for testing effects of music therapy at the end of life, mostly among people with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-McConnell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 2016</LINK>); these are also important outcomes for people with dementia. Overall behavioural scales (which include items on hallucinations, euphoria, etc.) might be rather too broad for use as outcome scales for effects of music therapy. Future studies should follow the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of randomized trials, use adequate methods of randomization with adequate concealment of allocation of the participants to (parallel) treatment groups, blind the outcome assessors to treatment allocation (and report this) and be of sufficient duration to assess persistence of effects after the end of treatment. Blinding of participants is difficult but not impossible, especially with active control groups, when the participants are unaware of the hypothesis of the study and which intervention is considered the active intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2012</LINK>). We discourage the use of cross-over designs because possible long-term effects of music-based interventions risk carry-over effects when crossing over. Study protocols should be registered and primary and secondary outcomes should be reported accordingly. Reporting of effects should preferably include mean differences and standard deviation of differences between baseline and follow-up, or effect sizes, which only a few studies (namely <LINK REF="STD-Ceccato-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccato 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ridder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ridder 2013</LINK>) have reported so far. Funding sources should be reported and any potential conflict of interest through possible interest in the outcomes should be considered and disclosed, such as an interest in finding favourable effects of the therapy. This also includes cases where the therapist delivering the intervention (co)authors the article.</P>
<P>More research is needed to differentiate between various therapeutic approaches using music: to examine, for example, whether there is a difference between receptive and active approaches, or how response relates to duration of individual sessions (noting that any dose-response relationships may not be linear, due to participants' difficulties with sustaining concentration or the risk of overstimulation with longer sessions). It is important to establish whether pre-existing problematic or challenging behaviour moderates the effects. Further research is also required to compare music-based therapeutic activities in which music is the main or only therapeutic element, to other group activities involving music. If more data were available, it would be helpful for future analyses to distinguish between usual care and other musical or non-musical activities in the control group. In the existing literature, the professional background of the therapist was sometimes unclear, or there was no information about the training of the music therapists or their experience of delivering music-based therapeutic interventions specifically to people with dementia. It is important to provide detail on who delivers the intervention in order to facilitate classification of interventions as music therapy delivered by a qualified, trained and experienced music therapist, other music-based therapeutic interventions, or other interventions involving music, and to allow corresponding subgroup analyses. However, targeted studies may be more appropriate to evaluate effects of training because subgroup analyses risk confounding if, for example, qualified therapists see people with more complex problems. Further studies may also focus on effects in special groups such as young-onset dementia, or on different settings, including community settings with more people with early dementia.</P>

<P>We adapted terminology for relevant outcomes. The protocol formulated the objective in terms of problems only while emotions and (social) behaviour is broader than that (protocol: &#8220;To assess the effects of music therapy in the treatment of behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional problems in older people with dementia.&#8221;). In the review, we now consistently refer to: (1) emotional well-being including quality of life; mood disturbance or negative affect, which includes (2) depression and (3) anxiety; behavioural problems which includes (4) agitation or aggression, and (5) behaviour overall; (6) social behaviour; and (7) cognition. We also searched for any (other) possible adverse effects. We adapted the objectives in the abstract to cover both the original aims and how we broadened it to include more positive outcomes as well. Also, the protocol referred to effects in "older people" but there has not been an exclusion criterion based on age. We therefore dropped reference to "older" people.</P>
<P>Publications were assessed by two, and not three reviewers independently. Data were extracted by two reviewers and if needed, in consultation with other reviewers as per protocol. We included RCTs only because unlike at the time the protocol was written, we expected more RCTs to be available. We accepted a physician's diagnosis of dementia if no data on formal criteria such as DSM-IV, DSM-5 or comparable instruments were available for reason of relevance to clinical practice and known underreporting. We did not analyse by length of treatment (months, length in three groups as in the protocol), but we analysed end-of-treatment data accepting variable durations and number of sessions as long as the outcomes were assessed after a minimum of five sessions. Rather, we aimed at assessing long-term effects, analysing data about assessments at a minimum of four weeks after the end of treatment (with at least five studies available).</P>
<P>We used more stringent criteria with respect to: (1) assessing whether an article reported about a music intervention with an individual therapeutic intent, including &#8212; but not limited to &#8212; interventions provided by qualified music therapists, (2) analyses referring to outcome assessments after a minimum of five sessions or analyses that include earlier assessments if there is evidence of no different effect over time, (3) control group, and (4) risk of bias.</P>
<P>Regarding (4): if no research protocol was available, risk of reporting bias was set to either unclear or, for specific reasons, as high (also if rated as low in previous versions of the review). With regard to (1), we defined music-based therapeutic interventions or music therapy as: therapy provided by a qualified music therapist, or an intervention meeting at least two of the following criteria: (a) therapeutic objective which may include communication, relationships, learning, mobilisation, expression, mobilisation and other relevant therapeutic objectives; (b) music matches individual preferences; (c) active participation of the people with dementia using music instruments; (d) participants had a clinical indication for the interventions or were referred to the intervention by a clinician. We also required music to be a main element of the intervention (e.g. not moving with use of music). We therefore focused on therapeutic aspects and elements that are more complex and required special skills while also targeted to the individual compared with, for example, playing recorded music for a group activity. We did not require a certified music therapist to provide the intervention, because the profession, exact qualification, training and experience was often unclear, and training programmes may vary between countries. Moreover, the importance of requiring a qualification is unclear in relation to the importance of having experience with the specific needs of people with dementia (for example, a trained music therapist with no experience in comparison with a musician with years of experience in providing therapy to people with dementia). Further (point 3), we required control groups to not receive any music-based therapeutic intervention (even if fewer sessions than the active intervention group).We re-assessed previously included studies by the new criteria and when in doubt, we consulted the lead author of the earlier versions.</P>
<P>Finally, we conducted a series of post hoc sensitivity analyses to explore possible effects of using more stringent criteria with respect to a requirement of a music therapist to deliver the intervention, and funding by parties with a possible interest in effectiveness of music therapy.</P>

<P>2016: this new citation version was written with three additional authors. Inclusion of studies until the 2011 update were reconsidered according to the new and more stringent criteria. A further update is planned for the end of 2017 to incorprate studies awaiting classification.</P>
<P>May 2004: this is a completely new review of music-based interventions for people with dementia written by a new and different team of reviewers (Vink and colleagues) from the previous, now permanently withdrawn review of music therapy (Koger and colleagues).</P>

<P>Questionable outcome measure and distribution. The authors report in the article on the effects of the extreme intra-subject and inter-subject variability characteristic of this population in this study.</P>
<P>Quote: "For example, one subject was responsible for 408 and 84 occurrences of yelling behaviour in the no music and music conditions, respectively". Therefore, highly skewed distributions (the observation hardly occurred) causing imprecision.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Participants in the control group frequently developed an acute illness resulting in missing sessions. Quote: "Während keiner der 12 Teilnehmer des MP akut erkrankte, fielen 5 der 12 Teil­nehmer des KS zwischen zwei und vier Sitzungen aus." (While none of the 12 participants in the music intervention group became acutely ill, 5 of the 12 participants in the cognitive stimulation group missed between two and four sessions). People who attended fewer than 8 of 12 sessions were excluded from the analyses, so these people still contributed to outcome data. Therefore, adherence or fidelity may be a problem even though they already preselected people who were probably interested in music therapy.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We were unable to reproduce the results. No statistical tests were reported for the between-group comparisons, only for the within-group.</P>
<P>The article reports that the number of correct answers for each of the 3 groups was summed for baseline and post treatment, and then a 1-way analysis of variance conducted. No information on how the data were analysed, whether the baseline was used as a covariate. Table 1 analysis of variance, although showing significant differences between the 3 therapies, does not seem valid. For example, the degrees of freedom within groups are not correct. To interpret this table far more information is required. Even if the results in table 2 are accepted, all that can be deduced is that the treatments were different. They may be different in the level of participation in the therapies, but that does not explain whether the therapy itself brought any benefit.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Music-based therapeutic intervention: Sound Training for Attention and Memory in Dementia (STAM-Dem) (versus a control group of usual care)</HEADING>
<P>A 45-minute mixed (active and receptive) group intervention delivered by &#8220;professionally trained music therapists trained to administer the STAM-Dem protocol.&#8221; Highly structured, progressive series music sessions, with a minimum of four and a maximum of five participants per group. The music therapists were instructed to &#8220;pay attention to the relational atmosphere&#8221; and &#8220;maintain the level of motivation as high as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>The intervention included &#8220;step-by-step exercises aimed at stimulating and checking both attention and memory.&#8221; Participants were asked to perform specific movements, count, clap hands, alternate clapping hands and tapping the table, repeat sequences of previously recorded sounds (not stated how) after listening to recorded and live played music. It is a mixed intervention because the active component was combined with listening to music.</P>
<P>The STAM-Dem protocol comprises four phases, one for each specific cognitive function that is trained (selective attention, sustained attention, alternate attention and working memory). The phases involve: 1) stimulus-movement association, 2) reaction to acoustic stimuli, 3) shifting attention with two exercises, and 4) orderly and inverted repetition. It is not clear from the text if the phases each last four sessions, and are progressive, but as described in other sources (not cited in the article) they are (<A HREF="http://stamprotocol.blogspot.nl/p/eng.html">STAM protocol</A>). Each phase then lasts four sessions and is followed by the next. However, the intervention phase lasted 12 weeks, in which 24 sessions were held.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Music-based therapeutic intervention: preferred, recorded music during bathing episodes with aggressive behaviour (versus a control group with no music during bathing)</HEADING>
<P>A receptive individual intervention with music, listening through speakers, delivered by nursing staff. Duration followed established nursing routines and varied from 11 to 18 minutes.</P>
<P>Preferred music was recorded and selections played via an audiotape recorder during the bathing episode. Background information on participants&#8217; music experiences and preferences was obtained by interviews with the family member or responsible agent. &#8220;Bathing times were scheduled for either morning or afternoon&#8221; &#8220;following established nursing routines.&#8221; Participants received either a partial bath which was given in the participant&#8217;s room, or a full bath, which was given in the shower on the nursing unit.</P>
<P>Nursing staff delivered the bathing session. It is not clear from the text whether nursing staff were responsible for turning on the music, but it is highly probable that this was done by the observer: &#8220;Initially, consideration was given to having nursing staff be responsible for turning on the audiotape recorder...However, during pilot testing of the procedures, this proved too cumbersome for already overburdened nursing staff.&#8221; The sessions were given 10 times over two weeks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Music-based therapeutic intervention: Active group music sessions with live and recorded music (versus a reading group as the control condition)</HEADING>
<P>An active, structured 40-minute group music session delivered by two musicians. The session consisted of singing and playing on instruments accompanied by live familiar songs and recorded instrumental music. The group had a maximum of 16 participants.</P>
<P>The session covered 30 minutes of musician-led familiar song-singing with guitar accompaniment, and 10 minutes of pre-recorded instrumental music. A set repertoire was established for each of three sessions and this was repeated for eight weeks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Residents were encouraged to participate actively through singing/humming, playing instruments and&#8230; movement.&#8221; Choice of the instruments is not described. The repertoire selection was based primarily on participants&#8217; musical preferences, musicians&#8217; repertoire knowledge, and the findings from a practice session (conducted in an alternative aged care setting). The 10 minutes of listening to pre-recorded music allowed the musicians and participants to have a short rest from performance and singing and to cater for participants who had a preference for more instrumental music. The sessions were delivered three mornings a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for eight weeks, with a total of 24 sessions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Control intervention: reading group</HEADING>
<P>An interactive reading session included a range of reading and social activities, such as reading local news stories, short stories, telling jokes and undertaking quiz activities. The sessions were led by one trained Research Assistant. A maximum number of attendees is not clear from the text. The control sessions took 40 minutes, and were delivered three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for eight weeks, totaling a number of 24 sessions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Music-based therapeutic intervention: Individual receptive therapy with the &#8216;U&#8216; sequence method (versus a reading group as the control condition)</HEADING>
<P>An individual receptive music therapy method, the &#8216;U-sequence&#8217; method involved listening to music sequences, selected from a limited number of musical styles delivered through headphones, in the patient&#8217;s room. The musical style was chosen based on the patients&#8217; personal tastes following an interview or questionnaire. From the suggested different musical styles, a musical sequence was selected. This usual musical sequence, lasting 20 minutes, was broken down into several phases, according to the &#8216;U sequence&#8217; method and making use of a computer program especially designed for this method. Musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequency and volume were reduced. After a phase of sustained reduced musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequency and volume, a re-enlivening phase followed in which musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequency and volume increased again, and ended at a moderate level in comparison to the beginning phase. The style of music varied from one session to another for a given patient.</P>
<P>&#8220;Patients were either in a supine position or seated in a comfortable armchair and were offered a mask so as to avoid visual stimuli.&#8221; Details on the &#8216;U sequence&#8217; method are retrievable through this external link (not included in the paper): <A HREF="http://www.music-care.com/en/page/treatment">http://www.music-care.com/en/page/treatment</A>
</P>
<P>Sessions were extended by a period of time spent listening to the patient. This period of time served &#8220;to create a &#8216;psychotherapist&#8217;-type of therapeutic relationship and &#8230;reinforced the effect triggered by listening to music.&#8221; Duration of this &#8216;listening&#8217; intervention with a therapist was not reported.</P>
<P>Personnel delivering the music and the listening intervention is not clear from the text. Sessions were delivered once a week, lasted 20 minutes (plus time spent listening to patients' responses &#8211; duration of which is not stated), and 16 sessions were delivered.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Music-based therapeutic intervention: A &#8216;Musikgeragogik&#8217; group music programme (versus a cognitive stimulation intervention as the control condition)</HEADING>
<P>A 90-minute structured active group music intervention based on the principles of &#8216;Musikgeragogik&#8217; by T Hartogh (2005) which was designated as &#8220;music education for elders.&#8221; Sessions consisted of singing folk songs, rounds and playing on instruments (woodblocks, bells, tambourine and maracas). Participants were stimulated to improvise in a structured way according to cues in the song lyrics, alternated with spontaneous expression of individual impressions provoked by the songs that were played or sung. It is probable that the music used was live as the music intervention was &#8220;created as an active therapy form,&#8221; but this is not explicitly mentioned in the text.</P>
<P>A music recreational therapist (&#8216;Musikgeragogin&#8217;) delivered the intervention. Duration of sessions was 90 minutes and frequency was twice a week, during six weeks, totaling 12 sessions.</P>

<P>This was a 30-minute structured mixed group music therapy intervention, based on the protocol developed by Clair and Bernstein (1990). The size of the group is not clear from the text.</P>
<P>The intervention consisted of rhythmic music and slow-tempo instrumental activities (choice of instruments not specified), therapeutic singing, listening to specially selected music, glockenspiel playing and musical activities and traditional holiday and &#8216;music creator&#8217; activities. &#8220;&#8230;before the therapy sessions a subject&#8217;s fondness for music was evaluated through an interview, and the musical activities in the group sessions were arranged according to the interview findings.&#8221;</P>
<P>The person delivering the intervention was a researcher schooled in two university music therapy courses. The sessions lasted 30 minutes and were conducted twice a week for six consecutive weeks. The total number of sessions was 12.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study 1</HEADING>
<P>A 2-hour structured mixed group intervention, with a maximum of 12 participants. Music selections were chosen independent of participants&#8217; preference and were played through a loudspeaker. The selections varied from classical music to songs from the 1950s and included instrumental and vocal music, and varied from &#8216;calming&#8217; to &#8216;dynamic&#8217; music. Calming music was used at the start and end of each session. The order of the musical selections was the same for every session, and pieces were played twice if participants expressed the wish to hear a song again. Participants were encouraged to play along (on percussion instruments, maracas or bell chains), sing and improvise. Participants were stimulated to express their feeling and memories evoked by the activity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Control intervention study 1</HEADING>
<P>The control intervention in study 1 was another pleasant art therapy intervention. Painting session offered participants the use of wax crayons, colouring pencils, felt pens and gouache painting. They were stimulated to create simple drawings, to make circular movements with different materials and to make drawings based on their imagination. Participants were also encouraged to express their feeling and memories evoked by the activity.</P>
<P>Personnel delivering the two interventions were two psychologists. All sessions lasted two hours and were delivered twice a week during three weeks, totaling 12 hours during six sessions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Control intervention study 2</HEADING>
<P>The control intervention in study 2 was cooking, because it was a pleasant activity that stimulates a number of senses. There was more interaction compared to the painting control condition. Further, more similar with the music therapy intervention, the cooking intervention also involved alternating productive (prepare a recipe) and receptive phases (taste a dessert). The sessions included preparing a different recipe collectively, with roles distributed according to the participants' abilities. Participants were encouraged to taste ingredients, and verbalize remembrances.</P>

<P>A 30-minute active non-verbal group music therapy intervention, in which free musical improvisation is used to build a relationship between participant and music therapist. Groups had a size of three participants. The intervention focuses on favouring the moments of attunement that help organise and regulate the participants&#8217; behaviours and emotions. Participants and music therapist interact and express their feelings and emotions through non-verbal behaviours and using musical instruments. Note that this approach is inspired by the intersubjective psychology (Fogel 1993; Stern 1985, 2004; Trevarthen &amp; Aitkin 2001; Tronick 1998; references provided in the article).</P>
<P>A music therapist delivered the sessions. The sessions were delivered in three non-continuous treatment cycles consisting of four weeks of three sessions per week followed by one month of no treatment (washout; however, not in the context of a cross-over design). The total number of sessions was 36, within a period of six months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Music-based therapeutic intervention: Individual mixed music therapy (versus a control group with usual care)</HEADING>
<P>An individual mixed music therapy intervention, not pre-structured, delivered by music therapists with an average duration of almost 34 minutes (33.8, SD 9.91). The aim of the music therapy was phrased in a more positive way than a goal of reducing, e.g. challenging behaviour ("to facilitate initiative, engagement, self-expression and mutual understanding"). The authors refer to Tom Kitwood for the theoretical basis of a relation-based and person-centred approach in music therapy.</P>
<P>Vocal or instrumental improvisation, singing, dancing/moving, listening and talking/going for a walk could be part of the session. The music accompanying the activities was pre-recorded or live music, and consisted of &#8216;free&#8217; improvisation or based on songs/melodies. The overall aim of the music therapy was to facilitate initiative, engagement, self-expression and mutual understanding. Clinicians were instructed to be aware of at least three different ways of applying music in therapy: catching attention and creating a safe setting, regulating arousal level to a point where self-regulation is possible and engaging in social communication to fulfil psychosocial needs. The session was not especially focused on decreasing agitation.</P>
<P>Music therapists with university-level training delivered the intervention which were twice a week for a period of six weeks, with 12 sessions offered in total. The average number of sessions received was 10 (SD 2.82, range 0 to 13).</P>
