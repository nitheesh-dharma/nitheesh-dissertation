<TITLE MODIFIED="2015-05-28 09:27:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">Transfusions of white blood cells called granulocytes for preventing infections in people who lack functioning granulocytes</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We evaluated the evidence about whether granulocyte transfusions given to prevent infection are safe and decrease the risk of infection. Our target population was people with neutropenia (a very low count of a type of white blood cell (neutrophil), or white blood cells that did not function properly (neutrophil dysfunction).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Functioning white blood cells, in particular granulocytes, are important for fighting life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. For many years, some hospital physicians have been giving granulocyte transfusions to people who lack white cells as a result of disease and/or treatment that has reduced their number or function.</P>
<P>The demand for granulocytes for transfusion has shown a steady increase since the 1990s mainly as a result of the introduction of a drug called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) which, if given to donors, leads to increased granulocyte numbers in the donor's blood and the collection of a larger dose of granulocytes than was previously possible.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>The evidence is current to April 2015. In this update, 12 trials were identified that compared giving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections compared to not giving granulocytes to prevent infection. One trial has not yet been completed. Eleven trials containing a total of 653 participants were reviewed. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2006. Data from one trial were not included in the analyses because patients were included within the trial more than once. Ten studies included only adults, and two studies included children and adults.</P>
<P>Six studies reported their funding sources, and all were funded by charities or governments.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Giving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections did not affect the risk of death due to infection, or the risk of death due to any cause.</P>
<P>Giving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections decreased the number of people who had a bacterial or fungal infection in the blood, but did not decrease the number of people having a localised bacterial or fungal infection.</P>
<P>It is unknown whether granulocyte transfusions increased the risk of having a serious adverse event because adverse events were only reported in people receiving granulocyte transfusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The evidence for most of the findings was of very low or low quality. This was because patients and their doctors knew which study arm the patient had been allocated to and two of the studies were not true randomised studies (patients were allocated to the granulocyte transfusion arm if they had a suitable granulocyte donor).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy, bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or therapy-related neutropenia. Since the late 1990s there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in people who lack their own functional granulocytes. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-05-21 14:16:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions compared with a control population not receiving this intervention for preventing all-cause mortality, mortality due to infection, and evidence of infection due to infection or due to any other cause in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>Cochrane Library </I>2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), theTransfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and ongoing trial databases to April 20 2015.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing people receiving granulocyte transfusions to prevent the development of infection with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions. Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, but this review focuses on mortality, mortality due to infection and adverse events.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. One trial is still ongoing, leaving a total of 11 trials eligible involving 653 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2006 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. Ten studies included only adults, and two studies included children and adults. Ten of these studies contained separate data for each arm and were able to be critically appraised. One study re-randomised people and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcome estimates being imprecise.</P>
<P>All-cause mortality was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There was no difference in all-cause mortality over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (seven studies; 437 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Mortality due to infection was reported for seven studies (398 participants). There was no difference in mortality due to infection over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 286 participants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The number of people with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There were differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (test for subgroup differences P = 0.01). There was no difference in the number of people with infections over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the low-dose granulocyte group (&lt; 1.0 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> granulocytes per day) (four studies, 204 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.20; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). There was a decreased number of people with infections over 30 days in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions in the intermediate-dose granulocyte group (1.0 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> to 4.0 x 10<SUP>10 </SUP>granulocytes per day) (4 studies; 293 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>There was a decreased number of participants with bacteraemia and fungaemia in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (nine studies; 609 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65, <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>There was no difference in the number of participants with localised bacterial or fungal infection in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (six studies; 296 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Serious adverse events were only reported for participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and donors of granulocyte transfusions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-14 13:47:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In people who are neutropenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, there is low-grade evidence that prophylactic granulocyte transfusions decrease the risk of bacteraemia or fungaemia. There is low-grade evidence that the effect of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions may be dose-dependent, a dose of at least 1.0 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> per day being more effective at decreasing the risk of infection. There is insufficient evidence to determine any difference in mortality rates due to infection, all-cause mortality, or serious adverse events.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Functioning white blood cells are a vital component of the defence system against infection in humans. There are a variety of different white blood cells that work together and perform complementary roles. Granulocytes are white blood cells that contain granules which are directly visible when viewed through a light microscope. Neutrophils are a subtype of granulocytes and are the most numerous circulating white blood cells in healthy adults. Granulocytes in general and neutrophils in particular are crucial in protecting against bacterial and fungal infection. A persisting reduction in neutrophil numbers is called neutropenia, the severity of which has been classified by the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>): when the peripheral blood count of neutrophils is below a level of 0.5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L there is an increased risk of severe infection (the normal neutrophil count ranges from 2 to 7.5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L in adults). Idiosyncratic neutropenia occurs in the population with a frequency of 120 per million people per year (<LINK REF="REF-van-Staa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Staa 2003</LINK>), but neutropenia is also an inevitable complication of chemotherapy for malignant diseases, as well as a presenting feature of many haematological disorders. Infection in people with neutropenia is associated with hospital admission, organ damage, and a significant number of deaths, despite the use of specific and appropriate antibiotic and antifungal drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2001</LINK>). Even with a normal number of neutrophils, other patients may suffer from a similar inability to fight infections adequately if there is an impairment in the function of their neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Kuijpers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuijpers 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Published reviews have suggested that the efficacy of granulocyte transfusions in neutropenic people is proportional to the dose of granulocytes transfused, with an optimal level being at least 10<SUP>10</SUP> granulocytes or at least 10<SUP>10</SUP> granulocytes per metre squared of recipient body surface area per transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Engelfriet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelfriet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 1996</LINK>). However, there are a number of technical problems that make it difficult to collect adequate granulocyte doses for transfusion. Granulocytes are difficult to separate from other blood cells, and in addition healthy donors do not have very high levels of circulating granulocytes in their peripheral blood. There are a number of different methods for collecting granulocytes for transfusion in humans. Apheresis is a favoured technique utilising equipment incorporating a centrifuge or filter to selectively remove white blood cells from the donor whilst returning other cellular and liquid components to the donor (<LINK REF="REF-Freireich-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freireich 1964</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the early 1990s, growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells (particularly granulocytes) were developed for therapeutic use. These drugs allowed high peripheral blood white cell counts to be achieved in healthy donors. Steroids can also increase the white cell count, but alone they are not as effective as G-CSF. Using this method, adequate doses of granulocytes can be produced for adults. The exposure of a healthy volunteer donor to any form of medication with potential side effects does however present ethical and safety issues (<LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence by laboratory testing that donated granulocytes are functional (<LINK REF="REF-Bashir-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashir 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dale-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1998</LINK>). The ability to collect greater numbers of granulocytes has however generated renewed interest in the potential role of granulocyte transfusions, either as additional therapy for people with neutropenia and established infections or when given as prophylaxis to prevent severe or life-threatening infections (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hubel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Illerhaus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Illerhaus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peters-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Price-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2000</LINK>). These advances have occurred in conjunction with advances in anti-microbial therapy, including antifungal drugs, but the exact relative contributions of these agents in the context of more aggressive chemotherapy regimens and bone marrow transplants remains unclear.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-28 09:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction. Previous Cochrane reviews have been performed with specific reference to neonatal practice and therapeutic granulocyte transfusion in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Pammi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pammi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2005</LINK>). Using granulocyte transfusion as part of a strategy for prevention of infection in neutropenic people may be more effective than therapeutic transfusions in response to established infection. This systematic review would therefore complement the previous Cochrane reviews.</P>
<P>This is an update of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Massey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>One review author (CD) excluded all duplicates and studies that were clearly irrelevant (e.g. non-human) that had been identified by the review search strategy. Two review authors (LE, PB) independently screened all remaining electronically-derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy for relevance. We excluded studies that were clearly irrelevant at this stage based on a review of the abstract. Two review authors (LE, PB) independently formally assessed the full texts of all potentially-relevant trials for eligibility against the criteria outlined above. All disagreements were resolved by discussion without the need for a third review author (SS). We sought further information from study authors if the article contained insufficient data to make a decision about eligibility. A study eligibility form was designed for trials of granulocyte transfusion to help in the assessment of relevance, which included ascertaining whether the participants were neonates, and whether the two groups could be defined in the trial on the basis of a therapeutic-only versus prophylactic granulocyte transfusion strategy. We recorded the reasons why potentially-relevant studies failed to meet the eligibility criteria.</P>

The assessment included information about the design, conduct and analysis of the trial. Each criterion was evaluated on a three-point scale: low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear. To assess risk of bias, the following questions were included in the 'Risk of bias' table for each included study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study Design</HEADING>
<P>There were five single-centre parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>); two single centre quasi-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>); three multicentre parallel RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>) and one parallel RCT where the number of centres was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study Size</HEADING>
<P>The number of participants enrolled in all studies was small, ranging between 18 (<LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>) and 225 (<LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>) participants analysed. Most of the studies presented no or little information on sample sizes required to power the trial around a main outcome, and only one study made any attempt to justify the statistical analysis of the required size (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>). All other trials should probably be considered more as hypothesis generating in respect of design.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Setting</HEADING>
<P>The nine RCTs were published between 1978 and 1987 (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>), the two quasi-randomised studies were published between 2003 and 2006 (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The majority of participants were people with haematological malignancies receiving intensive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HMST). Most studies included only adults. Two studies included children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Average dose and range</HEADING>
<P>The dose of granulocytes transfused varied between studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The mean dose varied from 0.6 x 10<SUP>10 </SUP>(<LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>) to 5.9 x 10<SUP>10 </SUP>(<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Schedule for transfusion</HEADING>
<P>Granulocyte transfusions were commenced when the recipient's neutrophil count fell below a pre-defined value in eight of the 11 studies. This "trigger" neutrophil count was 0.2 x 10<SUP>9 </SUP>/L for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>), and 0.5 x10<SUP>9</SUP> /L for six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>). In the Schiffer study, the granulocyte component contained a significant number of platelets and was therefore commenced if the patient needed platelet transfusion, even if the defined neutrophil count trigger had not been met <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>.</P>
<P>The other three studies started granulocyte transfusions at pre-specified time points after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Once prophylactic granulocyte transfusions had commenced, daily transfusions were given in seven of the 11 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Granulocyte transfusions were given on alternate days by one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>), and for four days out of seven by one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>). Two studies gave granulocyte transfusions on two occasions at fixed time points after HSCT (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Granulocyte transfusions were discontinued when the recipient's neutrophil count rose above a pre-defined value in eight of the 11 studies. This "trigger" neutrophil count was 0.2 x 10<SUP>9 </SUP>/L for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>), and 0.5 x10<SUP>9</SUP> /L for six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>). Mannoni gave transfusions for a set period of 12 days but continued for 15 days in one case as there was evidence of infection at 12 days (<LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>). Two studies gave granulocyte transfusions on two occasions at fixed time points after HSCT (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Method of collection of granulocytes</HEADING>
<P>The method of collection of granulocytes varied between trials. Nine studies used either intermittent or continuous flow centrifugation (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>). One study used both filtration leucapheresis and continuous flow centrifugation (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>). One study only used filtration leucapheresis (<LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>). Methods of collection have developed considerably since these publications. Filtration leucapheresis is rarely used now, as despite possibly higher yields compared to continuous flow centrifugation, there are concerns about toxicity to the donor and recipient, in addition to evidence of poor increments and functionality of transfused granulocytes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Premedication of donors</HEADING>
<P>Four studies did not administer any form of medication to the donors to increase the granulocyte yield (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies gave donors steroids, either dexamethasone, hydrocortisone or prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies gave donors G-CSF (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Donor selection</HEADING>
<P>Human leucocyte (HLA)-matched and ABO matched the granulocyte donor in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>); one study ensured that donor and recipient were HLA and ABO compatible (<LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>). One study stated that family members were used as granulocyte donors and the HLA-matched sibling donor was used whenever possible (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies used serological compatibility based upon leucocyte crossmatch (rather than HLA matching) (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>), in which donor leucocytes were crossmatched against recipient serum/plasma by lymphocytotoxic (LCT) techniques prior to transfusion, and donors were ABO and Rh compatible.</P>
<P>Four studies did not HLA-match the granulocyte donor (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK> discontinued unmatched transfusions if transfusion reactions or refractoriness to platelet transfusions occurred, at which point HLA-matched donors were used if available. One study did not report whether any assessment of leucocyte compatibility was assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Co-interventions and/or alternative interventions</HEADING>
<P>Differences between the studies were also identified in the co-interventions provided to participants. Specifically, this would include the diagnostic and therapeutic options available for anti-microbial practice.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>) had an important difference in that there was an alternative intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK> randomised participants between two study arms. One arm received prophylactic granulocyte transfusions, the other arm received prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin 2 g/24 hours, ticarcillin 300 mg/kg/24 hours (cefotaxime if allergic) and tobramycin 5 mg/kg/24 hours) (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies gave prophylactic antibiotics to all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>). Three studies did not give prophylactic antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>).

<P>Five studies defined the empirical antibiotic treatment to be given if a patient had a febrile episode (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Definition of infection (used to recruit uninfected people or identify those who became infected)</HEADING>
<P>Studies also applied different criteria for definition of infection although defined in all studies on the basis of temperature, clinical signs and isolation of organisms.</P>
<P>Seven studies stated that patients with infections were excluded from the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Villagran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Villagran 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannoni-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mannoni 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffer-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffer 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1980</LINK>); the specific exclusion definitions varied (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies did not specifically state whether infected patients were excluded from the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>), and in the <LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK> study it is clear in the analysis that some patients were on systemic antibiotics at enrolment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Although few studies examined exactly the same range of outcomes, most trials reported mortality and survival (at different time points), information on fever (or days with fever), and information on episodes of infection (however defined), together with a measure of antibiotic use.

<P>This Cochrane review aimed to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions. This review should be read in conjunction with another review undertaken to evaluate the randomised trial evidence base for the use of therapeutic granulocyte transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified 12 randomised and quasi-randomised trials that met our inclusion criteria; one of which is still ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01204788" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01204788</LINK>). Eleven trials were included in this review containing a total of 653 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2006 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. Ten of these studies contained separate data for each arm and were able to be critically appraised. One study re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed.</P>
<P>The findings of the review led to the following main conclusions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not. This was measured over 30 days in seven studies (437 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36).</LI>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in mortality due to infection between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not. This was measured over 30 days in six studies (286 participants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44).</LI>
<LI>There were differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (test for subgroup differences P = 0.01) in the number of people with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections. There was no difference in the number of people with infections in the low-dose granulocyte group (&lt; 1.0 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> granulocytes per day) between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (four studies, 204 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.20). There was a decreased number of people with infections over 30 days in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions in the intermediate-dose granulocyte group (1.0 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> to 4.0 x 10<SUP>10 </SUP>granulocytes per day) (4 studies; 293 participants; RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63). There was a decreased number of people with bacteraemia and fungaemia in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (nine studies; 609 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65). There was no difference in the number of people with localised bacterial or fungal infection in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (six studies; 296 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14).</LI>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the number of serious adverse events between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not. This was because serious adverse events were only reported for people receiving granulocyte transfusions and donors of granulocyte transfusions.</LI>
<LI>There was no obvious trend in the number of days with fever, or number of days with antibiotics between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not.</LI>
<LI>None of the studies reported the duration of neutropenia reversal.</LI>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides the most up-to-date assessment of the effectiveness and safety of a prophylactic granulocyte transfusion policy compared with not administering prophylactic granulocyte transfusions. This updated review identified one additional quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>). This review provides some low-quality evidence that prophylactic granulocytes decrease the risk of developing a bacterial or fungal infection.</P>
<P>However, the results of this review should not be interpreted without considering the impact of the following factors.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The studies included in this review range over a 28-year period (1978 to 2006) during which chemotherapy protocols, predicted survival rates, supportive care, including antibiotics and antifungal medication, have changed substantially. Newer less toxic antifungal drug options are now available.</LI>
<LI>None of the studies reported on quality control measures operating for blood components, including granulocytes, and current blood components may be manufactured to a higher specification than in the time period of these studies.</LI>
<LI>Only two of the studies gave granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to the granulocyte donors (<LINK REF="STD-Oza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oza 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vij-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vij 2003</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>None of the studies assessed the use of granulocytes derived from whole blood donations (<LINK REF="REF-Bashir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashir 2008</LINK>). This component has been assessed in a small safety study (<LINK REF="REF-Massey-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 2012</LINK>). The process of obtaining granulocyte collections from directed G-CSF and/or steroid-stimulated donors who are 'family and friends' of patients or unrelated donors involves multiple steps. It is important that family and 'friends' of patients are given time and adequate explanation of the small risks to which they are exposed by both taking specific drugs (steroids or G-CSF, or both) to mobilise granulocytes into the peripheral blood and by undergoing an apheresis procedure. To date, most of these risks have been theoretical or weak associations only but posterior capsular cataracts, splenic rupture and venous thrombosis have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghodsi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghodsi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutierrez 2001</LINK>). There are also a number of potentially important constraints that can limit provision of apheresis products on a regular and timely basis; e.g. hospitals in Europe managing granulocyte collections by apheresis now have a requirement for meeting 'blood establishment status' according to EU legislation.</LI>
<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>), compared prophylactic granulocyte transfusions with prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics. Data from this study were only incorporated into meta-analyses for two outcomes, people with bacteraemia of fungaemia and people with localised bacterial or fungal infection. There was no significant difference to the overall analysis when results from this study were excluded.</LI>
<LI>Not all end points from the studies could be analysed due to varying methods of reporting the outcomes. This was true for: numbers of days with fever; number of days on treatment with antimicrobials (or courses of treatment with antibiotics/antifungals); and increment of neutrophil count (x10<SUP>9</SUP>/L).</LI>
<LI>In three of the studies many of the participants enrolled were not included in the final analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Clift-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Clift 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>). Between 16% (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1987</LINK>) and 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1982</LINK>) of participants were randomised but not included within the analysis.</LI>

</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcome estimates being imprecise.</P>
<P>Two outcomes were considered low-grade quality evidence according to GRADE methodology due to the very serious risk of bias of the included studies.</P>
<UL>
<LI>People with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections - Intermediate-dose granulocyte transfusions.</LI>
<LI>People with bacteraemia or fungaemia.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This was because of: a high risk of selection bias because two studies were quasi-randomised; a high risk of attrition bias because three studies did not include a significant proportion of randomised people in the analysis; and a high risk of performance bias and detection bias due to the nature of the intervention (granulocyte transfusion) and difficulty blinding participants, physicians and outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Four outcomes were considered very low-grade quality evidence according to GRADE methodology due to the very serious risk of bias of the included studies (see above) and the serious imprecision of the estimates.</P>
<UL>
<LI>All-cause mortality.</LI>
<LI>Mortality due to infection.</LI>
<LI>People with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections - low-dose granulocyte transfusions.</LI>
<LI>People with localised bacterial or fungal infection.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The reason for the imprecision is because of the small number of participants within the trials and the low number of events. For example, if we assume an all-cause mortality rate of 14.5% (overall rate within the included studies within this review up to 30 days), we need a sample size of approximately 15,000 participants to be able to detect with 90% power the ability to save two extra lives per 100 people within a 30-day period.</P>
<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> for visual representations of the assessments of risk of bias across all studies and for each item in the individual studies.</P>

<P>To our knowledge, our review process is free from bias. We conducted a comprehensive search; searching data sources (including multiple databases, and clinical trial registries) to ensure that all relevant trials would be captured. There were no restrictions for the language in which the paper was originally published. The relevance of each paper was carefully assessed and all screening and data extractions were performed in duplicate. We pre-specified all outcomes and subgroups prior to analysis. There were insufficient numbers of included studies within the meta-analyses for us to use a funnel plot to examine the risk of publication bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review has identified low-quality evidence that prophylactic granulocyte transfusion lead to a reduction in the number of people developing a bacterial or fungal infection, especially if the dose is at least 1.0 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> per day. It would however, be premature to conclude that the use of granulocytes as prophylaxis in people with neutropenia would improve outcomes and prove cost-effective as the potential harms of the intervention could not be fully assessed. Supportive therapy in this setting has changed since most of the reviewed studies were performed. None of the studies in this review specifically evaluated people with congenital disorders of neutrophil function or production. None of the studies in this review assessed the use of blood product-derived granulocytes. In keeping with the conclusions from the systematic review of the use of granulocyte transfusions for therapeutic indications, the use of granulocyte transfusions should still be regarded as investigational and should ideally be conducted in the context of ongoing prospective trials designed to answer the question of effectiveness.<BR/>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-24 12:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Contemporary well-designed prospective trials of sufficient power are required to evaluate the effectiveness of granulocyte transfusions as prophylaxis. The design of trials needs to consider multiple factors. Most importantly, the power calculations should be based upon the outcome measures currently encountered with standard therapy in the population selected. If mortality rate is to be used as an outcome measure that may be improved by granulocyte transfusion then populations with a higher mortality rate may be more amenable to show evidence of benefit.</P>
<P>All systematic reviews performed to date have suggested that the dose transfused is important although the exact minimal effective dose remains uncertain. Such a dose could be consistently obtained by secondary processing of "buffy coat" granulocytes or by administering G-CSF and steroids to ABO-compatible apheresis donors. The schedule for administration of granulocyte transfusions in the identified studies varied considerably, and would need to be standardised. However, the frequency of transfusion is to a major part also governed by logistical issues and therefore it is likely that the schedule will continue to be dictated by availability of donors and facilities.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> Owing to the nature of the intervention (granulocyte transfusion) and difficulty blinding participants, physicians and outcome assessors studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. We downgraded the evidence by 1 for risk of bias<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Two studies were biologically randomised and therefore at high risk of selection bias. Three studies did not include a significant proportion of people who were randomised within the analysis and are at high risk of attrition bias<BR/>
