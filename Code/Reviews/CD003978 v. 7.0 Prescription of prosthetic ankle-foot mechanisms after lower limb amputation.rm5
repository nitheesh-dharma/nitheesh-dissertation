<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is not enough evidence to establish precise criteria for the prescription of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms in individuals with a lower limb amputation.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>There are many different prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms available. When prescribing a prosthesis, the goal is to help individuals with a lower limb amputation return to their place in society, participating in activities that are important to them. This means finding a prosthesis that is appropriate for their level of activity, ability and weight. </P>
<P>In high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation, there is limited evidence for the superiority of the Flex foot during level walking compared with the solid-ankle cushioned heel (SACH) foot in respect of energy cost and, gait efficiency. This benefit has only been confirmed in individuals with a transtibial amputation during decline and incline walking and increased walking speeds. In prescribing prosthetic-ankle foot mechanisms for individuals with a lower limb amputation, practitioners should take into account availability, patient functional needs, the type of knee mechanism to be prescribed and the inter-relationship with ankle-foot mechanisms, and cost.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A prosthesis can be divided into several components: the prosthetic socket; the prosthetic ankle-foot mechanism; and for higher levels of amputation, the prosthetic knee. This review focuses on the prosthetic ankle-foot mechanism, which forms an important part of the prosthesis in terms of mobility. A correct prosthetic prescription can be derived by matching the functional abilities of the individual with a lower limb amputation with the technical and functional aspects of the various prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms. However, there seems to be no clear clinical consensus on the precise prescription criteria for the various prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms in relation to the functional abilities of individuals with a lower limb amputation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To obtain information about aspects of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms and daily functioning of individuals with a lower limb prosthesis, for appropriate prosthetic prescription criteria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2006), EMBASE (1983 to April 2006), CINAHL (1982 to April 2006), AMED (Allied and Complimentary Medicine) (1985 to April 2006), and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different ankle foot mechanisms for lower limb amputation in adults. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently identified potential articles from the literature search. Methodological quality was assessed using a checklist comprising 13 criteria. The reviewers extracted data using pre-defined extraction forms. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-six trials were included, with a total of 245 participants. The numbers of participants in the included trials ranged from three to sixteen. The methodological quality was moderate. Only one study was of high quality. All included studies used cross-over designs allowing sufficient control for confounding. </P>
<P>In individuals with a transtibial amputation, there seems to be a small tendency towards a greater stride length when walking with the Flex-foot in comparison to the SACH (solid-ankle cushioned heel) foot. When walking speed was increased, the energy cost was lower. In high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation, there is limited evidence for the superiority of the Flex foot during level walking compared with the SACH foot in respect of energy cost and gait efficiency.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from high quality comparative studies for the overall superiority of any individual type of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanism, although there is a small trend towards the Flex-foot in comparison with the SACH foot for greater stride length and lower energy cost in individuals with a transtibial amputation, and improved gait efficiency and lower energy cost in high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation. In prescribing prosthetic-ankle foot mechanisms for individuals with a lower limb amputation, practitioners should take into account availability, patient functional needs, the type of knee mechanism to be prescribed and the inter-relationship with ankle-foot mechanisms, and cost.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-12 17:29:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Prosthetic prescription for individuals with a lower limb amputation is primarily based on empirical knowledge. Many options are available for different prosthetic components; however, prescription criteria are based mainly on subjective experiences of physicians, therapists, and prosthetists (<LINK REF="STD-Goh-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Menard 1992</LINK>). On the other hand, third-party payers frequently require justification for purchasing costly prostheses (<LINK REF="STD-Menard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Menard 1992</LINK>). Also, clarity for the customer is required since quality of care is becoming more important.</P>
<P>In the ideal situation, prosthetic prescription is based on adjusting the mechanical characteristics of a prosthesis to the functional needs of the prosthesis user (<LINK REF="STD-Cortes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 1997</LINK>), yet no clinical guidelines seem to be available for this use. The development of scientifically based clinical guidelines is a way of making health care more consistent and efficient and diminishes the gap between what clinicians do and what scientific evidence supports. A systematic literature review is the first step in clinical guideline development. It may also highlight knowledge gaps in the existing evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Woolf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>To our knowledge, no scientifically based guidelines for lower-limb prosthetic prescription exist. Also, no consensus seems to exist among different professionals with regard to the criteria for selecting prosthetic components related to the functional abilities and needs of patients. In this perspective, we have decided to develop clinical guidelines for lower limb prosthetic prescription in order to obtain transparency and consensus among clinicians, manufacturers and insurance companies. The first step is to obtain explicit knowledge from the literature. For this purpose, the types of studies we are interested in are studies addressing motor performance and/or daily functioning of individuals with a lower limb amputation. These studies focus on subjective findings, energy expenditure, or gait parameters. In view of clinical guideline development these studies are considered most relevant for prosthetic prescription. Hence, this review will be restricted to these clinically oriented studies.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to obtain information about aspects of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms and daily functioning of adult individuals with a lower limb amputation. This information should provide an objective starting point for further development of consensus-based criteria for prosthetic prescription.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-12 17:29:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different prosthetic devices for lower limb amputation in adults.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All adult (18-80 years of age) transfemoral, through-knee, and transtibial individuals with dysvascular, traumatic, congenital, or oncologic amputations. Because amputation levels other than these require individual prescription, these amputation levels (e.g. hip disarticulation or toe amputations) are not included in this review. There were no race or gender restrictions, or restrictions on setting. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any trials which compare the ankle-foot mechanisms currently in use such as SACH-feet, Flex-feet, Seattle-feet, Single-Axis feet. Trials investigating amputation techniques or early prosthetic fitting (i.e. use of a temporary prosthesis prior to the permanent prosthesis) were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Motor performance and activities of daily living (ADL) functioning are important for prosthetic prescription, therefore data were sought for the following outcome measures:<BR/>1. Subjective findings: preference, satisfaction, Borg-scale, ease of walking, outcome of questionnaires (Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire, Prosthetic Profile of the Amputee, Locomotor Capabilities Index, Sickness Impact Profile, Nottingham Health Profile, Reintegration to Normal Living)<BR/>2. Energy expenditure: oxygen consumption, heart rate<BR/>3. Stride characteristics: walking speed, walking distance, stride length, step length, stride time, cadence, stance phase duration, swing phase duration<BR/>4. Kinetic parameters: ground reaction force<BR/>5. Kinematic parameters: joint motion (ankle dorsiflexion, ankle plantar flexion, knee flexion and extension, hip flexion and extension)</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-12 17:29:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all studies identified by the initial search and excluded non-relevant studies. Full text articles were obtained for any studies with unclear methodology or when abstracts were not available. Disagreement on inclusion was resolved by consulting a third reviewer. Full text articles were obtained for any studies which passed the inclusion criteria as described above.</P>
<P>
<B>Study quality</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality was assessed using a checklist comprising 13 criteria. This checklist was based on two existing criteria lists for quality assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tulder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>), which were originally developed to evaluate randomised controlled trials. Each criterion was scored according to three levels: no = '0', yes = '1' or not applicable = 'NA'. The selected studies were analysed by two review authors and differences resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of patients</B>
<BR/>A1: Adequacy of description of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This criterion tested whether the patient sample was sufficiently defined using selection criteria. At least three of the following descriptives were required: age, level of amputation, reason for amputation, activity level of the participant, time since onset, stump condition, comorbidity, and sex.<BR/>A2: Homogeneity. The homogeneity of the study sample was assessed, in relation to activity level, age and reason for amputation. For the purpose of this review, the activity level of the investigated participants should be similar. In case the activity level of the individuals with a lower limb amputation was not described, at least an indication of the level of amputation, the reason for amputation, and the age of the participants was required to assess the activity level of the individuals with a lower limb amputation. If the study sample was a heterogeneous population, an adequate stratification of the outcome parameters was required.<BR/>A3: Prognostic comparability. In the case of a within-subject design, groups are comparable at baseline by definition. The participants studied should be comparable for possible confounding factors such as time since amputation, time since first walking with the prosthesis, unilateral amputation, prosthesis experience, stump condition (completely healed stump, residual limb stump volume, good shaped stump free from skin problems, suture defects or hypertrophic scars, no residual limb pain, swelling or pressure sores), sound limb condition, physical condition (not suffering from any concurrent illness, no history of lower extremity joint dysfunction of the non-amputated leg, no concurrent painful conditions that might affect the gait pattern, no major gait deviations, an associated handicap that might restrict walking ability, the need to use technical aids (walking sticks), intercurrent medical problems liable to modify respiratory gaseous exchanges, addiction to tobacco, presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, peripheral or central neurological disease affecting walking, lower-limb articular or pre-articular damage liable to cause walking-restricting pains, no coexisting neurologic or musculoskeletal disorders that interfere with walking).<BR/>A4: Randomisation. In randomised controlled studies, an adequate randomisation procedure should have been followed. If the randomisation procedure was described and the procedure would exclude bias, this criterion was scored as '2'. In within-subject designs, the internal validity does not depend on the randomisation as in randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Piantadosi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piantadosi 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>
<BR/>B5: Experimental intervention. The measurements of the experimental intervention should be given explicitly in such detail that it is possible to perform a duplicate study as described.<BR/>B6: Co-interventions. This criterion tested whether co-interventions were avoided or that co-interventions were comparable in the study groups.<BR/>B7: Blinding. The outcome assessor had to be blinded to the intervention. In most studies investigating prosthetic components, it is impossible to blind the patients.<BR/>B8: Timing of the measurement. This criterion pertained to the moment that the study was performed in relation to the time participants were able to adapt to the intervention. An adequate adaptation period was required.<BR/>B9: Outcome measures. The outcome variables should be adequate in relation to the purpose of the study and they should have been applied with a standardised protocol.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical validity</B>
<BR/>C10: Drop-outs. The number of drop-outs and the reason for drop-outs had to be sufficiently reported. A drop-out rate of more than 20 per cent was considered unacceptable.<BR/>C11: Sample size. The sample size (n) in relation to the number of independent variables (K) was adequate if the ratio n:K exceeded 10:1.<BR/>C12: Intention-to-treat. Intention-to-treat analysis should be assessed in the case of drop-outs.<BR/>C13: Data presentation. This criterion required that point estimates and measures of variability were presented for the primary outcome measures.</P>
<P>
<B>Best-evidence synthesis</B>
<BR/>In relation to the purpose of our review, it was required that the included studies should control for selection bias and measurement bias. Therefore, only the studies in which the total score of the A criteria and B criteria was six points or more (out of a possible nine points) were used in the best-evidence synthesis. Studies were classified as A if the total score of all criteria was 11 points or more, and included a positive score for blinded outcome assessment (criterion B7) and timing of the measurement (criterion B8). Studies were classified as B if the total score was between six and 10 points, including a positive score for timing of the measurement (criterion B8). Studies were classified C studies if the total score of the A criteria and B criteria was at least than six points, but with an invalid score on the criteria B7 and B8.</P>
<P>
<B>In summary</B>
<BR/>A grade: 11 points or more, including six points out of the A and B criteria, which must include B7 and B8;<BR/>B grade: between six and 10 points, including six points out of the A and B criteria, which must include B8;<BR/>C grade: Studies with a total score of at least 6 points out of the A and B criteria with an invalid score on the criteria B7 and B8.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted from all relevant studies independently by two reviewers (HL, CH) and entered into RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where possible and necessary, attempts were made to secure missing data from the authors.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Due to the study design of the included studies it was impossible to attempt to pool the results of the included studies in this review, due to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The study populations of all the different trials were heterogeneous, because of the difference in the level of amputation, the cause of amputation, and activity level of the individuals with a lower limb amputation</LI>
<LI>There were a lot of different interventions; in 26 trials 19 prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms were investigated</LI>
<LI>There were a lot of different outcome parameters, measured in different ways.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Therefore, the data were not pooled but the results of the individual studies were reported in their groups of outcome parameters.</P>

<BR/>
<I>Participants<BR/>
</I>The numbers of participants in the included trials ranged from 3 to 16. In most studies, participants wore prostheses that allowed interchange of the foot component. The numbers of participants in the included trials ranged from three to sixteen. The participants' lower extremity was amputated for vascular, traumatic or oncological reason. Exclusion of participants with stump problems was reported in 12 studies.</P>

<P>On the whole, the methodological quality of the included studies was moderate with the majority of the studies attaining an overall grade of B. Of a total possible quality score of 14, the range of the overall scores was 7 to 13, with a mean score of 9. The methodological quality scores are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. </P>
<P>In three studies it was unclear if the participants had a similar activity level. In two studies the reason for amputation was diverse (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Culham-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Culham 1984</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-Doane-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Doane 1983</LINK>, the reason for amputation was not reported. In sixteen studies, the sequence of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms was randomised; of these, only <LINK REF="STD-Postema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Postema 1994</LINK> described which randomisation procedure was applied. In most studies, participants wore prostheses that allowed interchange of the foot component, therefore these studies scored '1' for the B6-criterion co-interventions. However, four studies did not report any detail of the prosthetic components of the participants, followed by a '0' score on this criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Underwood-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Underwood 2004</LINK>). Only one study reported blinding of the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Postema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Postema 1994</LINK>). Treatment masking or blinding is an effective way to increase the objectivity of the person(s) observing experimental outcomes. When the treatments are masked, the bias of the participants and observer are not likely to influence the measurements taken.</P>
<P>It is assumed that individuals with a lower limb amputation would need a period of at least one week to acclimatise to prosthetic feet (<LINK REF="REF-English-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">English 1995</LINK>). This was not the case or not reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goh-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Underwood-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Underwood 2004</LINK>). If a participant did not acclimatise to a new prosthetic foot, one could not be sure that pertinent gait parameters would have been stabilised. Nine studies failed to mention the number of drop-outs and in the tables or figures it was not clear whether all the participants were able to perform all the tests (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doane-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Doane 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goh-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marinakis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marinakis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Powers 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torburn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Torburn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Underwood-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Underwood 2004</LINK>). The number of participants was very low in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Barth-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1992</LINK>, two subgroups were investigated; each subgroup consisted of only three participants. The population of <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK> also consisted of only three participants. The criteria 'intention-to-treat' was not applicable for any of the included studies, since there were no drop-outs, or the number and reason for drop-outs was not mentioned. </P>
<P>Data were not presented sufficiently in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cortes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goh-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Menard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cortes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cortes 1997</LINK> investigated which factors influence the individual's gait and in which order of importance. The results did not show the effect of different prosthetic feet on the assessed outcome parameters in terms of mean and standard deviation. Therefore the results of this study cannot be included in the comparison. <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1997</LINK> presented the data as a percentage of healthy non-amputated controls. However, the normative values were based on unpublished laboratory data.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>With the exception of the Borg-scale, the outcome parameters included in this section were measured while the participants were walking at their comfortable velocity, otherwise the data would not be comparable. All included trials concern transtibial amputations, except for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacFarlane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacFarlane 1997</LINK>). For all parameters in this section, the results will firstly be described for the transtibial amputations and subsequently for the transfemoral (<LINK REF="STD-MacFarlane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacFarlane 1997</LINK>) or the transgenual amputations (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstra 1993</LINK>), if applicable. <BR/> <BR/>
<B>1. Comfortable walking velocity (meters per minute)</B>
<BR/>Seventeen studies used comfortable walking velocity as an outcome parameter. Only two studies reported significant differences between some prosthetic feet (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1995</LINK>). The individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation in Nielsen's study walked faster with the Flex-foot than the SACH-foot (77.8±16.9m/min versus 71.4±15.8m/min) and individuals with diabetic transtibial amputation in Snyder's study reached a higher self-selected walking velocity with the Flex-foot than the SACH-foot (71.6±12.6m/min versus 63.6 ±10.0m/min). </P>
<P>
<B>2. Stride length (meters)</B>
<BR/>Ten studies used stride length as an outcome parameter. Only two studies found significant differences between the Flex foot and other prosthetic feet. The individuals with traumatic transtibial amputation in <LINK REF="STD-Powers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Powers 1994</LINK> had a greater stride length when walking with the Flex-foot than with the SACH and the Quantum foot (1.50±0.13m, vs. 1.44±0.15m and 1.44±0.15m). The individuals with diabetic transtibial amputation in Snyder's study also had a greater stride length when walking with the Flex-foot, compared to the SACH, the Carbon Copy II and the Seattle foot (1.35±0.19m vs. 1.25±0.16m, 1.27±0.17m, and 1.25±0.13m) (<LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1995</LINK>). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>3. Cadence (steps per minute)</B>
<BR/>Nine studies used cadence as an outcome parameter. None of the studies showed differences in cadence between the several prosthetic feet, while walking at comfortable walking velocity. </P>
<P>
<B>4. Energy cost (ml oxygen per kg per minute)<BR/>
</B>Ten studies used energy cost as an outcome parameter. No significant differences were found in energy cost among the prosthetic feet tested in the traumatic as well as the vascular group in <LINK REF="STD-Barth-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1992</LINK>. Both the vascular and traumatic group in Huang's study also showed no differences in energy cost when walking with the SACH-foot, single axis, or the multiple axis (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2000</LINK>). For the five individuals with transtibial amputation of Torburn's study there were no differences between foot-types in energy cost during free walk (<LINK REF="STD-Torburn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Torburn 1990</LINK>). This was also the case for the nine traumatic and the seven vascular individuals with a transtibial amputation in <LINK REF="STD-Torburn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Torburn 1995</LINK>.</P>
<P>Energy cost was identical for the two prosthetic feet as well as for the traumatic and the vascular transtibial amputation group of Casillas' study when walking on level ground at self selected walking speed (<LINK REF="STD-Casillas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Casillas 1995</LINK>). While walking on a level treadmill at a progressive speed, the energy cost was lower with the prototype foot compared to the SACH foot in the traumatic group and the difference became more significant as speed increased (22.11±3.29 ml oxygen/kg/min vs. 24.71±2.18 at 6 km/h). Energy cost was also lower when walking with the Proteor foot compared with the SACH foot with inclined and declined treadmill walking (16.79±2.32 vs. 19.31±2.80 ml oxygen/kg/min with a 5% decline on the treadmill). When the individuals with a nonvascular transtibial amputation in Hsu's study walked on the treadmill, energy cost was significantly decreased while walking with the Re-Flex VSP compared with the SACH and the Flex foot at progressive speed (36.83±5.07 ml oxygen/kg/min vs. 40.73±5.29 and 39.44±5 .37 when running at 147.51m/min), while the Flex-foot and the SACH were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>For the eight individuals with a transtibial traumatic amputation in Schmalz' study, the values of the energy cost showed no significant differences between the various foot designs when walking at 4km/h. However, energy consumption increased when walking with the 1S71 SACH-foot at a speed of 4.8km/h compared to the other feet (16.1± 1.4 vs. 15.6±1.2 ml oxygen/kg/min) (<LINK REF="STD-Schmalz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalz 2002</LINK>). At walking speeds of 2.5 miles per hour, the energy cost of walking with the SACH-foot was higher than with the Flex-foot in the three individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation in <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>. However, no means and standard deviations of this outcome parameter were presented. </P>
<P>For the eight individuals with a transtibial traumatic amputation in Hsu's study it appeared that the energy expenditure of the Flex-foot was slightly less than that of the SACH-foot, and the differences between the Flex-foot and the SACH-foot appeared to progressively increase with increases in walking speed (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2006</LINK>). The C-walk appeared to have lower oxygen consumption values at 67.05 and 80.46m/min when compared with the Flex-foot. However, the differences between the foot-types in this study were not significant. </P>
<P>In MacFarlane's study, five individuals with a traumatic transfemoral amputation walked with a lower energy cost when walking with the Flex-foot than with the SACH-foot (16.70±0.24 vs. 17.69±0.24 ml oxygen/kg/min) (<LINK REF="STD-MacFarlane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacFarlane 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>5. Gait efficiency (ml oxygen per kg per meter)</B>
<BR/>Nine studies used gait efficiency as an outcome parameter. Gait efficiency was lower with the Proteor foot compared with the SACH-foot for the twelve individuals with a traumatic amputation in <LINK REF="STD-Casillas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Casillas 1995</LINK> (0.22±0.04 vs. 0.24±0.04 ml oxygen/kg/meter). Between foot-type comparisons showed progressive separation of the energy cost values (SACH&gt;Flex-foot&gt;Re-Flex VSP) with increasing walking speed. The differences appeared negligible for the lower two walking speeds. <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 1999</LINK> found that foot-type comparisons for the subjects showed progressive separation of the gait efficiency values (SACH&gt;Flex-foot&gt;Re-Flex VSP) with increasing walking speed (between 53.64 m/min and 147.51 m/min). The gait-efficiency of the Re-Flex VSP was significantly different compared with the SACH and the Flex-foot (0.28±0.04 vs. 0.25±0.03 ml oxygen/kg/m at a running speed of 147.51 m/min); the differences between the SACH-foot and the Flex-foot were not significantly different (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>For each walking and running speed in <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993a</LINK>, there were no significant differences among the three foot designs for the nine individuals with a transtibial amputation. The same results were found in another study of Lehmann (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993b</LINK>), while walking with the Seattle and the Flex-foot. </P>
<P>For the three individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation of Nielsen's study there were no significant differences in gait efficiency between the two types of prosthetic feet at all walking speeds (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1988</LINK>). For the eight individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation of Hsu's study the C-walk and the Flex-foot appeared to be more efficient compared with the SACH across all tested walking speeds, and with greater differences between the C-walk and the SACH-foot at mid-range speeds (67.05 and 80.46m/min), with greater differences between the Flex-foot and the SACH-foot at higher walking speeds (93.87 and 107.28m/min) (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2006</LINK>). However, these results were not significant. </P>
<P>For the five individuals with a transtibial amputation of Torburn's study there were no differences between foot-types in gait efficiency during free walk (<LINK REF="STD-Torburn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Torburn 1990</LINK>). This was also the case for the nine individuals with traumatic and seven individuals with vascular transtibial amputation in <LINK REF="STD-Torburn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Torburn 1995</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacFarlane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacFarlane 1997</LINK> found that the mean walking efficiency was better (lower value) at each walking speed with the Flex-foot than with the SACH-foot (0.253±0.003 ml oxygen/kg/meter vs 0.270±0.003) in five individuals with a traumatic transfemoral amputation. </P>
<P>
<B>6. Borg-Scale </B>
<BR/>One study used the Borg-scale as an outcome parameter. In MacFarlane's study, walking with the SACH-foot was perceived to be more difficult with each grade and speed condition than walking with the Flex-foot (10.4±1.6 vs. 8.6±1.1 at level walking at medium speed) (<LINK REF="STD-MacFarlane-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MacFarlane 1991</LINK>). The greatest difference occurred on the level and incline grades. </P>
<P>As for patient satisfaction, the only A study (<LINK REF="STD-Postema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Postema 1994</LINK>) concluded that no specific prosthetic foot was consistently favoured over another type of foot by individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation. Yet, in one B study, the prototype energy-storing foot (Proteor foot) scored a higher satisfaction rate than the SACH foot in individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation (<LINK REF="STD-Casillas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Casillas 1995</LINK>). In one C-study the Flex foot was preferred over the SAFE foot for perceived stability and mobility, although no statistical analysis was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Underwood-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Underwood 2004</LINK>). However, since the prosthetic users were not blinded in MacFarlane's, Casillas' and Underwood's studies, these results should be interpreted with caution. </P>
<P>
<B>Joint motion</B>
<BR/>Ten studies used joint motion as an outcome parameter. In <LINK REF="STD-Postema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Postema 1994</LINK>, the range of motion (ROM) at the ankle during the stance phase of a single-axis conventional foot was greater than the same ROM of two energy-storing feet. This result could readily be related to the mechanical characteristics of the different feet i.e. the presence or absence of an ankle axis in the frontal plane. Furthermore, the energy storing Flex foot showed a greater late stance dorsiflexion compared with the conventional SACH foot in three B studies (<LINK REF="STD-Powers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Powers 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torburn-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Torburn 1990</LINK>) and two C studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalz 2002</LINK>) on individuals with traumatic and vascular transtibial amputation. The fact that the Flex foot resulted in a greater stride-length is indicative of a greater tibial advancement as a result of increased dorsiflexion (<LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Marinakis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marinakis 2004</LINK> studied the ROM of the hip, knee and ankle joints of nine individuals with a traumatic transtibial amputation. With the SACH-foot, the ankle joint was continuously at a low-angle dorsiflexion, reaching a maximum of 3.0 degrees. With the Greissinger plus foot, the maximum dorsiflexion was 6.5 degrees, and the maximum plantar flexion 11 degrees, resulting in an ROM within the lower limits of the range of values observed during measurements with the non-disabled subjects.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>None of the included studies showed significant differences between any of the investigated prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms for the comfortable walking speed or cadence. However, In individuals with a transtibial amputation, there seems to be a slight trend towards a greater stride length when walking with the Flex-foot in comparison to the SACH foot (<LINK REF="STD-Powers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Powers 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>During level treadmill walking there were no differences in energy cost in either the individuals with a traumatic or vascular transtibial amputations. However, when walking speed was increased or when subjects walked on a decline or incline treadmill, the energy cost was lower when walking with an energy-storing foot than with the SACH foot (<LINK REF="STD-Casillas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Casillas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalz 2002</LINK>). These studies indicate that the individual with a transtibial amputation who is active and is able to walk on inclines and declines could benefit from an energy-storing prosthetic foot, such as the Flex-foot, the Re-Flex foot or the Proteor foot. </P>
<P>In contrast, the energy cost is lower during level walking when walking with the Flex-foot compared with the SACH-foot in individuals with a transfemoral amputation (<LINK REF="STD-MacFarlane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">MacFarlane 1997</LINK>). This raises the hypothesis that in high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation, the design of the ankle foot mechanism may be more important than for transtibial amputees and that more studies are needed. High activity transfemoral users are likely to be prescribed more sophisticated knee mechanisms and this will impact on the decision on which foot is appropriate to complement the knee action.</P>
<P>When individuals with a lower limb amputation were asked which prosthetic foot they preferred, only the A-study concluded that no specific foot was favoured although there were differences in the mechanical characteristics of the prosthetic feet (<LINK REF="STD-Postema-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Postema 1994</LINK>). This implies that besides the functional benefits of a prosthesis and the functional needs of the individual, the participants' own interpretation of walking difficulty is also of value for the prosthetic prescription.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from high quality comparative studies for the overall superiority of any individual type of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanism, although there is a small trend towards the Flex-foot in comparison with the SACH foot for greater stride length and lower energy cost in individuals with a transtibial amputation, and improved gait efficiency and lower energy cost in high activity individuals with transfemoral amputation. In prescribing prosthetic-ankle foot mechanisms for individuals with a lower limb amputation, practitioners should take into account availability, patient functional needs, patient mobility level, type of knee mechanism to be prescribed and the inter-relationship with ankle-foot mechanisms, and cost.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>For future research, functional comparisons between different prosthetic components could be more usefully categorised according to the level of activity and intended use in specific subgroups of (for example) traumatic or vascular patients. Such an approach would better acknowledge the importance of individual needs and abilities that guide clinical decision-making in daily practice. </P>
<P>Functional outcomes should be assessed for various aspects of mobility such as making transfers, maintaining balance, level walking, stair climbing, negotiating ramps and obstacles, and changing walking speed. Most of the studies included in this review assessed walking on a treadmill (at self-selected walking speeds), probably for reasons of technical and practical convenience. Indeed, <LINK REF="REF-Mulder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulder 1998</LINK> has already pointed out that the vast majority of clinical studies on human walking have used rather standardised gait assessment protocols with limited 'ecological validity'. Although perhaps less analytic, modern systems for ambulatory monitoring of human activity (<LINK REF="REF-Bussmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bussmann 2001</LINK>) are able to provide objective and valid data about (changes in) human motor behaviour during prolonged periods of hours or days in a much more ecologically valid way. Also, subjective assessments of comfort, stability and efficiency should certainly be used more when blinding of the prosthetic users can be assured. </P>
<P>The effects of different prosthetic feet should also be evaluated in patients with a through-knee or transfemoral amputation. Generalising results from transtibial to these higher levels of amputation may be invalid. </P>
