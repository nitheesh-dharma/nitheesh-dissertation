<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-13 11:09:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>IgA nephropathy is a common kidney disease that often leads to decreased kidney function and may result ultimately in kidney failure for one-third of affected people. The cause of IgA nephropathy is not known, although most people with the disease have abnormalities in their immune system. We identified 32 studies enrolling 1781 patients that met our inclusion criteria. This review found that if people with IgA nephropathy receive immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids, they may be less likely to develop kidney failure needing dialysis or transplantation. Few studies were available and the harms of therapy are currently not well understood. Larger placebo-controlled studies are now needed to be certain about the benefits and hazards of steroids on outcomes in IgA nephropathy and to identify which specific patients might benefit most from the treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-02 15:17:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis world-wide and a cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 15% to 20% of patients within 10 years and in 30% to 40% of patients within 20 years from the onset of disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-07-13 11:09:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-05-02 12:48:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>For this review update we searched the Specialised Register to 19 February 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-02 12:48:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of treatment for IgAN in adults and children and that compared immunosuppressive agents with placebo, no treatment, or other immunosuppressive or non-immunosuppressive agents.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:25:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study risk of bias and extracted data for population characteristics, interventions and outcomes including mortality, infection, hospitalisation, ESKD requiring renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation), doubling of serum creatinine, remission of proteinuria, and end of treatment urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate.</P>
<P>Estimates of treatment effect and hazards were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. Treatment effects were expressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-13 11:09:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We included 32 studies comprising 1781 participants. Risk of bias within the included studies was generally high: 22 studies (69%) did not describe the method used to generate the randomisation sequence; 24 (75%) did not describe the methods used to conceal allocation; performance bias was not reported or high in 30 studies (94%); detection bias was unclear in 31 studies (97%); attrition bias was low in 14 studies (44%), unclear in eight (25%) and high in 12 studies (38%); reporting bias was low in 21 studies (67%) and high in 10 studies (31%); and four studies received industry funding or were terminated early (13%).</P>
<P>Steroids lowered risks of progression to ESKD (6 studies, 341 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.80), and doubling of serum creatinine (6 studies, 341 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.69), lowered urinary protein excretion (6 studies, 263 participants: MD -0.49 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.25); and preserved glomerular filtration rate (4 studies, 138 participants: MD 17.87 mL/min/1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>, 95% CI 4.93 to 30.82) compared to no treatment or placebo. Combining steroids plus renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors lowered the risk of progression to ESKD (2 studies, 160 participants: RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.59) and reduced urinary protein excretion (1 study, 38 participants: MD -0.20 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.14) compared with RAS inhibitors or steroids alone. Cytotoxic agents (azathioprine) plus steroid regimens plus dipyridamole increased remission of proteinuria (1 study, 78 participants: RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.52) compared to steroids alone but had uncertain effects on other outcomes. </P>
<P>Mycophenolate mofetil plus RAS inhibitors lowered the risk of progression to ESKD (1 study, 40 participants: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.90), improved remission of proteinuria (1 study, 40 participants: RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.39) and reduced urinary protein excretion (1 study, 40 participants: MD -1.26 g/24 h, 95% CI -1.46 to -1.06). Effects of other immunosuppressive regimens (including cyclosporin, leflunomide) were inconclusive primarily due to insufficient data from the individual studies. Subgroup analyses to determine the impact of patient characteristics on treatment effectiveness were not possible.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:25:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The optimal management of IgAN remains uncertain although corticosteroid therapy may lower the risks of kidney disease progression and need for dialysis or transplantation. Evidence for treatment effects of immunosuppressive agents on mortality, infection, and cancer is generally sparse or low-quality and insufficient to guide clinical practice. Available RCTs are few, small, have high risk of bias - particularly selective reporting - and generally do not systematically identify treatment-related harms. Subgroup analyses to identify specific patient characteristics that might predict better response to therapy were not possible. Larger placebo-controlled studies of corticosteroid therapy or mycophenolate mofetil which are sufficiently powered to evaluate patient-relevant end points including adverse events and that examine the optimal duration of treatment are now required in populations with IgAN with a range of kidney function.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-10 11:08:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-10 09:41:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was first described in 1968 by Dr J. Berger. Characterised by prominent mesangial IgA deposits seen diffusely on immunofluorescence microscopy, the condition was initially thought to be a rare and benign cause of recurrent haematuria (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1968</LINK>). It has since become apparent, however, that IgAN is neither rare nor benign. Although biopsy practices differ from region to region, thus affecting the frequency of diagnosis of IgAN, it has been demonstrated that IgAN is the most common glomerular disease world-wide (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1987</LINK>) with a variable prevalence ranging from 5% to more than 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schena-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schena 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, the natural history of IgAN is now known to be considerably variable and far from benign in many patients. While up to 23% of patients experience lasting remission (<LINK REF="REF-Nolin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolin 1999</LINK>), 40% can develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Manno-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manno 2007</LINK>), while another 30% experience decreased kidney function (<LINK REF="REF-Rekola-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rekola 1991</LINK>). Overall, as many as 15% to 50% of those affected develop chronic kidney disease and eventually ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Rostoker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostoker 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schena 2001</LINK>). Studies have demonstrated that risk factors associated with disease progression include evidence of proteinuria or elevated serum creatinine at the time of kidney biopsy, microhaematuria at diagnosis, and specific histological lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manno-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manno 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neelakantappa-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neelakantappa 1988</LINK>). These prognostic data may help stratify those patients at highest need for effective therapy.</P>
<P>Evidence suggests that IgAN is an immune-mediated process and it is widely thought that some abnormalities in immunological processes are important in the pathogenesis of this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Donadio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donadio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldo-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Waldo 1989</LINK>). Most patients have some abnormalities of the immune system some time in their disease course, including increased circulating IgA or some other humoral or cellular abnormality. Recent studies have demonstrated a defect in galactosylation and sialylation of the hinge region carbohydrate changes of the IgA1 molecule (<LINK REF="REF-Mestecky-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mestecky 1993</LINK>) and it has been shown that the IgA molecules deposited in the glomerular mesangium have the same abnormalities of glycosylation (<LINK REF="REF-Hiki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiki 2001</LINK>). Altered IgA glycosylation may enhance mesangial deposition due to the formation of abnormal circulating IgA complexes, or by promoting IgA molecular interactions with kidney matrix proteins and/or mesangial cell immune receptors Recent data suggest a role for the abnormal expression of specific microRNAs (small ribonucleic acid (RNA)) in the pathogenesis of IgAN. In particular the aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 (potentially due to the abnormal expression of miR-148b) may provide a potential pharmacologic target for IgAN (<LINK REF="REF-Serino-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serino 2012</LINK>). Nevertheless, in the absence of a thorough understanding of its pathogenesis, a consensus on optimal treatment has yet to be established.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:25:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>IgAN often progresses very slowly, taking decades to reach the clinical outcomes usually studied in clinical studies (death, need for dialysis or transplantation). It has thus been difficult to establish the most effective treatment regimen for IgAN. Reviews have examined the evidence for treatment of both adults (<LINK REF="REF-Nolin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolin 1999</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2001</LINK>) with IgAN to find optimal regimens. These analyses included studies of varying methodological quality, and are mostly case series and other forms of non-randomised evaluation. These data have resulted in conflicting information regarding the optimal therapy. The most commonly used regimens include immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids (steroids), cyclosporin A (CSA), or cyclophosphamide (CPA). Additionally, non-immunosuppressive medications including fish oils, anticoagulants, antihypertensive agents and surgical tonsillectomy with and without immunosuppression have been tested in a variety of studies including randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-10 11:08:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Given the burden of disease and the known risks of progression, as well as the lack of an accepted effective therapy, a systematic review of these treatments was necessary to aid healthcare providers in managing this condition. The present review focuses on the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive treatment for IgAN. We have updated the review published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Samuels-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuels-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 2004</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-10 09:41:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that may be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by at least two authors, who discarded studies that were not applicable; however studies and reviews that may have included relevant data or information on studies were retained initially. Two authors independently assessed retrieved abstracts and, where necessary the full text, of these studies to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:17:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Data extraction was carried out independently by at least two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study existed, reports be grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. When relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancies between published versions were to highlighted.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:24:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In people with IgAN, RCT evidence for the effects of immunosuppression on risks of death, cancer, and infection are currently absent. Corticosteroid therapy retards progression to ESKD (needing dialysis or kidney transplantation), reduces risks of doubling of SCr and lowers urinary protein excretion. Steroid treatment also preserves estimated GFR better than placebo or other treatment, although has uncertain effects on remission of proteinuria. Combined, steroid treatment plus RAS inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) slow progression to ESKD compared to RAS inhibitors alone, although treatment has uncertain effects on proteinuria. Cytotoxic agents (AZA) plus steroids plus anticoagulants increase remission of proteinuria versus steroids alone, but have uncertain effects on ESKD. Cytotoxic agents plus steroids alone have uncertain treatment effects on risks of ESKD and proteinuria. MMF increases remission of proteinuria but has uncertain effects on progression to ESKD and urinary protein excretion, compared to placebo. CSA markedly lowers urinary protein excretion more than placebo or no treatment, but has uncertain effects on risk of ESKD. Leflunomide plus corticosteroids preserves estimated GFR compared to RAS inhibitors but has uncertain effects on progression of kidney failure and proteinuria. In general, the current evidence available to evaluate immunosuppression in IgAN is moderate-low quality due to limitations in study reporting and uncertainties in treatment effects due to limited available data.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 09:44:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Generally, available studies were small and of short duration and provide inadequate systematic assessment of treatment-related harms. There are insufficient data to evaluate the effects of patient and treatment characteristics on treatment effectiveness. In particular, contributing studies are heterogeneous with respect to the proteinuria level at baseline, effects of ethnicity on treatment utility, the duration of IgAN before start of treatment, and the simultaneous or sequential use of blood-pressure lowering therapy with immunosuppressive regimens.</P>
<P>Studies were heterogeneous with respect to patient characteristics and interventions, and drawing conclusions about the optimal treatment regimens for individual patients was not possible. Available studies have also been conducted in participants with a higher risk of ESKD than might usually be encountered in nephrology practice. Accordingly the findings may not be generalisable to individuals with lower risks of progression to ESKD.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-09 14:41:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>While this analysis provides an estimate of the best available evidence, it is limited by the relative scarcity of studies that examine immunosuppressive regimens for IgAN and the methodological issues in study reporting leading to low-quality evidence for all outcomes. Specific patient characteristics that might predict treatment responses could not be explored by subgroup analyses due to the small number of available studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-15 11:30:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>This remains the only systematic review that summarises only RCTs of immunosuppressive treatment of IgAN. The review used a systematic search generated by an information specialist which was screened independently by multiple reviewers. The available data were summarised using random-effects meta-analysis and accounts for the strength of the evidence on all patient-relevant outcomes taking into account risks of bias within included studies.</P>
<P>Global guideline recommendations for the management of IgAN were published in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>). These guidelines suggest:</P>
<UL>
<LI>patients with IgAN who have persistent proteinuria above 1 gram per day despite 3 to 6 months of conservative management and who have an estimated GFR above 50 mL/min might receive benefit from steroid therapy (6 months) based on low-quality evidence;</LI>
<LI>patients with IgAN not receive combined corticosteroid and CPA or AZA treatment unless there is crescentic IgAN with deteriorating kidney function; and</LI>
<LI>not using MMF in IgAN.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The KDIGO guidelines are consistent with our finding that steroid therapy protects against risks of ESKD requiring kidney transplantation or dialysis.</P>
<P>Our review update supports the guideline suggestion that immunosuppression therapy in IgAN has insufficient evidence to support widespread treatment with CPA, AZA or MMF and that additional research data would be informative with adequate assessment of treatment-related hazards. Our findings also support the view that the potential benefits from efforts directed at proteinuria reduction for patients with IgAN remain to be determined.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:24:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-09 14:43:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Although this review comprises the most comprehensive analysis of the evidence to date, the optimal management of IgAN remains uncertain chiefly due to limitations in existing study data. Available studies are small, have short-term follow up and are heterogeneous with respect to both patient characteristics and interventions. Importantly, no data are available for treatment effects on mortality and treatment adverse events are poorly documented. Additionally, available studies in this disease setting are limited by selective reporting of outcomes which may over-estimate treatment efficacy.</P>
<P>Steroid therapy appears to be the most promising intervention to retard disease progression in people with ESKD. Caution is advised, as the high rate of ESKD in the available studies suggests that participants may be at higher risk for this outcome than many individuals with IgAN and accordingly the findings may not be generalisable to treating milder forms of IgAN. Additionally, adverse effects are incompletely studied in available studies and may be more relevant in people with earlier stages of IgAN for whom treatment benefits are less certain and in whom duration of treatment exposure might be prolonged.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-10 10:24:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>While available data suggest steroid therapy might be effective to reduce ESKD, additional specific data would be informative. Based on available data, and the promising utility of steroid therapy in IgAN, a larger placebo-controlled study of steroid therapy sufficiently powered to evaluate patient-relevant outcomes and that systematically evaluates longer-term adverse events is now warranted. studies of steroid treatment with evaluation of patient-relevant endpoints that focus on the following questions would be helpful.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Effect of baseline proteinuria level on treatment effectiveness (appropriate threshold for initiating therapy)</LI>
<LI>Adverse treatment effects</LI>
<LI>Duration of treatment</LI>
<LI>Effects of ethnicity on treatment effectiveness</LI>
<LI>Sequential or simultaneous use of steroid therapy with or without RAS inhibition</LI>
</UL>
<P>A trials network that provides a multinational multicentre approach (as is utilised in research of rare glomerulonephritides) would increase the feasibility of studies in this clinical setting that are powered to evaluate treatment effects on patient-relevant outcomes. Additional interventions that might be prioritised in treatment studies of IgAN are the benefits and harms of oral steroid regimens (e.g. as outlined in <LINK REF="STD-Yoshikawa-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshikawa 1999</LINK>) versus intravenous pulse regimens followed by oral regimens (e.g. as outlined in <LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 1999</LINK>) and treatment benefits and harms of MMF.</P>
