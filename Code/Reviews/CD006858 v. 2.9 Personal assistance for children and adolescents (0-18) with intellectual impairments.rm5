<P>Personal assistance is here defined as paid support of at least 20 hours per week for people with impairments. This review investigated the effectiveness of personal assistance versus any other form of care for children and adolescents with intellectual impairments.

It suggested that personal assistance may be preferred over other services; however, some people prefer other models of care.

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>There is a high and increasing prevalence of intellectual impairments among children and adolescents in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance in the form of individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments (0-18 years) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e.g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities due to permanent impairments. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. Outcome data were extracted. Studies were assessed for the possibility of bias. Results and potential sources of bias are presented for included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One included study randomised 1002 participants to personal assistance or usual care. Whilst personal assistance was generally preferred over other services, some people prefer other models of care. This review indicates that personal assistance may have some benefits for some recipients and may benefit caregivers. However, near complete dependence on proxy respondents raises concerns about the validity of these results. Paid assistance probably substitutes for informal care and may cost government more than alternatives; however, the total costs to recipients and society are currently unknown.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Research in this field is limited. When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definition of impairments</HEADING>
<P>The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to <I>impairment</I> as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular <I>activities</I> as a result of impairments, and a person's <I>participation</I> in education, social life, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms <I>disability</I> or <I>handicap</I>.</P>
<P>This review includes children and adolescents with intellectual impairments (which include 'learning impairments', 'learning disabilities', 'intellectual disabilities', 'mental retardation', and impairments resulting from acquired brain injuries or 'traumatic brain injury'). Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently, and interventions to improve participation differ according to user needs. Furthermore, impairments affect people differently over the course of their lives. This is part of a series of reviews conducted with the Cochrane and Campbell collaborations; young people with physical impairments or both physical impairments and intellectual impairments are considered separately, as are working-age adults and older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008c</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008d</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prevalence of impairments</HEADING>
<P>Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (<LINK REF="REF-UN-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 1990</LINK>) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates.</P>
<P>The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have 'profound' impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (<LINK REF="REF-Alberman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1995</LINK>). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Larroque-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larroque 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson_x002d_Costello-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson-Costello 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many children who experience limitations in learning ability also experience functional limitations. Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by <LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1997</LINK>). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1997</LINK>). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UN-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1997</LINK>). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (<LINK REF="REF-Wenger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenger 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Impacts</HEADING>
<P>Proponents of the <I>social model of disability </I>regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (<LINK REF="REF-Abberley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abberley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1990</LINK>). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., allowing sufficient time between activities for children with impairments to toilet), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem.</P>
<P>Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Hammal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihaylov-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihaylov 2004</LINK>). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1997</LINK>). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Neely_x002d_Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neely-Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pit_x002d_Ten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pit-Ten 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varni 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2001</LINK>). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2000</LINK>). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (<LINK REF="REF-Rossiter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossiter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thyen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thyen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments and costs are positively related to severity of impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>). Caring for a child with impairments may cause family members (notably mothers) to withdraw from work and social life and put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (<LINK REF="REF-Neely_x002d_Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neely-Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-15 01:19:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, and health of children and adolescents.</P>
<P>There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with intellectual impairments. For example, social activities may be designed such that children and adolescents with intellectual impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (<LINK REF="REF-Colver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colver 2005</LINK>). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Skills training, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities.</P>
<P>Personal assistance is paid support given children and adolescents with impairments in various settings to enable them to participate in mainstream activities. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance may aim to improve mental and physical health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments and differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time in that it is indefinite and ongoing.</P>
<P>Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, the U.S. and Canada. The naming of personal assistance may vary from country to country, which is often related to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. For example, personal assistance may be provided through agencies or through individual budgets.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-16 09:37:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. High staff turnover rates, low wages, and lack of training are potential problems (<LINK REF="REF-Keigher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keigher 2000</LINK>). Having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users' need for privacy, or with parents' own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children.</P>
<P>Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, children and people with intellectual impairments may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage their care. Groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments may prefer other services. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (<LINK REF="REF-Pijl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijl 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-15 03:59:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been non-systematic reviews of studies of personal assistance services for people with different types of impairments, for example spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglund-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglund 2004</LINK>). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (<LINK REF="REF-Socialstyrelsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socialstyrelsen 2005</LINK>).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to 'no-intervention' (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and to participate in normal activities due to permanent intellectual impairments.</P>
<P>Young people living in institutions for people with impairments were excluded.</P>
<P>Children and adolescents with physical impairments were excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>In consultation with experts and the reference group (see Acknowledgements), the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. Twenty hours of assistance is the minimum required to qualify a person for personal assistance in several countries with national schemes.</P>
<P>This review defines personal assistance as individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week, which is provided for an indefinite period of time (i.e., <I>not</I> rehabilitation or respite care).<BR/> <BR/>Comparisons could have included, either singly or in combination, informal care (which might be delivered by parents or other family members), institutionalisation, service housing (cluster housing), on-demand services, night patrols, transportation services, and other alternatives to personal assistance. 'No-treatment' and 'waiting list' groups were eligible even if other services received were not described. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) were included. These were treated as separate comparisons.</P>

Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believed it was unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980.</P>
<P>No language restrictions were imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases were searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) were searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases were searched in appropriate languages.</P>
<P>No filters based on methodology were applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies.</P>
<P>The authors worked with the reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2005</LINK>) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that was likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers).</P>

<P>Two reviewers (EMW and PM) independently assigned the one included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) where:<BR/>(A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);<BR/>(B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known);<BR/>(C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number); and<BR/>(D) indicates that random allocation was not used.</P>
<P>Studies in all quality categories were considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants is described in the Table of Included Studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline.</P>
<P>Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews. At present, evidence indicates that 'scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually' (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>; see also <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following components are considered in the Description of Studies and the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' and accompanying 'Risk of bias' table:<BR/>1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?);<BR/>2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?);<BR/>3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?);<BR/>4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?);<BR/>5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>); and<BR/>6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?)</P>

<P>One included study randomised 1002 participants to personal assistance or usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Carlson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Carlsson 2007 conducted a study involving children, adults and the elderly in three states. Inclusion criteria, contextual factors and implementation differed across sites. In this and related reviews, results for each group at each site are treated as individual trials to allow inclusion of data in the appropriate reviews, to facilitate subgroup analyses and to permit tests for homogeneity across sties. The review includes data for children in Florida (FL).</P>
<P>Eligible Medicaid beneficiaries were randomly assigned to receive a monthly payment (personal assistance) in lieu of other Medicaid services or to receive usual care from 1999 to 2003. Children and adolescents qualified if they had sufficient need, low intelligence quotient, and a diagnosis of mental retardation, autism, spina bifida, cerebral palsy or Prader Willi syndrome. At baseline, most participants were under 13 years old (see table 'Characteristics of Included Studies').</P>
<P>All participants or their representatives - 501 in each the intervention and control group - completed a baseline survey (99% by proxy, mostly parents). Participants in the intervention group were contacted by a counsellor who helped them develop spending plans, provided advice and monitored services. They received more paid care than control participants, who often paid for care out of pocket (20 versus 15 hours per week).</P>
<P>After assignment, the authors describe the intervention enrolment process as complex and discouraging; only 22% of participants received cash assistance within 3 months, 29% never received assistance, and 20% disenroled during the following year (of whom, 88% withdrew before the assistance started). The average monthly payment at enrolment was $1108 Of those still living in the community, 69% of the personal assistance group was receiving cash at 9 month follow-up. At 9 months, 79% and 65% of participants in the personal assistance and control groups reported receiving paid care in the previous two weeks (p&lt;0.01). They received 237 hours and 247 hours in total (p=0.23), 40 and 30 of which was paid (p&lt;0.01). Of those who hired a worker in the first 9 months, 41% hired a worker who lived with them.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-05-16 09:40:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 2007</LINK>, the risk of bias overall was low, as described in the Description of Studies and in the 'Risk of Bias' table, below.</P>
<P>
<B>Performance bais</B>
<BR/>The study was somewhat vulnerable to performance bias. Participants were probably unsatisfied with existing services and control participants may have been motivated to report negative outcomes. Satisfaction with the intervention was a primary outcome of this review and insofar as satisfaction with services influences one's perception of other outcomes, it may be impossible to disentangle these variables.</P>
<P>
<B>Detection bias</B>
<BR/>Most outcome measures did not appear particularly vulnerable to detection bias; the direction of such effects could not be determined in any case. Short follow-up makes it impossible to detect benefits or harms that occur as a result of continued use of personal assistance. Particularly, cost data should be interpreted with caution as these refer to charges to a specific government programme; no effort was made to estimate total costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Report bias</B>
<BR/>There was some evidence of report bias in publications, as detailed in Table 9, though further data are available online. Details presented here are based on published reports and available manuscripts (see: www.mathematica-mpr.com). As more information from this trial emerges, we plan to include it in updates of this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Attrition bias</B>
<BR/>The risk of attrition bias appeared low, though the number of participants in different analyses at the same interval varies considerably; means are predicted using ordinary least squares regression or logit models.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome validity</B>
<BR/>The study used a mix of objective outcomes and other outcome measures, some of which were not validated.</P>
<P>The proportion of data collected by proxy is noteworthy because services for people with intellectual impairments can provide the 'illusion of client involvement, rather than the reality', particularly for people who have difficulty communicating verbally (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>).</P>

For several measures of satisfaction, there were not significant effects in favour of the treatment group: rude and disrespectful behaviour by a paid caregiver, paid caregivers taking something without asking, and paid caregiver giving unwanted help.

For unmet needs for help with transportation (e.g. to and from a physician's office, shopping, school, work, and social and recreational activities), there was a 'modest' (less than 10% and less than half the size of the control group proportion or its complement) and significant relationship favouring the treatment group.

However, it had little effect on emotional strain (39% and 42% experienced a great deal of strain, p=0.50), the feeling that caregiving limited privacy (61% and 66%, p=0.13) or free time (81% and 82%, p=0.78). Personal assistance reduced financial strain (44% and 56% said caregiving caused a great deal of strain, p&lt;0.01), but not the chance that a person who wanted outside work would not seek employment due to caregiving (53% and 57%, p=0.19). The intervention did not reduce absenteeism (84% and 83%, p=0.66). It reduced the chance of experiencing a great deal of physical strain (35% and 42%, p&lt;0.05) and experiencing negative health outcomes due to caregiving (42% and 55%, p&lt;0.01).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-07 16:03:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>This review identifies some evidence that personal assistance recipients may might benefit children with intellectual impairments. Impacts on carers appear somewhat mixed. Further data would be required to draw conclusions about cost.</P>
<P>This review did not identify any studies that investigated the impact of personal assistance on mental health outcomes for children with intellectual impairments or their families. Children and adolescents with intellectual and physical impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2001</LINK>). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are also at risk for psychological problems (<LINK REF="REF-Rossiter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossiter 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thyen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thyen 1998</LINK>). Further studies would be required to determine if personal assistance has broad impacts on mental health outcomes and how those outcomes might change as children mature.</P>
<P>The substantial amount of paid assistance received by participants in the control group underscores the fact that people receive both unpaid and paid assistance without external intervention. These data suggest that providing personal assistance is likely to raise government or insurance costs by paying for work that users would otherwise hire themselves and by paying for time that people would otherwise spend providing assistance for free.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-05-16 09:37:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 1002 participants in one U.S. state. More trials would be required to demonstrate if these results generalise to other countries and populations. Furthermore, the follow-up period was short and this review does not provide information about the long term impacts of personal assistance.</P>
<P>No study compared a very large amount of personal assistance (e.g., 90 hours per week) to another form of service. Large amounts of assistance are increasingly common in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia. As a result, the conclusions of this review may not extend to users with very severe impairments or to more intense models of personal assistance.</P>
<P>Cost data have limited generalisability. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 2007</LINK> are not comprehensive and implications for different stakeholders may be quite different; the relative costs of personal assistance and other services may be contextually dependent, varying from country to country.</P>
<P>Research and service provision for people with intellectual impairments may both be limited. It has been noted that 'despite the concentration in the literature on programs delivering personal assistance services, the reality is that the vast majority of persons with severe disabilities have no contact with formal programs' (<LINK REF="REF-Nosek-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosek 1991</LINK>). For example, <LINK REF="REF-Askheim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Askheim 2003</LINK> identified 24 users with intellectual impairments in Norway. Of those, 16 answered a survey. Askheim notes 'there are no exact official figures of how many intellectual[ly] disabled personal assistance users there are in Norway. Investigations after we did our survey show that the number is a little higher than 24.' As services like Cash and Counselling expand, which is similar to 'Direct Payments' in Britain and similar services that are expanding throughout Europe, there will be more users with intellectual impairments. The impacts of personal assistance for children and for people with intellectual impairments should be investigated further.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-05-16 09:40:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Carlson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 2007</LINK> has high internal validity, but low uptake and non-response raise questions about the external validity of these results. Dropout may suggest that some users eventually determine they prefer other services or it may indicate that they become unable to manage personal assistance. For this reason, Nosek suggests that personal assistance be offered to some individuals on a trial basis for a limited time so that 'both consumers and providers of services could assess the feasibility of management arrangements and mutually define the parameters of management responsibilities' (<LINK REF="REF-Nosek-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosek 1991</LINK>). When intervention participants can choose to return to other models of support rather than receive personal assistance, it may not be surprising that consumers select the option that leads to the best outcomes for them. Consequently, it is difficult to separate the benefits of personal assistance per se and the benefits of consumer choice.</P>
<P>Finally, proxy interviews were used in place of direct communication for most participants. While assessments for people with intellectual impairments can provide the 'illusion of client involvement, rather than the reality' (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>), interviews with carers may not accurately represent the views of adults with intellectual impairments.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There have been relatively few controlled studies of personal assistance for children who require a great deal of assistance. Existing evidence suggests that personal assistance is generally preferred over other services by people who agree to participate in research; however, some people prefer other models of care. This review indicates that personal assistance may have some benefits for some recipients; however, the relative total costs to recipients and society are unknown. This review does not indicate that personal assistance would be superior to other services for people who are already satisfied with the assistance they receive. </P>

The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures' (<LINK REF="REF-Ratzka-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratzka 1986</LINK>). While several studies have been conducted since the 1980s, few studies have compared directly personal assistance and other services and further evaluations are required to determine the relative merits of different ways of organising assistance. It would be possible to compare personal assistance to other services or to different forms of personal assistance in locations implementing new programmes. Similarly, new users might be assigned to different models of personal assistance in locations with long-standing personal assistance services. </P>
<P>Services for children and adolescents with impairments are organised differently around the world. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine (i) what marginal benefits are gained from personal assistance (i.e. the added value compared to other services that exist today), (ii) at what total relative cost and (iii) which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people.</P>

<P>Allocation was random. Participants were assessed by telephone at baseline and 9 months. Carers were assessed at 10 months.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants had to be current users of the state's personal care benefit. They ranged in age from 3 to 17 years; 21% were 3 to 6, 28% were 7 to 9, 22% were 10 to 12, 17% were 13 to 15, and 12% were 16 or 17. Overall, 37% were female, 80% white and 19% Hispanic (regardless of race). Few (18%) lived in a rural area. Most participants were dependent in several ADLs; 61%, 84% and 91% were not independent in transferring, toileting and bathing; 66% expressed a need for more help with personal care.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Participants received a monthly allowance that could be used to hire caregivers. Intervention participants received approximately 20 hours of paid care per week compared to 15 hours of paid care per week in the control group.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Description: Data are available online (www.cashandcounseling.org); however, in current published reports, many scales with four options were collapsed to create dichotomous outcome measures of the most extreme options and data for most outcomes are not reported numerically.<BR/>
<BR/>Minimum detectable differences are reported. Participants were excluded from certain analyses if relevant conditions were met (e.g. paid caregivers acting as proxy respondents were not asked about consumer satisfaction with care). This was designed to prevent detection biases that would overestimate programme effects and might result in biases that underestimate program impacts (e.g. impacts on informal caregivers might be biased as a result of excluding those caregivers who became paid caregivers). The authors sent a 26 page survey to all participating consultants (who were also involved in trials of cash and counselling for older adults) 18 months after enrolment began, which included many open-ended questions; 37 of 50 consultants responded. This may have increased the probability of detecting problems in the intervention group and strengthens the claim that consumer-directed personal assistance is safe.<BR/>
<BR/>None of the main outcomes included all participants randomised. Some outcomes were measured through program records while others were measured thorough client interviews or interviews with proxies. Consequently, the number of participants in different analyses at the same interval varies considerably; outcome measures included 441 and 418 participants for service use, 289 and 273 for satisfaction with paid caregivers, 378 and 418 for unmet needs, 439 and 418 for adverse events, and 378 and 418 for overall satisfaction with care. At nine months, survey response rates in the intervention and control groups were 87% and 82%, all of which were completed by parents (14% and 0% by paid caregivers). The authors report that they attempted to contact participants in the intervention group who disenrolled from the intervention, most of whom returned to agency-directed services. Means are predicted using ordinary least squares regression or logit models.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Comment: Reasons for exclusion are well-documented and logically justified. Appropriate models appear to have been used to account for missing data. Criteria for including participants in particular analyses may have impacted the results, though the resultant biases were not consistent in direction. Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed.</P>

<P>Multiple measures</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If we conduct meta-analyses in which only one effect estimate can be used from each study, we will select one measure if it is more valid or reliable than the others. For example, if a single respondent completes both a validated scale assessing multiple domains of quality of life and an unvalidated visual analogue scale, we will select the validated scale. If a study includes several equally valid measures and only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance).<BR/>

<P>Multiple arms</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, the most intense service or the service that best follows the goals of personal assistance (e.g., services that give users more control) will be included in the meta-analysis. If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, 'no-treatment' controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most common intervention in clinical practice will be chosen to maximise the external validity of the results.<BR/>

<P>Data synthesis<BR/>(Outcome data)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Meta-analyses may be conducted to combine comparable outcome measures across studies. All overall effects will be calculated using inverse variance methods. Random-effects models will be used because studies may include somewhat different treatments or populations.<BR/>

<TD>
<P>Dichotomous data</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Within studies, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for comparisons of dichotomous outcome measures. Dichotomous outcome measures may be combined by calculating an overall RR and 95% CI.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Continuous outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Continuous outcome measures may be combined when means and standard deviations or complete significance testing statistics are available, unless statistical tests assuming normality would be inappropriate. For example, for scales beginning with a finite number (such as 0), effect estimates will not be combined unless a mean is greater than its standard deviation (otherwise the mean would be very unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). If continuous outcomes are measured identically across studies, an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI may be calculated. If the same continuous outcome is measured differently across studies, an overall standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI may be calculated (Higgins 2005). SMDs will be calculated using Hedges g.<BR/>

<P>Types of analyses</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; Higgins 2005) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Homogeneity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The consistency of results will be assessed using the I-squared statistic (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003). If there is evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic p less than or equal to 0.1 coupled with an I-squared value of 25% or greater), the authors will consider sources according to pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses (below) but will not report an overall estimate of effect size. If heterogeneity remains within these subgroups, the review will report the results on a trial-by-trial basis, in a narrative summary.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Subgroup analyses</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (Counsell 1994; Oxman 1992; Yusuf 1991). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups:<BR/>1) Organisation of services<BR/>2) Place of residence<BR/>3) Acquisition of impairment<BR/>4) Amount of assistance</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Assessment of bias</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of lower quality studies (i.e., those rated C and D on allocation concealment) on the results of the review. To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (Deeks 2005; Egger 1997; Sterne 2001). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses.<BR/>
