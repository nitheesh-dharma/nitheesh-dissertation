<P>Infection with the parasite <I>Trypanosoma cruzi</I> causes American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease. There is evidence that trypanocidal drug treatment, using nitrofuran and imidazolic compounds, can treat acute trypanosomiasis cruzi infections. However, it is not clear if these interventions are effective for chronic infection specifically overt, chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy. We systematically reviewed the literature for randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trials with or without placebo published since 1965 when these treatments first became available. We found a single double blind randomized clinical trial and five case-control or case series which addressed trypanocidal treatment of chronic <I>Typanosoma cruzi </I>infection (chronic Chagas disease) in human beings. After reviewing this limited evidence we concluded that treatment with these drugs is not sufficiently well supported regarding clinical value and capacity to eliminate tissue parasitism or induce disappearance of circulating antibodies. Currently new drugs are being developed and clinical trials are needed to evaluate their use in chronic <I>Typanosoma cruzi </I>infection and related diseases.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis) may develop progressive and potentially lethal heart conditions.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-23 11:21:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>American Trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease (<LINK REF="REF-Chagas-1909" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chagas 1909</LINK>), is caused by a flagellate protozoan parasite, <I>Trypanosoma cruzi</I>. The geographical distribution of the human <I>T.cruzi</I> infection extends from Southern United States and Mexico to the south of Argentina. The disease affects 16 - 18 million people and it is estimated that 100 million i.e. about 25% of the population of Latin America is at risk of acquiring Chagas disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>People are infected with Chagas disease by the following routes.</P>
<P>(a) Vectoral transmission: <I>T.cruzi </I>parasites, living in the gut of the Triatomine insects enter the bloodstream through the bite of the insect. Triatomine bugs live in cracks and crevices of poor-quality houses usually in rural areas, emerge at night to bite and extract blood from human hosts. <I>T.cruzi</I> parasites are present in insect faeces deposited during the blood meal and enter the bloodstream through the wound when it is scratched or rubbed.</P>
<P>(b) Transfusion linked transmission - or iatrogenic transmission: Through transfusion with blood infected with <I>T.cruzi</I> or allotransplants is the second important transmission pathway.</P>
<P>(c) Vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus, laboratory accidents and other routes has also been described (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monte_x00f3_n_x002d_Padilla-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monteón-Padilla 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nickerson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickerson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinto 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schmunis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmunis 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The clinical course of Chagas disease is characterized by an initial "acute phase", in which parasitemia is easily demonstrated. During this phase clinical symptoms may or may not be apparent, but most people spontaneously improve within six to eight weeks. Demonstration of circulating parasites confirms the clinical diagnosis. After a few weeks of infection an immune response may occur which is life long. Chronic infection may result in an "interdeterminate phase" of Chagas disease which is a long asymptomatic period that can last 30 to 40 years or more. The only proof of infection is a strong immune response with high titer of anti <I>T.cruzi</I> antibodies. Within this phase approximately 30% of chronically infected persons develop irreversible alterations of heart muscle and enlargement of the intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Barretti-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barretti 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmunis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmunis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanowitz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanowitz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). This is called chronic Chagas disease or the chronic symptomatic phase, and most cases will have chronic Chagasic cardiopathy (CCC), a specific cardiomyopathy, characterized by heart failure with bizarre rhythm and/or conduction defects. Unfortunately during the chronic phase it is difficult to demonstrate the presence of parasites either in peripheral blood or tissues. Therefore, immunoserology, and recently immunohistochemistry and biomolecular techniques are used as diagnostic assays.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Control and treatment of Chagas disease</HEADING>
<P>Although treatment is the focus of this review, it is important to put the impact of treatment into the broader context of the international efforts to control transmission. In 1991 the Health Ministries of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, created the South Cone Initiative, with the objective of eliminating the vectoral transmission of Chagas disease by the year 2010 and establishing permanent blood donor screening to avoid transfusion linked transmission. To date, advances have been made. Uruguay was declared free of vectoral transmission in 1998 and in the remaining countries, active transmission rates has fallen from 96% to 75%; and the infection rate in the young population (below 18-year-old) is now between 0.17 to 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Cecere-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cecere 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliveira_x002d_Filho-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveira-Filho 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_de_x002d_Arias-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-de-Arias 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schofield-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schofield 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is hoped that through initiatives such as "South Cone", transmission of <I>T.cruzi </I>parasites will be significantly reduced or stopped in the near future. Unfortunately, Chagas disease will continue to impose a high social and economical cost (<LINK REF="REF-Cecere-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cecere 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliveira_x002d_Filho-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveira-Filho 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_de_x002d_Arias-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-de-Arias 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schofield-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schofield 1999</LINK>). This is because of the long latent phase of the disease (10 to 30 years) and the considerable number of infected people that are currently in the chronic (indeterminate) phase of Chagas disease. A high proportion of people currently symptomless will in the future experience symptoms of Chagas disease.</P>
<P>A report describing 10 years of experience in Honduras, Guatelmala, and Bolivia focusing on feasible protocols, safety of drug therapy and treatment effectiveness, concluded that it is possible to implement a Chagas disease diagnosis and treatment program even in limited resources settings. However, treatment effectiveness may be related to differences in patients and parasite populations. New treatments with improved safety profiles, paediatric formulations and more a reliable test of cure are urgently needed (<LINK REF="REF-Yun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yun 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trypanocidal drugs have been used in the treatment of Chagas disease since the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Brener-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brener 1975</LINK>), when nitrofurans and later imidazolic drugs were introduced after a long history of therapeutic failures lasting 50 years. The trypanocidal drug Nifurtimox (3- methyl-N-`[(5 -nitro-2 furanyl)-methylene]-4-morpholinamine 1,1 dioxide) and Benznidazole (2-nitro-N-[phenylmethyl]-1H-imidazole-1-acetamide) are thought to exert their action by generation of free radicals either in intact cells or <I>Trypanosoma cruzi </I>lysates. However, the mechanisms involved in such reactions are ill defined (<LINK REF="REF-Stoppani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoppani 1999</LINK>). Recently Kubata et al, (<LINK REF="REF-Kubata-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubata 2002</LINK> ) studying intracellular trypanosomal arachidonic acid and its metabolism in these parasites, found an enzyme which reduced prostanoid metabolites as well as naphthoquinone and nitro heterocyclic drugs .This reduction results in drug derived quinone intermediates as a source of free radicals which cause damage in organelles of parasitic protozoa. These reactions clarify the mechanism of action for both Nifurtimox and Benznidazole.</P>
<P>Both nitrofurans and imidazole derivatives (Nifurtimox and Benznidazole respectively) have a well recognized clinical activity limited to acute and early chronic trypanosoma infections, achieving a cure rate near to 76% after four weeks of treatment. Some promising results have been reported in the treatment of infected individuals in the chronic (indeterminate) phase of Chagas disease in trials carried out in Argentina and Brazil where reduction of parasitaemia ranges from 58% to 95% (<LINK REF="REF-de-Andrade-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Andrade 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sosa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoppani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoppani 1999</LINK>). In addition a Cochrane systematic review of Trypanocidal drugs for chronic asymptomatic <I>Trypanosoma cruzi</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2002</LINK>) showed that "nitro imidazolic derivatives substantially and significantly modified parasite-related outcomes compared to placebo and that other agents showed borderline or not significant effect." The review concluded that "Trypanocidal therapy, particularly nitro imidazolic derivatives given to children or young adults with positive xenodiagnosis improve parasite-related outcomes" (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2002</LINK>). But efficacy in later stages of the disease is questionable. People with CCC are usually older than 25 years. Treatment for the late chronic symptomatic phase of Chagas disease is usually limited to managing complications associated with the pathology found in the heart and digestive organs, and avoiding antiparasitics drugs because of potential adverse reactions. However, recent studies have shown that chronically ill patients treated with Benznidazole had a significant reduction of blood antibodies compared with those in a placebo group. There is evidence that even if no cure was possible, fewer electrocardiographic abnormalities were found in the treatment group which may be interpreted as due to the delay in tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Moretti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moretti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segura-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mady-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mady 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>However until the development of the ideal drug for the treatment of Chagas disease, Coura et al (<LINK REF="REF-Coura-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coura 2009</LINK>) proposed to treat chagasic patients with a combination of currently used drugs such as Nifurtimox and Beznidazole, along with potential drugs like Allopurinol, and first, second and third generation antifungal agents, all of which have different mechanisms of action in order to boost the action of different compounds and avoid the development of parasite resistance.</P>
<P>A double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in 55 individuals from endemic areas of Central Brazil was conducted, authors concluded that at the used dose (900 mg/d), Allopurinol was not effective to clear T. Cruzi form peripheral blood of infected individuals. (<LINK REF="REF-Rassi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rassi 2007</LINK>)</P>
<P>New drugs have been tested like the modified candidate cancer, which have shown picomolar activity against cultured <I>T. cruzi</I> and was efficacious in a mouse model of acute Chagas disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kraus-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraus 2009</LINK>)</P>
<P>Further studies need to be conducted, in both the acute and the chronic phases of the disease, in which strict cure criteria are established, specific diagnostic tests are used (e.g. PCR methods) together with long term follow-up and with clinically relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>The potential of trypanocidal therapy to modify CCC remains to be evaluated (<LINK REF="REF-Urbina-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbina 2009</LINK>). Therefore, we therefore conducted a systematic review of the effects of treatment with Nitrofuran or imidazolic derivatives on clinically relevant outcomes in people with CCC.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acute phase</HEADING>
<P>This is the phase immediately following infection. Acute symptoms only occur in about 1% of cases. Most people infected do not seek medical attention. The most recognized symptom of acute Chagas infection is the Romaña's sign, or swelling of the eye on one side of the face, usually at the site of the bite, or by direct infection of the conjunctiva. Other symptoms are usually not specific for Chagas infection. These symptoms may include fatigue, fever, enlarged liver or spleen, and swollen lymph glands. Sometimes, a rash, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and vomiting occur. Infants and very young children with acute Chagas disease can develop meningoencephalitis which can cause death. In general, symptoms last for 4-8 weeks in the acute phase and then disappear even if no treatment is given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indeterminate phase</HEADING>
<P>During this stage, people do not have symptoms. These chronically infected individuals become seropositive and remain asymptomatic for the next 10-30 years or for the rest of their lives when, if the electrocardiogram is normal and no evidence of cardiomegaly or digestive mega viscera is observed at X-rays, they are defined as in the indeterminate phase.</P>

<P>Ten to 30 years after infection, people may develop the most serious symptoms of Chagas disease. Cardiac problems, including an enlarged heart, altered heart conduction or rhythm, heart failure, or cardiac arrest are symptoms of chronic disease. Chagas disease can also lead to enlargement of parts of the digestive tract, which result in severe constipation or problems with swallowing. In persons who are immune compromised, including persons with HIV/AIDS, Chagas disease can be severe. Not everyone will develop the chronic symptoms of Chagas disease.</P>

<P>We found only 6 articles on treatment of chronic Chagasic cardiopathy, of which only one was a randomised controlled trial and therefore only one study is included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Coura-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Coura 1997</LINK>). This trial comprised a total of 77 people in Brazil and compared the effects of treatment with Nifurtimox or Benznidazol with placebo. Infection was assessed using indirect immunofluorescence in screening assay followed by positive complement fixation as well as confirmatory parasitologic assay (at least two out of three positive xenodiagnoses tests) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The other five articles on treatment of chronic Chagasic cardiopathy have been excluded (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>An updated search in 2008 resulted in 87 new records, after removal of duplicates. None of these were eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>In the latest update in 2010, 52 new references were identified, of which 18 were eliminated because they referred to other infectious diseases. Eleven were related to treatment of Chagas disease, and one of these references belongs to the ongoing BENEFIT study (<LINK REF="STD-Marin_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marin-Neto 2008</LINK>). The remaining, 23 studies treated other aspects of Chagas diseases. The ongoing study (BENEFIT), is a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial which will include 3,000 patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy from three Latin American countries (<LINK REF="STD-Marin_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marin-Neto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marin_x002d_Neto-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin-Neto 2009</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>

<P>Study participants were recruited from two places in Minais Gerais, Brazil, all of the had CCC with an independently established diagnosis which included seropositivity, xenodiagnosis, clinical assessment including ECG and oesophagram. We graded the methodologcal quality as B: 77 participants were randomly allocated to three groups - placebo, Benznidazole and Nifurtimox. The method of randomisation was not reported. Patients and physicians were blind to treatment group (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Sixty-four patients completed the study: 23 received Benznidazol, 19 Nifurtimox and 22 placebo. Participants were evaluated at one, two, three and 12 months after treatment with three xenodiagnostic tests, with 15 days interval. In addition, participants had two serological assays. Of the 77 patients included in the study, 83% completed the full course of treatment. Confounding variables such as sex and age were evenly distributed between the groups. The sample size was too small to provide adequate power to detect clinically important differences in outcome.<BR/>

<P>Parasitologic cure was achieved in patients who received either Benznidazole or Nifurtimox, 98% and 90% respectively. However, people treated with placebo had a 66% parasitologic cure rate. There was no strong evidence of any difference in parasitologic cure between the treated and untreated groups (P &gt; 0.05). Serological reactions did not change over the follow-up and there were no clinical ECG or X-ray changes one year after treatment in any of the groups. Nifurtimox was linked to adverse effects with digestive intolerance and neuropsychiatric manifestations more commonly than Benznidazole, which was associated with cutaneous rashes, peripheral neuropathy and digestive intolerance. However, the placebo group also reported digestive manifestations. The investigators did not provide quantitative data with regard to these adverse effects of treatment. The non-randomised studies found in this search related to the treatment of chronic Chagasic cardiopathy are described next (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Coura-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Coura 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the BENEFIT study the primary outcome will be the composite of death; resuscitated cardiac arrest; sustained ventricular tachycardia; insertion of pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator; cardiac transplantation; and development of new heart failure, stroke, or systemic or pulmonary thromboembolic events.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-randomized studies</HEADING>
<P>A study was established in Brazil, of 17 patients who had completed full treatment with anti-trypanosoma drugs (nitrofurans or nitroimidazole (10mg/kg/day) and were age and sex matched with patients from a cohort study of chronic Chagasic cardiopathy patients, all of whom by immunological and/or serological assay evidence of <I>T.cruzi</I>. The aim was to determine whether serological or immunological cure correlated with molecular methods of diagnosis. Although the study was not randomised and patients and physicians were not blinded to treatment allocation, the investigators made the useful observation that despite apparent cure on immunological/serological outcome measures, the molecular markers persisted, indicating that parasites were not eliminated after treatment with nitrofuran derivatives (<LINK REF="STD-Braga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2000</LINK>). A further paper using the same cohort of patients reported the findings of a ten year follow up of 91 people with chronic Chagasic cardiopathy and 41 uninfected controls. Using molecular methods of, competitive PCR, they showed that both treated and untreated patients had evidence of active infection (<LINK REF="STD-Lauria_x002d_Pires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lauria-Pires 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>An Argentinian study aiming to compare the clinical and serological progress of cardiomyopathy in patients treated with Benznidazole and untreated individuals, recruited 70 untreated patients and 131 Benznidazol treated patients (5mg/kg /day for 30 days). The follow-up period was of an average of 8 years. The proportion of treated patients who were serologically negative at the end of follow up was higher than in the untreated group (19.1% versus 6% respectively P= 0.05). The investigators concluded that treatment with Benznidazole decreased antibody titers if treatment was used early in the course of chronic Chagasic cardiopathy, but that people over 50 years old did not appear to show a serologic response and continued to have cardiac symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Viotti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Viotti 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The further cohort study from Argentina was found which studied 198 people, drawn from a larger cohort of 492 patients which had suffered attrition due to losses to follow up, with the aim of examining the prognosis of chronic Chagasic cardiopathy in treated and untreated groups undergoing prolonged follow up. There were three groups: a) 32 patients treated with Nifurtimox (5 to 8 mg/kg/day for 60 days), b) 36 treated patients with Benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day for 30 days) and c) 130 untreated patients. All patients underwent, at the beginning or during the follow up of the cohort study, the following tests:<BR/>a) 3 serological Chagas-specific tests (DA-2ME, IHA or IIF) with titers equal or higher than 1/32, for at least two out of the three reactions.<BR/>b) EKG and chest X-ray.</P>
<P>The patients were followed for an average of 14 years (eight to 32 years). At the outset, only 9.6% of the infected patients had cardiomyopathy, but when comparing treated and untreated patients, the proportion of this cardiopathy was higher in the former group (7% versus 3.2% P &lt; 0.05), reflecting the use of drug treatment in those with symptomatic disease. The clinical prognosis was worse in the untreated group, with less likelihood of reductions in antibody titers (&lt;=1/64 in 86% versus 38% of treated and untreated patients respectively). These long-term findings suggest that drug treatment is superior to no treatment. (<LINK REF="STD-Fabro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fabro 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further long-term follow up (13-21 years) was reported in which the prognosis of acute and chronic Chagas disease was compared, with all patients receiving Benznidazole. The criteria for 'cure' was established by means of quantitative serological tests which included: complement fixation, indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination and ELISA, but given the duration of follow up, not all these tests were used in all patients. (<LINK REF="STD-Cancado-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cancado 2002</LINK>). The cure rate was higher in patients with acute disease (76%) than in those with chronic disease (8 to 9%). It was concluded that cure criteria should include parasitological, as well as immunological criteria, and that new immunological tests have opened a door to a different way of studying the natural history of Chagas disease (<LINK REF="STD-Cancado-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cancado 2002</LINK>). It is difficult to make any inferences about the effects of treatment in this study as there was no randomised control group, neither patients nor physicians were blind to treatment group, and the criteria for cure changed over the follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Cancado-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cancado 2002</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-23 17:23:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Human infection with <I>T.cruzi</I> induces an immune response in most human hosts and a chronic indolent infection is common. A proportion of infected people develop chronic symptomatic disease with two main clinical patterns: heart disease or dilated gastro-intestinal "mega" syndromes. CCC may produce a progressive heart disease characterized by rhythm and conduction disorders with or without dilated cardiomyopathy. Both high morbidity and mortality of people with these manifestations of Chagas disease is common.</P>
<P>Interventions to treat Chagas disease were initiated shortly after its description early in the twentieth century, however,over a period of 50 years, these were unsuccessful. In 1962 the first useful drug treatment was found using animal models - a nitrofuran derivative marketed as Nifurtimox, and shortly followed by an imidazolic drug, Benznidazol, both of which have become the cornerstone for treatment of American Trypanosomosis. Good results have been found in acute infection with absence of parasitaemia in most treated patients and remission of serologic response. These drug are now used in recently infected children, in cases of laboratory needle stick injuries resulting in acute infection, as well as in iatrogenic infection through contaminated blood products (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez_x002d_Coura-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez-Coura 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoppani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoppani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urbina-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbina 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In questioning the efficacy of Nifurtimox and Benznidazol in the treatment of CCC, we found one randomised trial and few non-randomised tudies, all of which had low patient numbers. There was no strong evidence to suggest that using standard treatment with either Nifurtimox or Benznidazol in patients with late stage <I>T.cruzi</I> infection was beneficial.</P>
<P>A major problem for conducting trials and interpreting long-term prognostic studies is the issue of defining 'cure'. For example, some studies have shown a significant reduction of blood antibodies and fewer ECG abnormalities in chronically infected patients treated with Benznidazol compared to a placebo group, and this was interpreted as an indication of a delay in tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Moretti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moretti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segura-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segura 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viotti-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Viotti 1994</LINK>). Clinical criteria for defining 'cure' requires the disappearance of parasitaemia but this is not easy to demonstrate in chronic cases, with the sensitivity of hemo culture or xenodiagnosis being no more than 50% at best. Inclusion of this definition is insufficient to determine the efficacy of drug treatment, and perhaps not surprisingly most papers failed to demonstrate any reduction in parasitaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Dias_x002d_Contijo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dias-Contijo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urbina-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbina 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Circulating antibodies against <I>T.cruzi</I> is a diagnostic hallmark for chronic infection. Disappearance of antibodies has been used as a definition as 'cure' in acute disease but does not feature in CCC. The current established criteria to define 'cure' in CCC are currently inadequate. New developments in molecular biology have further challenged the existing definition of 'cure'. Parasite DNA can now be clearly demonstrated in several tissues, reinforcing the notion of parasite persistence (despite apparent clinical cure) and its possible role as an inducer of immune response. Changes in Trypanosoma cruzi-specific immune response after treatment with Beznidazole have been proven by Laucella et al (<LINK REF="REF-Laucella-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laucella 2009</LINK>). They found a significant decline of peripheral interferon (IFN) gamma-producing T cells specific for T.cruzi as early as 12 months after Benznidazole treatment and became undetectable in a substantial proportion of treated subjects. They demonstrated the impact of this treatment in chronically infected people by monitoring the parasite-specific immune response which indicates the efficacy of treatment and cure.</P>
<P>Both Nifurtimox and Benznidazol are linked to adverse reactions (peripheral neuropathy, skin disorders and other health problems) in a relatively high proportion of users, indicating the need for safer and effective drugs for CCC where treatment is likely to be long-term. On balance, the limited findings of this review cast doubt on the efficacy of treatment for CCC with either Nifurtimox or Benznidazol, but do provide modest evidence of potential harm from adverse effects.</P>
<P>Currently a multicenter (BENEFIT), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of beznidazole (5 mg/kg per day) of 3,000 chagasic patients is ongoing in 35 centres in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. It also comprises a sub-study to evaluate the effects of beznidazole on parasite clearance and the impact of the etiological treatment on the left ventricular function (<LINK REF="STD-Marin_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marin-Neto 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This study will clarify the efficiency of imidazolic drugs in the treatment of chronic chagasic patients, especially when overt heart disease is present. Nitrofuran or imidazolic drugs may be useful and are recommended during acute infection and perhaps early in evolution of indeterminate chronic infected people.</P>

<P>There is no strong evidence to support treatment with either Nifurtimox or Benznidazol in patients with chronic <I>T.cruzi</I> infection and overt heart disease (CCC). There is the potential for adverse drug effects and caution in the use of these drugs in CCC should be exercised.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-13 13:26:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further studies with randomised designs are required to test the effects of both established and new drugs. The latter may be derived from molecules designed to modify parasite metabolism but without adverse effects on human physiology, i.e. a sort of " chemical bullet", which would aim to eliminate both blood and tissue parasitism. Better criteria for cure are also needed for use as outcome measures in such trials. The pathogenesis of chronic complications of <I>T.cruzi</I> infection also requires further research because the host contribution through the immune response could be a cornerstone for the development of late stage clinical disease, making anti-parasite treatment of much less relevance as the main therapeutic strategy in advanced disease.</P>
<P>Preventive measures such as those applied in Latin-America through the South Cone, Andine and Central America Initiatives may offer the best cost/ benefit approach to sustainably control Chagas disease by reducing acute infection, preventing reinfection and progression to chronic stages with target organ damage.</P>
