<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neck pain is common and can limit a person's ability to participate in normal daily activities. Massage is a widely used treatment for neck pain. In this review, it was defined as touching or manipulating the soft tissues surrounding the neck with the hand, foot, arm or elbow. There are a number of different types of massage. This review included studies that looked at Traditional Chinese massage, ischaemic compression, self-administered ischaemic pressure using a J-knob cane, conventional Western massage and occipital release, among other techniques. It did not include studies that examined techniques such as Reiki or Polarity.</P>
<P>We included 15 trials in this review that assessed whether massage could help reduce neck pain and improve function. Results showed that massage is safe, and any side effects were temporary and benign. However, massage did not show a significant advantage over other comparison groups. Massage was compared with no treatment, hot packs, active range-of-movement exercises, acupuncture, exercises, sham laser, manual traction, mobilization, and education.</P>
<P>There were a number of challenges with this review. Overall, the quality of the studies was poor and the number of participants in most trials was small. Most studies lacked a clear definition, description, or rationale for the massage technique used. Details on the credentials or experience of the person giving the massage were often missing. There was such a range of massage techniques and comparison treatments in the studies that we could not combine the results to get an overall picture of the effectiveness of massage. Therefore, no firm conclusions could be drawn and the effectiveness of massage for improving neck pain and function remains unclear.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-30 09:51:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<P>Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The overall methodology of all the trials assessed was either low or very low GRADE level. None of the trials were of strong to moderate GRADE level. The results showed very low level evidence that certain massage techniques (traditional Chinese massage, classical and modified strain/counterstrain technique) may have been more effective than control or placebo treatment in improving function and tenderness. There was very low level evidence that massage may have been more beneficial than education in the short term for pain bothersomeness. Along with that, there was low level evidence that ischaemic compression and passive stretch may have been more effective in combination rather than individually for pain reduction. The clinical applicability assessment showed that only 4/15 trials adequately described the massage technique. The majority of the trials assessed outcomes at immediate post-treatment, which is not an adequate time to assess clinical change. Due to the limitations in the quality of existing studies, we were unable to make any firm statement to guide clinical practice. We noted that only five of the 15 studies reported side effects. All five studies reported post-treatment pain, discomfort and soreness as a side effect and one study (Irnich 2001) showed that 22% of the participants experienced low blood pressure following treatment.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<P>No recommendations for practice can be made at this time because the effectiveness of massage for neck pain remains uncertain.</P>
<P>As a stand-alone treatment, massage for MND was found to provide an immediate or short-term effectiveness or both in pain and tenderness. Additionally, future research is needed in order to assess the long-term effects of treatment and treatments provided on more than one occasion.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<P>Neck pain is a very common condition. Approximately 70% of the American population experiences neck pain at some point in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Makela-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strine-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strine 2007</LINK>).  A simple neck pain in adults has a 12-month prevalence between 30%  to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Hogg_x002d_Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg-Johnson 2008</LINK>). Neck pain has a tendency to become chronic and affects 10% of males and 17% of females (<LINK REF="REF-Haraldsson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haraldsson 2006a</LINK>). Individuals with neck pain have a limited ability to participate in activities of daily living. Thus, neck pain is associated with large healthcare costs and loss of productivity attributable to sick leave taken from work. Three per cent to 11% of claimants are off work each year due to neck pain (<LINK REF="REF-C_x00f4_t_x00e9_-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Côté 2008</LINK>). It has been reported previously that chronic neck pain accounts for $150 to $215 billion US each year in economic loss (<LINK REF="REF-National-Res--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Res 2001</LINK>).  Although disabling, little is known about the effectiveness of treatment for neck pain.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<P>Massage therapy (MT)  involves the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body through touch (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2006</LINK>). It consists of techniques such as gentle effleurage, pétrissage, and myofascial trigger point release (<LINK REF="REF-Kutner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kutner 2008</LINK>). These techniques vary in the manner in which touch is applied, as well as the amount of pressure and intensity which is applied (<LINK REF="REF-Kutner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kutner 2008</LINK>). Since there is a wide spectrum of interventions and techniques that fall under the umbrella term of massage therapy, specific definitions for the techniques are lacking and there is substantial overlap among them. As such, Sherman et al proposed a three-level classification system for the different massage therapy techniques based on the goals of the treatment, the style and the technique (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2006</LINK>). The treatment goals were classified into the following: relaxation massage, clinical massage, movement re-education, and energy work (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2006</LINK>). These goals could be addressed by a variety of different styles and each style is characterized by specific techniques to achieve the goal (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<P>The mechanical effects of massage involve the process of manipulating the tissues and subsequently assisting in the breakdown of adhesions (<LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2004</LINK>).<SUP> </SUP>Physiological responses to MT as a result of the physical manipulation of the tissues include increased blood and lymph flow, a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic response, prevention of fibrosis, and the reduction of pain (<LINK REF="REF-De-Domenico-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Domenico 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2004</LINK>). Massage produces local biochemical changes such as increased blood flow and oxygenation to the muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Sagar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagar 2007</LINK>). This local response leads to increased neural activity at the spinal cord level and also at the subcortical nuclei which in turn affects mood and pain perception (<LINK REF="REF-Sagar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagar 2007</LINK>). As such, MT could potentially reduce anxiety, depression, and pain through the increase of serotonin and endorphins (<LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="kinjal patel">
<P>In the previous version of this review on massage for mechanical neck disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Haraldsson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haraldsson 2006a</LINK>), we included six trials that assessed massage as a stand-alone treatment and 14 trials that assessed massage as a part of a multimodal treatment. There were inconsistent results for massage as a stand-alone treatment. As for massage as a part of a multimodal treatment, the amount of contribution of massage to the results could not be confirmed. Furthermore, the overall quality of the trials included in the previous review was low. Two systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK>) supported the benefit of massage compared with a control or placebo for improving pain intensity in the immediate to short term. But the recommendations of both the reviews were based on low level evidence. Additionally, neither of the reviews commented on the clinical applicability of the included trials. It is of great importance to do this update as there have been additional trials conducted since our last review, and to further assess the quality and the clinical applicability of all the trials.   </P>

Function and disability could be measured using either patient self-report measures or observer-based physical performance tests (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 2002</LINK>). Measures of physical performance had to test the participant's ability to execute a simple activity in a standardised environment using a standardised test and scoring procedure; they were concerned with the testing of a co-ordinated set of functions, which formed a component of functional purposeful activity (e.g. reaching, walking, driving).</P>

'Risk of bias' tables were presented and discussed by the broader validity assessment team to maximize inter-rater reliability (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2012</LINK>). The 'Risk of bias' assessment tool has 12 criteria, which are rated as high, low, or unclear. A study is classified as having a low risk of bias when it meets six or more criteria, in the absence of other obvious serious methodological flaws. The 'Risk of bias' criteria considered included: randomisation; concealment of treatment allocation; blinding of patients, care providers and outcome assessors; data completeness; selective outcome reporting; similarity at baseline; similarity of co-interventions; acceptable compliance; and similar timing of assessment. We did not exclude studies from further consideration in this review on the basis of the 'Risk of bias' assessment, although we did use this information to inform our recommendations.</P>

<P>We provided descriptive statistics of the patient groups, interventions, outcomes, adverse effect of treatments, and cost of care. We reported all results based on the sample size analysed using the "intention-to-treat" principle (the sample randomised in the study). We assumed the minimum clinically important difference to be 10 on a 100-point pain intensity scale (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Felson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldsmith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldsmith 1993</LINK>). We considered the effect to be small when it was less than 10% of the Visual analogue scale (VAS), medium when it was between 10% and 20% of the VAS, and large when it was 20% to 30% of the VAS. For the neck disability index, we used a minimum clinically important difference of 5/50 neck disability index units for non-complicated neck pain and 10/50 for cervical radiculopathy (<LINK REF="REF-MacDermid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDermid 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stratford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratford 1999</LINK>). For other outcomes (i.e. global perceived effect and quality of life scales), where there is an absence of clear guidance on the size of clinically important effect sizes, we used the common hierarchy of <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>: small (0.20), medium (0.50) or large (0.80).</P>

The characteristics of the study participants (i.e., gender, age) (10/15 trials), reporting of outcomes (10/15 trials) and the timing of evaluation (13/15 trials) were well reported. The characteristics of the massage technique was only reported in four out of the 15 trials assessed. Details of the credentials or experience of the person administering the massage and the setting/environment were reported only in one of the studies.</P>
<P>Ten of 15 studies reported adequate selection of outcome measure. 13/15 studies assessed post-treatment evaluation at an adequate time. The majority of the studies reported it at immediate post-treatment which is not an adequate time to assess clinical change.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were infrequently reported, with only 2/15 trials reporting adverse effects to massage treatment. Due to poor reporting of adverse effects, there is uncertainty if the benefit is more important than the adverse effect. But based on clinical experience about common adverse effect to massage, it can be assumed that the benefit of massage is stronger than the rare adverse effects such as immediate pain or soreness.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 11:29:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there has been a marked increase in the number of publications that incorporate massage since a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1996</LINK>), the contribution of massage to managing cervical pain remains unclear. Our paper did not find strong or moderate level of evidence for massage alone relative to a control. Our findings are similar to the Cochrane review on conservative treatments for whiplash, which also found a predominance of low-quality, underpowered trials leading to their conclusion that "no firm conclusions could be drawn" (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies in our review assessed massage as a single treatment; however, each study used a different form of "massage" (e.g. Traditional Chinese massage, ischaemic compression, self-administered ischaemic pressure using a J-knob cane, conventional Western massage and occipital release). Attempt was made to use the  three-level classification system by Sherman et al to classify the different types of massage therapy techniques based on the goals of the treatment, the style and the technique (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2006</LINK>). But due to the lack of sufficient studies in each subcategory, it was hard to compile the data of the studies. Moreover, of the trials with non-significant findings, one gave only one treatment session (<LINK REF="STD-Hanten-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hanten 1997</LINK>), and one only assessed a self-administered massage (<LINK REF="STD-Hanten-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanten 2000</LINK>), practices that are likely to be considered sub-optimal in the clinical setting. It is also likely that the small sample sizes (median 20 per arm) and the inability to pool data made it difficult to find any statistically significant effect.</P>
<P>Our review also did not find a strong or moderate level of evidence for or against massage in studies that combined massage with other modalities. Several difficulties undermined our understanding of the contribution of massage to the overall effect. Primarily, the designs were not such that the relative contribution of massage could be ascertained from other therapies with which it was combined. Factorial designs would be needed to tease out the contribution of massage from other therapies, and these were not done. For example, two commonly used neck-pain modalities are deep tissue massage and manipulation. A 2x2 factorial design randomising first to massage or no treatment, and then randomising each of those groups to manipulation or no treatment would yield a study that allows comparison of four experimental situations: no treatment, massage alone, manipulation alone and the two treatments combined. In the absence of factorial designs, we aimed to find a superior multimodal treatment in general, but no such trend emerged.</P>
<P>Moreover, most studies lacked a definition, description, or rationale for massage as a treatment or the massage technique selected. There are numerous massage techniques and these techniques can have different physiological effects. A massage taxonomy with vocabulary, definitions and mechanisms of action of various massage approaches would significantly assist researchers in selecting appropriate techniques and interpreting the results of massage studies.</P>
<P>In addition to massage technique, researchers need to establish optimal parameters for the other components of the massage treatment, including frequency (number of MT sessions per week), duration (length of time of each massage session) and dosage (depth/pressure and duration of application of depth). Pilot studies of massage to establish an optimal, or at least adequate treatment, should be conducted prior to doing a larger trial. These pilot studies would serve a purpose similar to the small dose-finding studies conducted in pharmaceutical trials that are used to establish a minimally effective dose.</P>
<P>Some of the treatment components may affect pain outcomes as suggested in the meta-analysis by Moyer and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2004</LINK>). When assessing the total number of treatments, the authors reported no effect on pain immediately after a single massage, but significant pain reduction days to weeks after multiple massages. They found no significant trend for the duration of a session, but emphasize that in massage for pain relief, neither the optimal frequency, optimal duration of session, nor the "decay" time in analgesic effect is known.</P>
<P>The massage treatment components need to be reported in the manuscript in a transparent, standardised way. We note that many of the trials in this review did not report sufficient details on the massage characteristics to permit replication. To address the reporting and methodological issues that are inherent to the design of massage trials, reporting conventions such as those proposed in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>) for clinical trials, or the STRICTA statement (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2002</LINK>) for clinical trials of acupuncture specifically, are needed for massage trials. We also note the lack of reporting on the qualifications or experience of those performing the massage. This may reflect the lack of consideration given to this issue. Individuals who do massage range from those with no formal training to those with doctoral degrees in massage therapy. Potential variability in outcomes may be associated with the level of experience or training of those who performed the massage. Future trials need to provide justification for the therapist(s) selected to perform the intervention. To ensure the competence of the massage professional(s), investigators in recent studies have set minimal credential and experience criteria and even conducted a working interview (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of trials did not report adverse events. From the trials reporting them, adverse effects of massage appear to be minimal and transient. It was not clear from the reports whether adverse effects had been measured or not. In order to achieve a balanced discussion between efficacy and harm, trials need to document all adverse events in a standardised format and, equally important, to document if none occur.</P>
<P>In our review, no trials met the criteria of double-blinding (blinded patients and care providers). This is because in massage studies, blinding patients can be difficult and blinding care providers is impossible. Therefore, other design features must attempt to compensate for the lack of blinding. Treatments need to be equally credible and acceptable to patients to minimize placebo effects and high dropout rates. It is also necessary to collect and report information on patients' previous experience with massage, or their expectations of massage, in order to assess the impact of expectations. Finally, although it is difficult to blind the patients and therapists, the outcome assessor can and always should be blinded.</P>
<P>The outcome measures in the studies described in our review were diverse, and several were not validated. The use of reliable and valid outcome measures is essential in order to reduce bias, provide precise measures and allow for comparisons across trials. Disability-oriented outcomes such as 'return-to-work', 'activities of daily living' and 'function' were rarely reported. We suggest these be included in future studies.</P>
<P>Our approach to summarizing the literature has several strengths. We conducted a comprehensive, librarian-assisted search of multiple databases. A minimum of two people extracted data, while the principal investigator verified data entry. In addition, to minimize bias, we used a group consensus approach coupled with the Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 2000</LINK>) and Van Tulder (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>) hierarchy on the strength of the evidence.</P>
<P>The weakness of this review rests with limitations of the primary studies. We were unable to make any firm statements about the strength of the evidence due to four cardinal limitations of the studies: (a) number of studies that were of low methodological quality; (b) the majority of studies used massage as one component in a multimodal treatment but failed to use a research design such as a factorial design that could ascertain the relative contribution of massage; (c) no study provided pilot data justifying the minimal effective 'amount' of massage (frequency, duration, dose, technique), thus there is little information on what constitutes a beneficial amount of massage and (d) many studies were underpowered but could not be pooled due to heterogeneous populations, massage techniques, treatment combinations and control groups.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last Cochrane review update (<LINK REF="REF-Haraldsson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haraldsson 2006a</LINK>), 15 trials relating to massage were reviewed for the current Cochrane review. As of yet, there has not been an established ideal massage therapy approach to managing cervical pain both specific and non-specific.</P>
<P>The most commonly treated disorder type was specific myofascial pain or non-specific neck pain with positive trigger points. Different forms of &#8220;massage&#8221; were compared with a placebo, to no treatment or to an adjunct treatment. Our systematic review did not find strong or moderate levels of evidence for massage alone relative to a control.</P>
<P>When massage was compared with no treatment or placebo treatment, there was no difference found in pain intensity (<LINK REF="STD-Blikstad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blikstad 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Briem-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Briem 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gemmell-2008-_x0028_p-30_x002d_36_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gemmell 2008 (p 30-36)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanten-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hanten 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irnich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Irnich 2001</LINK>). Low level evidence showed that Traditional Chinese massage was better at improving function than no treatment for patients with subacute/chronic neck pain (<LINK REF="STD-Cen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Classical and modified-strain/counter-strain massage improved pain tenderness in the immediate term (<LINK REF="STD-Meseguer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Meseguer 2006</LINK>). However, the low levels of evidence in these studies due to poor methodological quality preclude making any generalisable statement about the effectiveness of massage even when massage has been found to be superior to control.</P>
<P>There is no difference in pain intensity, physical function and quality of life when massage is compared with other therapies such as manual therapy, acupuncture, education, exercise and multimodal intervention. However, studies that compare one active treatment versus another active treatment require larger sample sizes than studies that compare an active treatment with a placebo.  Thus, it is impossible to determine whether the 'no difference&#8217; findings in the studies comparing active treatment with active treatment reflect true equivalence or merely sample sizes too small to detect a difference. No difference was found when different massage therapy techniques were compared among each other (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gemmell-2008-_x0028_p-30_x002d_36_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gemmell 2008 (p 30-36)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostopoulous-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kostopoulous 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Even when statistical significance was found, such as an improvement in pain with the combination of ischaemic compression and passive stretch compared with individual treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kostopoulous-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kostopoulous 2008</LINK>), the lack of replicability of the study precludes making a statement about the effectiveness of one massage technique over another.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The application of the massage techniques can be remarkably different in research trials relative to how it is applied in clinical practice. A standardised taxonomy continues to be needed for massage. Although one has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2006</LINK>), there is no movement to adopt this within the research community.</P>
<P>Beyond the normal methodological quality issues, such as proper randomisation and blinding that are indispensable in all randomised trials, massage trials present additional challenges.  In these studies, often only the frequency of the intervention was reported. Yet, treatment parameters need to be detailed beyond treatment frequency (sessions per week) and should include the type of massage, the duration of a massage session, and the intensity or grade/depth of pressure at a minimum. There also needs to be detailing of the technique and the prior experience and training of clinician, as this could be a valuable source of heterogeneity and affect outcomes. In practice, practitioners use a broad range of treatment approaches and may treat patients for a longer time. This means that for studies to reflect practice, the studies may need to combine treatment approaches using factorial designs, also treat and follow up patients for longer periods of time.</P>
<P>Measures that promote rigor in clinical trials such as careful control of the intervention may produce results that are less relevant for clinicians in typical practice and decision makers.</P>
<P>For example, the timing of the outcomes measurement in the sequence of care immediately post-treatment may not be optimal to depict the effect of massage on outcome domains. It may be clinically relevant to measure outcomes days after the treatment, or after multiple treatments.  Moyer et al makes the case for assessing outcomes after multiple treatments by noting in their meta-analysis of massage studies that there was no effect on pain immediately after a single massage, but significant pain reduction days to weeks after multiple massage (<LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, Moyer and colleagues&#8217; meta-analysis challenges  an assumption that immediate post-treatment is the only interval where a biologic effect occurs; thus, biologically based paradigms for measuring outcomes may need to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2004</LINK>). Additionally, Moyer's meta-analysis found no significant trend based on the duration of a session, and thus  emphasize that neither the optimal frequency nor duration of massage treatments for pain reduction and the &#8220;decay&#8221; in analgesic effect on pain is yet known. Further research in establishing these parameters would immensely benefit future massage trials.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-09 10:36:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following represents a key feature of concern to massage. The majority of the studies were rated &#8220;high risk&#8221; in regards to blinding. One bias inherent in all trials is that blinding of patient, care provider, and often outcome assessor was often not achieved and can lead to exaggerated treatment effect estimates. Blinding of the therapist is not possible, so significant effort to blinding the outcome assessor is needed. In most studies reported in this review, the primary outcome is a &#8220;self-report&#8221; outcome such as pain, global perceived effect, disability/function or quality of life, in other words a &#8220;subjective&#8221; outcome type.</P>
<P>The bottom-line is that blinding is impossible for some procedures unless a viable placebo procedure exists. The care giver cannot be blinded. The outcome assessor may in main outcomes like pain be &#8220;the patient&#8221; and cannot be blinded to their previous score, especially if the timing of the outcome immediately post-treatment or at short-term follow-up.</P>
<P>In addition, the reporting of outcomes for most of the trials was rated &#8220;unclear,&#8221; with the exception of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gemmell-2008-_x0028_p-30_x002d_36_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gemmell 2008 (p 30-36)</LINK>). The majority of the studies did not have a previously published (and referenced in the current paper) protocol initiated prior to the start of the study.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our approach to summarising the literature has several strengths. We conducted a comprehensive, librarian-assisted search of multiple databases.  A minimum of two people extracted data, and the principal investigator verified data entry. In addition, we used a group consensus approach coupled with 'Risk of bias' analysis to minimise bias and gain internal validity of the included studies. The external validity of the studies was assessed using GRADE analysis.</P>
<P>The weakness of this paper rests with limitations of the primary studies. The majority of studies were of high risk of bias; no study provided pilot data justifying the minimal effective &#8220;amount&#8221; of massage (frequency, duration, dose, technique) thus there is little information as to what constitutes a beneficial amount of massage; and many studies were underpowered but could not be pooled. Difficulties arose due to heterogeneous populations and perhaps inappropriate &#8220;weighting&#8221; of variables. The majority of the studies used pain tenderness as an outcome measure and assessed only the immediate post-treatment effect of a single application of treatment, which is not clinically relevant. The studies were heterogeneous in the types of massage technique that were used, and there were only single low level trials on massage technique. Thus, it was hard to determine the effectiveness of those treatments. In the study by <LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2011</LINK>, it was found that the treatment effects of single centre trials were larger than the effects of large scale multicentre trials. Taking into account that the trials used in the <LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2011</LINK> study had large sample size compared to the trials used in our review, we should be cautious of our results as they were mostly single centre trials with extremely small sample size.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-11 11:29:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the review of reviews, multiple reviews showed no difference or no benefits when massage was compared with other treatments such as acupuncture, education and exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Haraldsson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haraldsson 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK>). These results are consistent with the results of our review. The review <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK> is the most recent review done on Massage therapy for neck pain. The recommendations of the <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK> review state that there is low grade evidence that massage is more effective in reducing pain than control or placebo treatment. This recommendation contrasts from the results of our review. This contrast is because our review has excluded a few studies that <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK> had included. Along with that, though both reviews included the study <LINK REF="STD-Blikstad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blikstad 2008</LINK>, our review considered the activator trigger point therapy as a form of manipulation while <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2010</LINK> considered it as a massage therapy technique. Clinical applicability was not assessed in any of the other previous reviews, but it was assessed in our review.</P>
<P>The previous version of this<I> </I>Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Haraldsson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haraldsson 2006a</LINK>) and review by <LINK REF="REF-Ezzo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzo 2007</LINK> , which is a precursor to the Cochrane review, noted limited implications for clinical practice. No recommendations could be made due to unclear evidence and the difficulty in comparing remarkably different massage forms. Four different massage therapy approaches, all in trials of very low quality and of moderate clinical applicability showed evidence of no benefit in pain relief when compared to different forms of control. The trials within these two reviews included ischaemic compression; the use of a J-cane tool; Western massage; and occipital release for typically subacute or chronic neck pain.</P>
<P>Most commonly, there was no uniform definition, no definition of the massage technique and no related dosage. This latter finding was also observed in our review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the review showed that certain massage techniques (traditional Chinese massage, classical and modified strain/counterstrain technique) were more effective than control or placebo treatment for improving function and tenderness. Massage was also more beneficial than education in the short term for pain bothersomeness. Along with that, it was also found that ischaemic compression and passive stretch are more effective in combination rather that individually for pain reduction. These results are not clinically applicable as they only looked at the immediate post-treatment effect on clinically irrelevant outcome measures such as pain tenderness and bothersomeness. Due to the limitations of existing studies, we are unable to make any firm statement to guide clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-09 19:07:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Massage was primarily applied for a single session and immediate effect on outcomes was measured which does not match typical practice. Short-, intermediate- and long term-term are needed. There is a need to assess more global outcome measures that patients can relate to such as physical function and quality of life rather than considering outcomes such as pain intensity or tenderness. Pilot trials characterising the massage treatment including the frequency, duration, number of sessions, and massage technique are needed. The optimal massage treatment to be used in subsequent larger trials must be established.  Along with that, future trials should adequately report on the qualification of the practitioner providing massage. Factorial design including randomisation first to massage or no treatment, and then randomising to other treatment modalities would prove most informative to delineate the additive/subtractive and individual effect of massage to any given treatment combination. The Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool is based on six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias; vigilance to these domains must underpin future trials.   </P>

Pressure was applied slowly, maintained and released slowly. pressure was applied perpendicular to longitudinal axis of muscles and tendons. pressure was less than what would excite a muscle and was applied at an increasingly deeper level. Amount of pressure was individualised according to therapist perception of the patient's tolerance as reflected by muscle response.</P>

<B>Low quality:</B> Ischaemic compression is no different than passive stretch to UFT in reduction of pain intensity at short-term follow-up. Combination of Ischaemic compression and passive stretch to UFT is better in reducing pain intensity when compared with Ischaemic compression and passive stretch individually at short-term follow-up. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Random sequence generation (selection bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots, minimization (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random).</P>
<P>There is a high risk of selection bia<I>s</I> if the investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process, such as: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by judgment of the clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, or availability of the intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment (selection bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of selection bias if the participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.</P>

<UL>
<LI>for patient-reported outcomes in which the patient was the outcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2005</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care providers (e.g. co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2005</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: there is a low risk of bias if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2005</LINK>).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>There is a low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if drop-outs are very large, imputation using even 'acceptable' methods may still suggest a high risk of bias) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>). The percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias (these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by literature) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</P>
<P>There is a high risk of reporting bias<I> </I>if<I> </I>not all of the study's pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bias due to inappropriate compliance with interventions across groups</HEADING>
<P>There is low risk of bias if compliance with the interventions was acceptable, based on the reported intensity/dosage, duration, number and frequency for both the index and control intervention(s). For single-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>

When all studies are included in the meta-analysis, &#8216;consistency&#8217; is defined as absence of statistical heterogeneity. In the case that not all studies are combined in a meta-analysis, &#8216;consistency&#8217; is defined when all studies for the specific outcome lead to the same decision or recommendation, and  &#8216;inconsistency&#8217; is present if the results of two or more studies lead to clinically different decisions or recommendations. Authors use their judgment to decide if there is inconsistency when only one study leads to clinically different decision or recommendation.</P>
<P>
<B>Directness (generalizability) </B>refers to the extent to which the people, interventions and outcome measures are similar to those of interest.</P>
<P>
<B>Precision </B>of the evidence relates to the number of studies, patients and events for each outcome. Imprecise data is defined as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Only one study for an outcome, regardless of the sample size or the confidence interval</LI>
<LI>Multiple studies combined in a meta-analysis: the confidence interval is sufficiently wide that the estimate is consistent with conflicting recommendations. For rare events one should consider the confidence interval around the risk difference rather than the confidence interval around the relative risk</LI>
<LI>Multiple studies not combined in a meta-anlaysis: the total sample size is underpowered to detect a clinically significant difference between those who received the index intervention compared to those who received the control intervention. In this case, a post-hoc sample size calculation should be performed to determine the adequate sample size for each outcome</LI>

<P>
<B>Reporting (Publication) bias </B>should only be considered present if there is actual evidence of reporting bias rather than only speculation about reporting bias. The Cochrane Reporting Bias Methods Group describes the following types of Reporting Bias and Definitions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Publication Bias: the publication or non publication of research findings, depending on the nature and direction of the results.</LI>
<LI>Time Lag Bias: the rapid or delayed publication of research findings, depending on the nature and direction of the results.</LI>
<LI>Language Bias: the publication of research findings in a particular language, depending on the nature and direction of the results.</LI>
<LI>Funding Bias: the reporting of research findings, depending on how the results accord with the aspirations of the funding body.</LI>
<LI>Outcome Variable Selection Bias: the selective reporting of some outcomes but not others, depending on the nature and direction of the research findings.</LI>
<LI>Developed Country Biases: the non publication or non indication of findings, depending on whether the authors were based in developed or in developing countries.</LI>
