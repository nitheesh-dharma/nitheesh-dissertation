<P>Carbamazepine is the most commonly used drug to treat partial epileptic seizures. Oxcarbazepine is a newer drug that was developed with the intention to be as effective as carbamazepine but to cause fewer side effects. In this systematic review, we summarise three studies in which oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine treatment were compared directly. We found that both drugs appear to be equally effective and to cause side effects equally often. Significantly fewer patients on carbamazepine developed nausea or vomiting during treatment.</P>

<P>Three trials (723 participants) were included.

There was no overall difference in time to treatment withdrawal between the two drugs (hazard ratio (HR) of oxcarbazepine (OXC) versus carbamazepine (CBZ): 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.39). Further analyses showed no significant difference in treatment withdrawal for unacceptable side effects (HR of OXC versus CBZ: 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.24) and in treatment withdrawal for inadequate seizure control (HR of OXC versus CBZ: 1.33, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.15). Oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine appeared to be similarly effective and well tolerated although the confidence intervals around estimates were wide and do not rule out the possibility of important differences existing. Significantly fewer patients on carbamazepine treatment developed nausea or vomiting, or both (odds ratio of OXC versus CBZ: 3.15, 95% CI 1.39 to 7.14).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-30 10:42:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is common clinical practice to treat patients with partial onset seizures with the well established antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ). Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is a newer antiepileptic drug derived from CBZ with the intention to reduce side effects and drug interactions, while maintaining equal efficacy. It has been claimed that OXC causes fewer side effects and fewer allergic reactions than CBZ (<LINK REF="REF-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorvon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tecoma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tecoma 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another theoretical advantage of OXC is a difference in the metabolism of the two drugs. CBZ is metabolised via the hepatic cytochrome-P450 enzyme system, and leads to an increase in the expression (induction) of these enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2004</LINK>). OXC on the other hand does not induce changes in this enzyme system and, thus, may theoretically cause fewer drug interactions.</P>
<P>It is currently unknown whether these theoretical considerations have any relevant clinical consequences and whether treatment decisions should be based on them. In this systematic review, we examine randomised trials comparing the two drugs with regard to efficacy and tolerability.<BR/>

<U>)</U> randomised a total of 1721 patients with epilepsy to either CBZ (378), gabapentin (377), lamotrigine (378), OXC (210), or topiramate (378). The inclusion criteria stated that patients had to have a history of two or more definite unprovoked epileptic seizures in the year previous to randomisation and that CBZ was deemed the better standard treatment option, compared to valproate, by the recruiting physician. Patients were excluded if all their seizures had been acute symptomatic seizures, if they were four years of age or younger, or if there was a history of progressive neurological disease. Drug titration, initial maintenance dose and any increments or decrements were decided by the clinician, just as in everyday practice, aided by guidelines. Patients were seen for follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months, and at successive yearly intervals from the date of randomisation. Occurrence of seizures, adverse events and hospital admissions were documented. When patients ceased visiting the hospital clinics, follow-up was done by the general practitioner or by a telephone interview. The SANAD trial was the only included trial using the same efficacy measures we selected for this review. Therefore, the analyses on efficacy are based solely on this trial.</P>
<P>Donati and coworkers (<LINK REF="STD-Donati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Donati 2007</LINK>) performed an unblinded trial on the effect of three antiepileptic drugs on cognition in children and adolescents and randomised a total of 112 patients to either OXC (n = 55), CBZ (n = 28) or valproate (n = 29). Drug titration, initial maintenance dose and any increments or decrements were decided by the clinician, just as in everyday practice, aided by the prescribing information for the drug in question. Patients were followed for six months. Outcomes regarding cognition were the difference in performance in the Computerised Visual Searching Task and several additional measures of psychomotor speed, alertness, memory, learning and non-verbal intelligence. Further outcomes were the number of patients remaining seizure free during follow-up and the number of adverse events. The percentage of patients remaining seizure free during follow-up was comparable between the OXC group (32 of 55 patients (58%) seizure free) and CBZ group (13 of 28 patients (46%) seizure free). Since the efficacy outcome used in this trial differed from those we selected for this review, and in view of the relatively short duration of the trial, we decided not to seek individual patient data for inclusion in time-to-event regression models but limited our analyses to the adverse events data from this trial.</P>
<P>One trial including 52 children with partial epilepsy had been published in abstract form (<A HREF="file:///c:%5cdocuments%20and%20settings%5csuus%5cbureaublad%5coxcarbazepine%20versus%20carbamazepine%20monotherapy%20for%20partial%20onset%20seizures.htm#std-dizdarer-2000#std-dizdarer-2000">Dizdarer 2000</A>). Children up to the age of 15 with more than two partial onset seizures were included in this trial. Patients with a structural brain lesion were excluded from the study. The trial was unblinded and had two treatment groups. After randomisation, patients received either CBZ in increasing doses to 20 mg/kg/day after three to four days, or OXC to 30 mg/kg/day after three to four days. Patients were assessed at 1, 2 and 3 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. A diary, completed by the patients and their parents, was applied to monitor side-effects. The mean follow-up period was 15.4 months in the CBZ group and 15.6 months in the OXC group. The outcomes in this study were the number of patients remaining seizure-free during follow-up and the number of adverse events. For this trial, individual patient data on efficacy measures were no longer available, but data on adverse events were provided by the study authors.</P>

There were no significant differences between OXC and CBZ in the occurrence of allergic rash (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>), dizziness or vertigo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>) and headache (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). There was a trend towards a clinical advantage of OXC in the occurrence of fatigue/drowsiness/sedation (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>) but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). There were significantly fewer occurrences of nausea or vomiting, or both, among patients using CBZ, which suggests a clinical advantage of CBZ over OXC (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.39 to 7.14 <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).</P>
<P>We detected no significant heterogeneity between the trials in any of these analyses (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P &gt; 0.10 in all analyses).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 11:04:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three randomised controlled trials included in this review were unblinded. Only one trial used adequate outcome measures of efficacy;therefore, the results pertaining to efficacy are based on a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Marson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Marson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regard to the efficacy of the treatments, there were no significant differences between CBZ and OXC in the time to treatment withdrawal (overall), in the time to treatment withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control, in the time to the first seizure post randomisation or in the time to 12-month remission from seizures.</P>
<P>The tolerability of the two treatments was comparable: there were no significant differences in the time to treatment withdrawal due to unacceptable adverse events, or in the overall number of adverse events. Significantly fewer patients allocated to CBZ treatment experienced nausea or vomiting, which suggests an advantage of CBZ over OXC for this particular outcome.</P>
<P>In summary, our analyses suggest that CBZ and OXC have a similar efficacy and tolerability in patients with partial onset seizures, but the confidence intervals are wide and do not rule out the possibility of important differences existing. There is currently no evidence to suggest that either drug is superior to the other.</P>

<P>CBZ and OXC appear to be equally effective in the treatment of partial onset seizures, and are equally well tolerated; but confidence intervals are wide and do not exclude the possibility of important differences existing. There is currently no evidence to suggest that either drug is superior to the other. There was a significant advantage of CBZ over OXC in the occurrence of nausea or vomiting on treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:51:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analyses of efficacy and adverse events depend solely, and largely respectively, on a single large trial which was not specifically designed to compare OXC and CBZ. While the two drugs appear similar in efficacy and tolerability, the confidence intervals are wide and do not rule out the possibility of important differences between OXC and CBZ. Further studies comparing the efficacy and tolerability of OXB and CBZ are justified.</P>
