<TITLE>Diaphragm compared to diaphragm with spermicide for birth control</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-20 21:03:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The diaphragm is an important type of birth control. The woman controls the method and it does not involve taking a drug. Also, the birth control can be reversed right away. The diaphragm is often used with a spermicide - a chemical to kill sperm. Many women feel that the spermicide is awkward and messy to use. Spermicides may increase the risk of infections in the urinary tract. Some health care workers think that spermicide does not help with birth control.</P>
<P>This review looked at trials of diaphragms used with and without spermicide. We looked at how well each method worked, how safe it was, and whether women liked using it.</P>
<P>We did computer searches for randomized trials that compared the diaphragm only to the diaphragm with spermicide. We also looked at reference lists to find trials. In addition, we wrote to researchers to find more studies.</P>
<P>We found one trial that looked at using the diaphragm with and without the spermicide. Of the women who used the diaphragm only, slightly more got pregnant than did those who used the diaphragm with spermicide. The study was too small to know how well the spermicide worked with the diaphragm for birth control. Large trials would help to address this issue. Current evidence gives no reason to change the practice of using spermicide with the diaphragm.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The diaphragm is usually used with a spermicide. However, some practitioners have suggested that spermicides offer no additional contraceptive protection and have advocated alternative guidelines for the use of diaphragms.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-01-20 20:59:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials comparing women of reproductive age using the diaphragm with and without spermicide. The diaphragm had to be the sole contraceptive method, and the report had to include clinical outcomes.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-01-20 21:00:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data on outcomes and trial characteristics. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by consultation with a third author. The results of the one identified study are presented descriptively.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-01-20 21:00:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We identified only one study. No significant difference was found in the pregnancy rates (with typical use or consistent use) or discontinuation rates between the diaphragm-with-spermicide and diaphragm-without-spermicide groups. A trend toward higher pregnancy rates was noted in the diaphragm-without-spermicide group. However, this study failed to recruit the planned number of participants and was consequently underpowered.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-20 21:02:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>As only one underpowered study was identified, we cannot distinguish between the contraceptive effectiveness of the diaphragm with and without spermicide. We cannot draw any conclusion at this point. Randomized controlled trials with adequate numbers of participants would be required to adequately examine this issue. However, the study provides no evidence to change the commonly recommended practice of using the diaphragm with spermicide.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-12 16:11:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The diaphragm is an important woman-controlled, immediately reversible, low-risk method of contraception. Standard practice is to use the diaphragm in conjunction with a spermicidal cream or jelly (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The proportion of women using this method is low and has been falling, with an estimated 1% of women using vaginal contraception worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-PDUN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">PDUN 1996</LINK>). The diaphragm's limited acceptance is due to several factors, in particular, the availability of more effective forms of contraception. Another factor deterring use may be the adjunctive use of spermicide. Many women find spermicides inconvenient and messy. In addition, spermicides may increase the risk of cystitis by altering normal vaginal flora, which allows overgrowth of pathogenic strains of <I>E. coli </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Fihn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fihn 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In response, some practitioners have advocated use of the diaphragm without spermicide, suggesting that spermicides offer no additional contraceptive protection (<LINK REF="REF-Stim-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stim 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 1993</LINK>). Other variations on standard diaphragm use have been advocated, such as continuous wearing of the diaphragm (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 1993</LINK>) or a one-size fits all 'free-fit' diaphragm (<LINK REF="REF-Stim-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stim 1980</LINK>). However, the reported pregnancy rates of women using this method have been widely variable (<LINK REF="REF-Stim-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stim 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clarification of the contribution of spermicides to the contraceptive effectiveness of the diaphragm would aid women and practitioners in the decision concerning adjunctive use of spermicides.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-03-02 22:05:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Only one trial was identified which fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bounds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bounds 1995</LINK>). The objective of this trial was to compare the contraceptive effectiveness of three methods: diaphragm-without-spermicide versus diaphragm-with-spermicide versus spermicide-only over a 12-month period of use. Randomization to the spermicide-only arm was discontinued early in the course of the study, as it was identified as a hindrance to recruitment. Potential participants were then given the option of choosing the spermicide-alone intervention before randomization. Randomization codes were generated for the two remaining groups. Only the diaphragm-without-spermicide and the diaphragm-with-spermicide arms were considered in this review. The planned study size was 144 women per group to provide 0.80 power to detect a 14% absolute difference in pregnancy rates between the two arms. The report did not include the rates used as the basis for this calculation. The trial was terminated early due to recruitment difficulties. The trial recruited 164 participants: 84 in the diaphragm-without-spermicide arm and 80 in the diaphragm-with-spermicide arm.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The allocation sequence was computer generated, and allocation concealment was by sequentially-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes (researcher communication). The participants, investigators and the outcome assessors were not masked. An a priori power calculation was reported. There were no known exclusions after randomization. The loss to follow up was low (0.5% at 12 months). </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-01-20 20:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The trial found no significant differences in pregnancy or discontinuation rates between the two arms:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The 12-month cumulative pregnancy rate per 100 women for typical use for diaphragm-without-spermicide was 28.6 (95% CI 17.4 to 39.8), and for diaphragm-with-spermicide the rate was 21.2 (95% CI 11.0 to 31.4).</LI>
<LI>The 12-month cumulative pregnancy rate per 100 women for consistent use for diaphragm-without-spermicide was 19.3 (95% CI 7.5 to 31.1), and for diaphragm-with-spermicide the rate was 12.3 (95% CI 2.8 to 21.8). Consistent use was defined as no unprotected intercourse and use of only the assigned method.</LI>
<LI>Three related adverse events were reported, and all were described as vaginal or vulvar irritation attributed to candidiasis. All were in the diaphragm-without-spermicide arm.</LI>
<LI>The discontinuation rates were high, but not significantly different between the arms. The 12-month cumulative total discontinuation rate per 100 women was 57.2 (95% CI 46.6 to 67.8) for the diaphragm-without-spermicide group, and it was 49.2 (95% CI 38.2 to 60.2) for the diaphragm-with-spermicide group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-20 20:24:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Only one trial was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Bounds-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bounds 1995</LINK>), and it was underpowered. The effectiveness of the diaphragm in this trial was poor, with or without use of a spermicide. The failure rates of 21% to 29% were higher than U.S. estimates for first-year failure of 16% for typical use and 6% for perfect use (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2007</LINK>). The researchers proposed this could be due to characteristics of the participants. These women differed from women in other studies in that they were more likely living with a partner, more likely to be spacing pregnancies (rather than limiting them), and less likely to be using additional forms of contraception. Therefore, these women might have been at higher risk of pregnancy. The researchers also proposed that the high follow-up rate in this study could have led to more identified pregnancies than in studies with lower follow-up rates.</P>
<P>This study did not find a significant difference in pregnancy rates (with typical use or consistent use) or in discontinuation rates between the groups (diaphragm-with-spermicide and diaphragm-without-spermicide). However, the trial failed to recruit the planned number of participants and was consequently underpowered. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the relative contraceptive effectiveness of the diaphragm-with-spermicide compared to diaphragm-without-spermicide.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-03-02 21:55:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We did not find a significant difference in pregnancy rates or discontinuation rates between the diaphragm-with-spermicide and diaphragm-without-spermicide groups. The study was underpowered, and therefore provides insufficient evidence to change the commonly recommended practice of using the diaphragm with spermicide.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-20 21:01:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Randomized controlled trials with adequate numbers of participants would be required to establish whether or not the diaphragm used without spermicide is as effective a contraceptive as a diaphragm used with spermicide. Further trials may be logistically difficult, since the prevalence of diaphragm use is low worldwide. In addition, they may be considered ethically questionable given the direction of the difference observed in the one identified study.</P>
