We have reviewed your comments/suggestions and made alterations where necessary with track changes activated to make reviewing these changes more visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see my comments to each point below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks again,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 April 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC added edits April 3rd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added information on absolute treatment effects in the abstract and results and also changed the SoF table to use the new wording and clarify the reasons that I think there is only moderate certainty in the results for exacerbations and hospitalisations. Please add units as requested. (Thanks Chris, added. We have amended the results regarding the time to first exacerbation as per your note in the document, however we could not add all statistics as the authors did not publish but stated)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma D notes 12/04/2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Helen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your work updating this priority review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like it is written for a broad audience. The information could be better explained by rearranging under the headings. For example, the description of the condition rather than explaining about asthma and then eosinophil mediated asthma, talks about treatment to prevent exacerbations and goes on to talk about outcome measures. If the part about eosinophilic vs neutrophilic asthma was included here, then the rest would follow much easier. Description of the intervention could be simplified to make it clear that the intervention is screening for eosinophilic inflammation and then using this to determine what treatment is given instead of the conventional approach with an assessment of the clinical symptoms to make a treatment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Background section now revised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;In people with asthma, the percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum is significantly higher than that in non-asthmatic patients&amp;quot; is this correct? A thorax paper says that around 50% of people's asthma is mediated by eosinophils (Douwes 2002).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have removed the &amp;quot;significantly&amp;quot; however this sentence is referring to the number of sputum eosinophils in people with asthma in comparison to controls/&amp;quot;non-asthmatic patients&amp;quot;. This sentence is not referring to non-eosinophilic asthma versus eosinophilic asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No mention of allergy/atopy in the background - is that relevant in defining or at least describing the population? It may help users to determine the applicability of the review to themselves?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding allergy/atopy is not relevant for this as this review refers to cell counts in sputum and nothing to do with atopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include description of induced sputum and bronchiolar lavage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A description of induced sputum has been added, however as this intervention is not on bronchoalveolar lavage we have not included a description for bronchoscopy and BAL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;Thus, a systematic review evaluating the efficacy of tailoring asthma interventions based on sputum analysis (sputum strategy, SS) in comparison with the traditional reliance primarily on clinical symptoms of asthma (CS) will be useful to guide clinical practice&amp;#8221; and help people with asthma decide if they want to undertake the procedure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sentence has changed but not to your suggestion as the physician would be the first to decide if sputum induction would be suitable for a patient. It is very labour intensive and can only be attended in specialised units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Percentage of eosinophils &amp;#8211; would be good to specify that it is the percentage in the sputum. By weight? Or cell count?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, very good point and we have added this into the background in the description of sputum induction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace 'classical asthma'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, that was from the original review 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outcomes are a bit strange &amp;#8220;MD in asthma related outcomes measures&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; this could be anything!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, this needed changing as from the original protocol. Therefore we have changed and acknowledged in the change from protocol section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbering of the outcomes in the results section doesn&amp;#8217;t correspond with anything and adds confusion. Please remove the numbers from the headings. Heading font styles must be selected from the drop-down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number have been removed and the headings are from the drop-down box (Heading 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SS strategy &amp;#8211; what anti-inflam treatment used in Cao 2007, Green 2002, Chlumsky 2006 and Fleming 2012? Seems to be ICS from the table. Would be helpful to state what ICS in the table&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry Emma, this is not possible as the articles do not specifically say which ICS each patient is on but their doses have been converted to dosage equivalent. Most publications which include ICS will report dosage this way. The importance is in making sure that when combining the ICS data that the ICS is all reported in the same equivalence. For this review we made it budesonide equivalent dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;described a significant reduction in various aspects of asthma exacerbations&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; this is unclear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks - removed &amp;quot;various aspects&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The primary outcome has been expanded from proportion of people experience one or more exacerbations to include occurrence of any exacerbation and time to first exacerbation. This needs to be marked as a change from protocol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amended the outcomes and made a note of this in the change from protocol section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Were the differences clinically meaningful as well as statistically significant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, reductions in asthma exacerbations are clinically meaningful which is described further in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data and analyses - turn off totals where there is only one study in the analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turned off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possible to add some basic information to the &amp;quot;characteristics of studies awaiting classification&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;characteristics of ongoing studies &amp;quot;table? studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have re-checked these studies and searched for further information but could only find information regarding Sosa so have moved it to the excluded the studies. There is no further information available on the other studies and as they are so old, we have removed them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be consistent with EOS/Eos etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EOS is a specific strategy of Chlumsky (included study) so I have not changed this but all other occasions are Eos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add study sponsor to the notes section in the characteristics of included studies table&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;risk of bias - would be better and easier (especially for future updates) to report separately for blinding of participants and personnel and outcomes assessors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have activated the separate RoB items and moved the information into these sections. I have since de-activated the combined RoB item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the text it says that the control group strategies are described in table 1. But I don&amp;#8217;t understand what the participants did or didn&amp;#8217;t experience from table 1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table 1 was an idea Chris had and has been incorporated into the 2 FeNO papers too. The purpose was to make it easier for the reader to see the differences between the included studies. Despite the studies fitting the inclusion criteria they are quite heterogenous in the strategies used for the intervention group and the control/symptom strategy. Some included studies utilised existing appropriate asthma guidelines and others did not. This table makes it clear as to the differences between the studies. The strategies are explained in the Characteristics of included studies section too. We have added the word &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; in the column title of &amp;quot;Sputum strategy&amp;quot;, if you think this makes it clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC stats check March 10:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have already checked the data extraction, so I have only made minor alterations to the results text. Please add the units for outcomes six and seven (steroid dose and cost) for the mean differences. Please add comments to the final two outcomes of the SoF table (where it says see comment) and the reasons for downgrading to the footnotes (e.g. downgraded by one point for risk of bias etc.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz S 10/03/2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have updated the search methods section to comply with the new style guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have updated appendix 2 with the Airways Register search strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=========&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC edits Feb 2015. Hi Helen, I have amended the Cates plots and NNT results to relate to risks over one year from the Green and Fleming studies. I have also updated the Summary of Findings tables, but cannot quite work out what is going on in the sensitivity analysis, now the review has been updated. Please can you check this section?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1st September 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen I have looked through the review and added the people with one or more exacerbations from Chlumsky using the Kaplan Meier plot. I have added a couple of Cates plots as figures and used these to update the Summary of Findings tables. I thought the first two outcomes were moderate quality (in the SoF table), because the removal of data from the open study makes little difference to these results! You do not need to keep both Cates plots unless you want to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all yours to update the rest of the text to match the changes in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chirs, I have to adjust Chlumsky exacerbations. I found a mistake while I was writing the paper combining the 2 tailored interventions Cochrane's. The N was around the wrong way. I have changed to the correct way. Sorry about the incorrect information. I don't know how it got by both Anne and myself. It doesn't change the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC final edit Feb2nd&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the swift response to the peer reviewer. I have merely rephrased the comment about authors not responding - Toby can give you the contact email for updating.&lt;br&gt;This is now ready for submission and should be published in Issue 2, 2007. I have run spell check, tidied the new references and left my minor amendment in red.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses from HP &amp;amp; AC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.Generally the abstract is fine and presents the results fairly. The background of the abstract implies that sputum eosinophil counts may be useful as they are an objective measure and may be &amp;quot;more sensitive than subjective measures&amp;quot;, suggesting that symptoms and spirometry may be subjective. Whilst sputum eosinophil counts are of course objective, their major advantage is that they also measure something different to symptoms / spirometry - i.e. directly measure airway inflammation. This point is also not entirely clearly made in the background session of the main manuscript: &amp;quot;markers of airway inflammation ...may be more sensitive markers than subjective measures and better than traditional objective measures&amp;quot;: I agree but markers of airway inflammation are measuring a different aspect of asthma control than markers of symptoms or lung function, so there is more than just objectivity/subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Response: We have altered the abstract and reworded the background a little. While we agree that inflammation is a measure of a different aspect of asthma, in the end, whatever aspect of asthma it measures is still an objective test and symptoms are still subjective. It's a bit like the argument that QOL measures a different aspect of asthma control. Irrespectively it's still an subjective assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.The discussion is clear and does accurately reflect the results of the analysis. The authors suggest that the Jayaram findings suggest that this technique may not be useful in areas with high levels of neutrophilic inflammation (e.g. pollution / viruses). This needs clarifying a little and referencing. Sputum management may not reduce exacerbation frequency in subjects with neutrophilic exacerbations but subgroup analysis from the Green study suggests that non-eosinophilic patients may require less anti-inflammatory treatment with sputum monitoring, this is not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Response: We have added the reference on neutrophilic asthma and viral infection and exposure. We have also added a few sentences in to reflect the above:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Subgroup analysis from Green and colleagues study reported that patients with non-eospinophilic inflammation had a reduction in daily inhaled corticosteriods at the end of the study in comparison with baseline when using the sputum strategy. Whereas, the BTS management group had an increase in daily inhaled corticosteriods [&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Green 2002a&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Green 2002a&lt;/a&gt;]. However, there no no overall reduction in overall mean dose of ICS or oral corticosteroids (Outcomes 04.01 and 04.02).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.Under the description of studies, there appears the statement &amp;quot;Further information was requested from the authors to allow data to be entered into RevMan for meta-analysis. No authors replied to requests for further information regarding their published data.&amp;quot; As one of the authors of the studies I can confirm that I have not been contacted for further data and would be happy to provide whatever is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Response: Each corresponding author was contacted, ie. Ian Pavord from Green et al, Fred Hargreave from Jayaram et al, and Elena Bacci from Chlumsky. For 2007 update we will contact the reviewer, but will require contact details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================&lt;br&gt;Peer Review Comments Jan 30&lt;br&gt;Generally very positive but please respond to the suggestions below:&lt;br&gt;1. Generally the abstract is fine and presents the results fairly. The background of the abstract implies that sputum eosinophil counts may be useful as they are an objective measure and may be &amp;quot;more sensitive than subjective measures&amp;quot;, suggesting that symptoms and spirometry may be subjective.

These are really different outcomes on the same patients and no statistical comparison should be made between these two outcomes at all (it would be like comparing FEV1 and PEF in the same group of patients). Thanks for clarifying where the data comes from. I have been through outcome 1 and changed the GIV input to LN (natural logs). This now matches the published results in the papers as far as I can see. I have also used the published p values or confidence intervals to back-calculate the SE as the handbook method is not very reliable in comparison to the analysis of covariance etc used by the authors. The SE using the handbook method was not a good match to the published results in the papers, and assumptions about uniform exacerbation rates are unlikely to be met.&lt;br&gt;I have also checked through and amended the GIV inputs for comparison 2-4 and again altered the SE to match the p values in the papers&lt;br&gt;I have altered the text to match the new results . I have amended the methods section to reflect the way the SEs have been entered and the new results but please check these. The subgroup differences are not significant and I think the point about the eosinophilic exacerbations is that this shows where most of the benefit lies. A statistical test is not sensible for this.&lt;br&gt;This is a fairly major revision so please recheck thoroughly and let me know if you are happy with this version.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===========================&lt;br&gt;Email from Anne Chang: 02012007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby&lt;br&gt;Opps- you are right re: the first point. It should be rate ratios-sorry my error. Can you pls change it for us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;re: second point. am not quite sure what to do ie all can have eosinophilic exacerabtions or non-E exac. Thus N= number of people randomised in groups. For LABA it's different as they are either on or off LABA (ie can't have both) but for eos-exac all can be either. If it's incorrect, we can just remove that outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;anne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Toby Lasserson &amp;lt;tlassers@sgul.ac.uk&amp;gt; 29/12/2006 9:41:31 pm &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Hi Helen,&lt;br&gt;A couple of quick queries -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'(b) Frequency of any exacerbation (per participant-month) (Outcome 02)&lt;br&gt;Use of the SS significantly reduced frequency of exacerbations compared to CS, standardised mean difference of 0.73 (95% CI 0.57, 0.94). There was no significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2=0%, p=0.44).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metric you use is on the log scale rather than the continuous one - you can have a log scale for rate ratios (which I think is what you have put together here) but not for SMDs (which you have reported) - you would report SMD for outcomes where you have different scales (e.g. different symptom scores). In this instance I think that you are reporting rate ratios - Anne that was the sense I got from your email with the raw numbers a few weeks back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly:&lt;br&gt;'Rate of eosinophilic exacerbations were significantly less in SS than in CS (WMD -0.3, 95%CI -0.54, -0.06) but there was no difference between groups for non-eosinophilic exacerbations (WMD -0.19, 95%CI -0.39, 0.02).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the issue is more abouit unit of analysis - the N in the analysis should reflect the unit of analysis at the level of randomisation. Do the Ns here refer to the number of patients randomised, or the exacerbations that occured? The reason I ask is that in the other analyses for Jayaram the Ns in treatment and control are 18/21 and 32/31 for treatment and control participants defined by whether they were on LABA or not. In outcome 03:03 the Ns are 50 and 52 for both subgroups, implying that there were 200 participants randomised. This might explain why the SD for Sputum eos treated participants with eosinophilic exacerbations subgroup 01 is barely 2% of the SD for the clinical sx treated participants in the same subgroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you clarify the Ns issue above?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen Petsky wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Hi Toby,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Please find attached our revised review entitled, &amp;quot;Tailored interventions based on sputum eosinophils versus clinical symptoms for asthma in children and adults&amp;quot;. Also attached is our response to Chris.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; The review has had major changes including an extra study found by Susan in an updated search.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Happy New Year and thanks for all your help and support during 2006.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Kind regards,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Helen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;========================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC nov 14 Thanks for the hard work on this review - I am afraid that there is more to do- please see below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References : checked by Susan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Monthly exacerbation rates are not a dichotomous outcome and neither are 2~2 and 3~1. These need changing as it appears that there are more than 181 participants in these outcomes! Totals should also be switched off for single studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: May need revision after analysis is redone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: para in red should not be in the abstract as it is sub-group data from a single study. May need revision after analysis is redone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies: Definition of exacerbations seems to differ between studies. We normally use exacerbations requiring oral steroids. Can you obtain data on the number of patients who had an exacerbation of this definition from Jayaram to see how this differs from the first pooled comparison in the review? Number of exacerbations cannot be used in RevMan unless it comes as a rate per person with a standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results : &amp;quot;1. Exacerbation numbers (Comparison 01)&lt;br&gt;(a) Number of subjects who had one or more exacerbations during the study period (Outcome 01)&lt;br&gt;Meta-analysis from data combined from both studies showed that the number of subjects experiencing any exacerbation was significantly less (p=0.01) in the SS group than the CS group. Pooled OR estimate effect was 0.45 (95% CI 0.25, 0.82). The NNT was 6 (95% CI 4, 23).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;How is the exacerbation defined in each of the studies for this outcome please? I think Green is oral prednisolone but Jayaram is not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;(b) Number of exacerbations per person per month (Outcome 02)&lt;br&gt;The SS group experienced significantly less (p&amp;lt;0.00001) exacerbations per person per month than the CS group. Pooled OR estimate effect was 0.41 (95% CI 0.31, 0.55). The NNT =13 (95% CI 11, 17). There was significant heterogeneity and using the random effects model is described in the section 'sensitivity analyses'. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;This is incorrect and needs removing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2. Severity of exacerbation (Comparison 02)&lt;br&gt;(a) Hospitalisation (Outcome 01)&lt;br&gt;None of the subjects in Jayaram's study were hospitalised whereas 7 in Green's study were hospitalised. Combined data showed no difference between the groups (p=0.08) but favoured the SS group. Pooled OR estimate effect was 0.14 (95% CI 0.02, 1.26).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;This is not a pooled estimate as only one study contributes to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;(b) Number of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (Outcome 02)&lt;br&gt;Severity of exacerbations defined by requirement for rescue oral corticosteroids were not significant between groups, but favoured the SS group. Pooled OR estimate effect was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39, 1.36). &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Again there is a unit of analysis issue here as each person is being counted more than once. This is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;(a) Number of exacerbations per person per month based on asthma severity defined by requirement of ICS (Outcome 01)&lt;br&gt;(a1) Those with mild asthma (&amp;lt;250ug/day fluticasone equivalent)&lt;br&gt;There was no significant difference (p=0.8) between the groups when comparing the number of exacerbations in subjects with mild asthma (13 in SS group versus 11 exacerbations in CS group). OR was 1.12 (95% CI 0.49, 2.56)&lt;br&gt;(a2) Those with moderate to severe asthma (&amp;#179;250ug/day fluticasone equivalent)&lt;br&gt;In the sub-group of moderate to severe asthma there was a significant difference between groups (p=0.002) in the number of exacerbations per patient per month (34 in the SS group versus 68 exacerbations in CS group). OR was 0.50 (95% CI 0.33, 0.78). NNT =15 (95% CI 11, 34).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Same problem with unit of analysis as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Data from Jayaram and colleagues' study showed no difference between groups in subjects not on LABA but a significant difference between groups in those on LABA, favouring the SS group (mean difference of -0.7 (95% CI -1.36, -0.04). They additionally reported that the rate of first exacerbation was significantly reduced in the SS group compared to CS group in those on LABA (relative risk reduction of 60%, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18, 0.88) but there was no difference in those not on LABA. However, there was no difference between groups when multiple exacerbations were considered, as reported in the paper &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;The test for interaction between these subgroups does not show significant difference in the Metaview graph. Comparing p values in subgroups is not valid.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Drug treatment for asthma is usually guided by various measures, such as asthma symptoms and lung function tests. In this review we wanted to find out if it was more beneficial to guide treatment according to sputum eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that is increased in some forms of inflammation. The number of eosinophils in the sputum can tell us about levels of one type of inflammation in the lungs. We looked for evidence about whether measuring eosinophils in the sputum to guide asthma treatment improves asthma outcomes in children and adults.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included studies that compared adjustment of asthma medicines by counting sputum eosinophils versus usual care. To be included, the studies has to decide who would be in which group by chance. The participants all had asthma, diagnosed according to asthma guidelines.</P>
<P>The most recent search for studies was undertaken in February 2017.</P>
<P>This updated review includes six studies involving 382 people with asthma (55 children/adolescents, 327 adults). The studies varied in several ways including study duration and follow-up, sputum eosinophil counts used for adjusting medication and the way the asthma attacks were defined. Studies were between 6 and 24 months long. The age spread of participants in the studies was 12 to 48 years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that guiding asthma medicines based on sputum eosinophil counts (compared to a control group) reduced the number and severity of asthma attacks in adults. In the control group where treatment was guided according to clinical symptoms, 82 participants out of 100 had at least one attack. This was reduced to 62 out of 100 in participants who had their medications guided by sputum eosinophil count. We are not certain about the effect on other measures, such as quality of life or dose of inhaled steroids needed. There is not enough data in children to assess whether using sputum eosinophil is useful.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We are moderately confident in the evidence for any asthma attack and hospital admissions. We were concerned about the different ways the studies defined asthma attacks and the small number of hospital admissions overall, which makes it harder to detect a difference.</P>
<P>We are less confident in the evidence about the dose of inhaled steroids. This is because the studies used very different doses. Also, we cannot tell if the eosinophil-guided treatment reduced or increased the steroid dose overall.</P>

<P>Asthma severity and control can be measured both subjectively and objectively.

<P>Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three new studies were added in this update, resulting in a total of six included studies (five in adults and one involving children/adolescents). These six studies were clinically and methodologically heterogeneous (use of medications, cut-off for percentage of sputum eosinophils and definition of asthma exacerbation). Of 374 participants randomised, 333 completed the trials. In the meta-analysis, there was a significant reduction in the occurrence of any exacerbations when treatment was based on sputum eosinophil counts, compared to that based on clinical symptoms with or without lung function; pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.86). The risk of having one or more exacerbations over 16 months was 82% in the control arm and 62% (95% CI 49% to 74%) in the sputum strategy arm, resulting in a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 6 (95% CI 4 to 13).</P>
<P>There were also differences between the groups in the rate of exacerbation (any exacerbation per year) and severity of exacerbations defined by requirement for use of oral corticosteroids and hospitalisations: the risk of one or more hospitalisations over 16 months was 24% in controls compared to 8% (95% CI 3% to 21%) in the sputum arm. Data for clinical symptoms, quality of life and spirometry were not significantly different between groups. The mean dose of inhaled corticosteroids per day was also similar in both groups. However sputum induction was not always possible. The included studies did not record any adverse events.</P>
<P>One study was not blinded and thus was considered to have a high risk of bias. However, when this study was removed in a sensitivity analysis, the difference between the groups for the primary outcome (exacerbations) remained statistically significant between groups. The GRADE quality of the evidence ranged from moderate (for the outcomes 'Occurrence of any exacerbation' and 'Hospitalisation' ) to low (for the outcome 'Mean dose of inhaled corticosteroids per person per day') due to the inconsistency in defining exacerbations and the small number of hospital admissions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-20 18:20:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>In this updated review, tailoring asthma interventions based on sputum eosinophils is beneficial in reducing the frequency of asthma exacerbations in adults with asthma. Adults with frequent exacerbations and severe asthma may derive the greatest benefit from this additional monitoring test, although we were unable to confirm this through subgroup analysis. There is insufficient data available to assess tailoring asthma medications based on sputum eosinophilia in children.</P>
<P>Further robust RCTs need to be undertaken and these should include participants with different underlying asthma severities and endotypes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma guidelines aim to guide health practitioners in adjusting treatment for patients so as to minimise symptoms or improve asthma control, optimise lung function, and prevent acute exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Asthma-Council-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Asthma Council 2014</LINK>). Exacerbations are important as they cause anxiety to patients and their families and are costly to healthcare systems (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2001</LINK>). Preventing exacerbations is thus an important component for maintaining ideal asthma control. The second component in asthma management is monitoring of asthma control (by subjective and objective measures) (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Asthma-Council-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Asthma Council 2014</LINK>). Subjective measures usually involve a series of questions used for clinical assessment, diary cards and quality-of-life questionnaires. Traditional objective measures include peak flow monitoring, spirometry and degree of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) (Zacharasiewicz 2005). Other methods such as markers of airway inflammation (e.g. sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide levels and breath condensate markers) have been advocated for asthma monitoring. These may be more sensitive markers than subjective measures, as they directly measure airway inflammation, in comparison to traditional objective measures (Zacharasiewicz 2005).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of airway inflammation in people with asthma</HEADING>
<P>Airway inflammation in asthma may be eosinophilic, neutrophilic or a mixture of both (<LINK REF="REF-Douwes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douwes 2002</LINK>). Asthma management is arguably best tailored in accordance with the type of airway inflammation, as corticosteroids are more beneficial in eosinophilic inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2000</LINK>), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms and asthma control (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several ways to quantify airway eosinophilic inflammation, such as determining the percentage of eosinophils in the sputum or in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Recurrent use of the latter is not feasible in clinical medicine as it is an invasive procedure (e.g. usually requiring general anaesthesia in children). Induced sputum is not invasive, it is much simpler to obtain sputum and it provides similar (but not identical) data to that of bronchoalveolar lavage. Induced sputum can be obtained by several methods including the use of nebulised hypertonic saline or mannitol (as part of a bronchial provocation testing) and chest physiotherapy techniques such as using airway clearance apparatus like the flute. The sputum obtained is then prepared and the total cell and differential cellularity determined, thereby providing the relative percentages of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages. Analysis of induced sputum is a reproducible method in determining airway inflammation in asthma in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bacci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacci 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In many people with asthma, the percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum is higher than that in non-asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ohnishi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohnishi 1998</LINK>). Neutrophilic airway inflammation has however also been described in people with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2002b</LINK>). Thus assessing airway inflammation by quantitative measurements instead of subjective data potentially allows better tailoring of personal asthma interventions, which in turn may improve asthma control or reduce exacerbations, or both.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While tailoring asthma medications based on sputum eosinophilia may be helpful, undertaking induced sputum and sputum analysis is labour intensive and not widely available in non-research laboratories. Also, hypertonic saline or mannitol, used to induce sputum, may also temporarily increase asthma symptoms. Thus, a systematic review evaluating the efficacy of tailoring asthma interventions based on sputum analysis (sputum strategy, SS) in comparison with the traditional reliance primarily on clinical symptoms (CS) of asthma will be useful to help guide both physicians and patients as to whether or not undertaking this additional intervention is warranted in improving their asthma outcomes.</P>

<P>For this update, two review authors (HP, AC) independently screened titles, abstracts and descriptors retrieved from the literature searches, to identify potential relevant trials for inclusion. We retrieved potential full text study reports/publications and two review authors (HP, AC) independently screened the full text and identified studies for inclusion, and recorded reasons for exclusion for ineligible studies. We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous data, we reported the proportion of participants contributing to each outcome in comparison to the total number randomised. For rate ratios of common events whereby one participant may have more than one event, we used generic inverse variance (GIV) analysis. The rate ratios were taken from the published papers and the standard errors calculated from CIs or P values published in the papers. We had planned for cross-over studies, to calculate the mean treatment differences from raw data, and variances extracted or imputed and entered as fixed-effect (GIV) outcome, to provide summary weighted differences and 95% CIs.</P>

<P>We included the results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported the outcomes of interest in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed-effect model) were calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK>). For rate ratios of common events whereby one participant may have more than one event, generic inverse variance (GIV) was utilised. The rate ratios were taken from the published papers and the standard errors were calculated from confidence intervals or P values published in the papers. It was planned that for cross-over studies, mean treatment differences would be calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as fixed-effect GIV outcome, to provide summary weighted differences and 95% confidence intervals. For cross-over trials, it was planned that only data from the first arm were included in meta-analysis if data were combined with parallel studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) were calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>). The outcome indices were assumed to be normally distributed continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes could be estimated (weighted mean difference).

<P>Five papers were published in English and one study in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>), which was translated by two independent translators using a standardised extraction form.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design</HEADING>
<P>All six studies were parallel-group studies. One was a multi-centre study (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>); and the other five were uni-centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies were double blind (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>); two were single blind (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>); and one had no blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the included studies differed in a variety of ways including the control arm, intervention arm (i.e. cut-off used for sputum eosinophil percentage used to adjust medications), definition of exacerbations and duration of study. These differences have been outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK> partly fulfilled the inclusion criteria but their data were not included in the meta-analyses as their intervention strategy involved adjusting the medication based on both FeNO levels and sputum eosinophil counts.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The six studies had different inclusion criteria for the participants. All studies included participants with asthma.</P>
<P>Five studies involved only adult patients (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sputum eosinophil strategy (SS)</HEADING>
<P>The intervention arm in the studies, although primarily based on sputum eosinophil percentage, also differed slightly. In two studies, anti-inflammatory treatment was based on maintaining sputum eosinophil count below 3% with a minimum dose of anti-inflammatory treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>). In Jayaram and colleagues' study, medications were adjusted to keep sputum eosinophils to 2% or less using inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>). In Chlumsky and colleagues' study, medications were based on maintaining the sputum eosinophil count below 8% (<LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>). The paediatric paper adjusted treatment to keep sputum eosinophils to less than 2.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intervention arm in Malerba and colleagues' study was based on maintaining FeNO levels at less than 20 ppb, in addition to keeping sputum eosinophil count below 3% (<LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intervention strategies used in the various trials are further described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical symptom strategy (CS)</HEADING>
<P>Four of the six studies utilised existing asthma guidelines to adjust treatment in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>). One study used participant-reported symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>). The sole paediatric study used number of major exacerbations (defined by oral corticosteroid use) and short-acting beta&#8322;-agonists (SABA) use in the preceding three months (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The control group strategies are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All six studies used asthma exacerbations as their primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>). However the definitions of exacerbation were different among the studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In addition to exacerbations, two studies included reported symptoms as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Asthma exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported asthma exacerbations as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>). The five adult studies described a significant reduction in asthma exacerbations in the arm that utilised treatment based on sputum eosinophils (SS) when compared to the clinical symptom (CS) arm (control arm whereby treatment was based primarily on clinical symptoms  lung function) (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>). The adult studies reported a significant difference between groups in exacerbation data, with the SS group experiencing fewer exacerbations than the CS group. The paediatric study did not find a significant difference in the number of exacerbation between the strategies for the study duration (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>). However they did see a difference with smaller number of exacerbations being experienced in the sputum strategy group within 28 days of a study visit. Some but not all data that relate to exacerbations could be combined for meta-analysis. One study utilised FeNO levels in addition to sputum eosinophil counts to adjust medications in the intervention arm, therefore data from this study were not included in the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Occurrence of any exacerbations (Analysis 1.1)</HEADING>
<P>Combining data from these four studies (3 adults and 1 children), the use of the symptom eosinophil strategy (SS), compared to the clinical symptom strategy (CS), significantly reduced the occurrence of any exacerbations: rate ratio was 0.57 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.86); 269 participants in four studies; P = 0.007. As there was heterogeneity between the studies (I = 51%), we used a random-effects analysis.</P>
<P>In subgroup analysis, we separated children from adult studies. In the adult-based studies (n = 3), use of the sputum strategy (compared to controls) significantly reduced the rate ratio of occurrence of exacerbations: rate ratio was 0.45 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.86), 215 participants in three studies; P = 0.02. The heterogeneity remained high with I = 55%. In children there was only one study and there was no significant difference between the groups but the results numerically favoured the sputum strategy group: rate ratio was 0.75 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.04); 54 participants; P = 0.09. The test for a difference between adults and children showed no statistical significance (Chi = 1.93, df = 1 (P = 0.17), I = 48.1%).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Number of participants who had one or more exacerbations (as defined by authors) during the study period (Analysis 1.2)</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis from data combined from four studies showed that the number of participants experiencing any exacerbation was significantly less (P &lt; 0.001) in the SS group than in the CS group. Pooled OR estimate effect was 0.36 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.62); 269 participants. Using the combined control event rate from the one-year studies of 82%, the NNTB for 16 months was 6 (95% CI 4 to 13); see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>When considering the adult studies only, the SS group had significantly fewer participants experiencing one or more exacerbations compared to the CS group: OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.64); 215 participants in 3 studies; P &lt; 0.001. However, the difference between the two groups in the paediatric study was not statistically significant: OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.71); 54 participants; P = 0.21.

<P>See <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.</P>
<P>None of the participants from either arm in <LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK> were hospitalised, whereas a total of seven in <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK> and 13 in <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK> were hospitalised. Combined data showed a difference between the groups (P = 0.02) favouring the SS group: the OR was 0.28 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.84); 269 participants in four studies. The risk of one or more hospitalisations over 16 months fell from a risk of 24% on control to 8% (95% CI 3% to 21%), giving a 16-month NNTB of 7 (95% CI 5 to 33); see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>When considering only the adults who were hospitalised for subgroup analysis, the difference was no longer statistically significant (P = 0.08); OR 0.14 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.25); 215 participants. Likewise statistical significance was lost when considering only children, (P = 0.16): OR 0.38 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.45). The reduction in statistical power when considering subgroups of adults and children is the most likely reason for the loss of statistical significance in these subgroup findings.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Number of exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids (Analysis 1.4)</HEADING>
<P>The rate of exacerbations requiring treatment with rescue oral corticosteroids was significantly lower in the SS group compared to the CS group in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>), rate ratio of 0.33 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.70); 96 participants in one study, P = 0.004.</P>

As the definition of severe exacerbations (other than that defined in Analyses 1.3 and 1.4) differed between the studies it was difficult to combine this data. Combining the two studies which defined minor exacerbations similarly by loss of asthma control requiring more than four puffs extra of bronchodilators, the number of exacerbations between the groups reached borderline significance (P = 0.05) favouring SS, rate ratio of 0.82 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.00); 150 participants.</P>

<P>Jayaram and colleagues reported types of asthma exacerbations in each group (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>). Sputum could only be obtained in 39 of the 47 exacerbations in the SS group and 63 of the 79 total exacerbations in the CS group. Those exacerbations where sputum could be obtained were classified as eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic and this indicated that the overall reduction in exacerbation rate was largely due to a reduction in eosinophilic exacerbations in this study.</P>

Jayaram and colleagues analysed data based on daily requirement for ICS and long-acting beta&#8322;-agonists (LABA). Asthma severity was defined based on minimum daily maintenance fluticasone (mild asthma = requiring &lt; 250 mcg/day; moderate to severe asthma = requiring 250 mcg/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaram 2006</LINK>). Those with mild asthma (&lt; 250 mcg/day fluticasone equivalent) showed no significant difference: RR 1.34 (95% CI 0.52 to 3.46). Those with moderate to severe asthma (= 250 mcg/day fluticasone equivalent) also showed no significant difference between groups in the RR of exacerbation, although the direction of the outcome favoured the SS group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04).

However, the visual analogue symptom scores, total asthma quality of life scores, peak expiratory flow amplitude (% mean), FEV&#8321; after bronchodilator use and the use of rescue beta&#8322;-agonists did not differ significantly between the two groups in <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review consists of six RCTs involving 374 participants with 344 completing the trials. The studies varied in the sputum eosinophil levels (ranging from 2% to 8%) and algorithms used to adjust medications. The duration of the studies also differed, ranging from 6 to 24 months. We found that asthma exacerbations decreased when treatment was adjusted according to sputum eosinophil percentage. Six participants would need to have their asthma treatment adjusted by sputum eosinophil count for one participant to avoid exacerbation (95% CI 4 to 13). However, the data were robust for adult participants only as there was a single study involving children/adolescents. Also, there were no significant difference between the groups in symptoms of asthma (VAS score, QoL and beta agonist use) but this was limited by little data.</P>
<P>All studies reported exacerbations (our review's primary outcome), but the definition varied among the studies. We were able to combine data for a maximum of four studies for the meta-analysis of the different definitions of exacerbation. The occurrence of any exacerbation was significantly lower in the group that utilised sputum eosinophil counts compared to the symptom strategy (rate ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.86). Likewise, the number of participants having one or more asthma exacerbations was lower in the sputum eosinophil group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.62). The number of people with exacerbations requiring hospitalisations was significantly lower in the sputum eosinophilia strategy (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between groups for the mean daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids at final visit.</P>
<P>In the subgroup analyses, for children the reductions seen between the sputum eosinophil strategy and control strategy for occurrence of any exacerbations (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04), number of participants who had one or more episodes of asthma exacerbation (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.71) or exacerbations requiring hospitalisations (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.45) did not achieve statistical significance (possibly due to lack of statistical power due to small numbers).</P>
<P>In the sensitivity analyses, there were no changes in the primary outcomes when conducting analyses on 'intention to treat' or by removing the one study which did not have any blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included six studies, but the meta-analyses consisted of data from between one to five studies for the various outcomes, including our review's primary outcome. The total number of participants for the various outcomes ranged from 68 (outcomes: mean dose of oral corticosteroids per person per day and yearly cost per person) to 316 (outcome: mean daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids per person per day). Although we contacted authors of the studies, the completeness of the review was limited by availability of data.</P>
<P>Theoretically the use of sputum to guide asthma therapy may result in significant differences in doses of oral or ICS. This meta-analysis found that there was no significant differences in the amount of corticosteroids (inhaled or oral) used between the two groups. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK> reported that the annual cost was not significantly more expensive in the SS group compared to the CS group.</P>
<P>In contrast to the favourable data in the outcome of exacerbations that support the use of sputum to guide asthma therapies, there was a lack of difference between the groups in symptoms of asthma (VAS score, QoL and beta agonist use). While exacerbations are an important outcome, arguably subjective measures of asthma control are also important.</P>
<P>Asthma is a heterogeneous condition, and there is increasing appreciation of non-eosinophilic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Seys-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seys 2017</LINK>) and overlap syndromes (with COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Karampitsakos-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karampitsakos 2016</LINK>). The data from this review is unlikely to be applicable to those who have non-eosinophilic asthma, overlap syndromes, or exacerbations that are non-eosinophilic asthma. Thus, although this meta-analysis that has shown that monitoring airway inflammation through eosinophils in induced sputum is useful in reducing exacerbations in adults, it is arguable that it cannot be universally advocated. However, in people with frequent exacerbations it is likely that this intervention is useful.</P>
<P>None of the studies used the new biologic compounds (e.g. anti-interleukin-5) that is efficacious for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, sputum analysis is restricted to laboratories with specific expertise in inducing and analysing sputum. Obtaining and analysing sputum is relatively time consuming (when compared to exhaled nitric oxide) and is not always successful. Also, it can be very difficult to obtain satisfactory samples in young children.</P>
<P>Lastly this review is limited in children as there was only one small study that included children (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We summarised the evidence for the three main outcomes related to exacerbations and ICS dose in the 'Summary of findings' table. Overall, we judged the quality of evidence to be moderate for exacerbations (due to inconsistency of definition of an exacerbation) and hospitalisations (due to the small number of events). One study was a non-blinded trial but removing this study did not alter the results of the primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the outcome of ICS dose per person per day at the end of the study was low. We downgraded this outcome by one for imprecision and one for lack of blinding in one study. The dose of inhaled steroids varied considerably within and between studies.</P>

<P>We are unaware of any bias in the review process. We used a comprehensive search strategy and adhered to the protocol. Two review authors (HP, AC) independently assessed the risk of bias. We contacted the corresponding authors of all the studies for raw data to include in the meta-analysis. AC and the review editor (Christopher Cates) independently checked the data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and downgrading decisions for the 'Summary of findings' table in order to minimise the risk of bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK> in the meta-analyses would have introduced bias, as the strategy used included FeNO in addition to sputum eosinophil counts.</P>

<P>This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Petsky-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petsky 2007</LINK>) and has been strengthened by the addition of three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2015</LINK>). The findings of both Cochrane Reviews are in agreement, with fewer asthma exacerbations occurring in the group that had their asthma treatment adjusted based on sputum eosinophil percentage.</P>
<P>A recent literature review (<LINK REF="REF-Seys-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seys 2017</LINK>) concluded that monitoring eosinophilic inflammation using sputum cell counts is helpful to monitor asthma severity, control and progression of disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-19 12:29:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results from this review suggests that tailoring asthma interventions based on sputum eosinophils instead of primarily on clinical symptoms with or without spirometry/peak flow decreases frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations, especially eosinophilic exacerbations in adults. However, as data for clinical symptoms, QoL and spirometry were not different between groups, the value of the intervention in all settings is less clear at this time. Nevertheless, the findings of this review support the addition of sputum eosinophil measurement to traditional strategies to tailor asthma interventions in adult patients. Adults with frequent exacerbations and severe asthma may derive the greatest benefit from this additional monitoring test, although we were unable to confirm this through subgroup analysis. Studies using newer biologic compounds for eosinophilic diseases did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and hence this review cannot be extrapolated to these agents (e.g. anti-interleukin-5), Also, as data on children was restricted to a single study with no significant difference between groups for any outcomes, there is insufficient data for or against tailoring asthma medications based on sputum eosinophilia in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-19 20:31:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Further RCTs with groups stratified by asthma severity and type of airway inflammation (eosinophilic or neutrophilic) are required. The trials need to include children as well as adults. The design of future RCTs should preferably be multi-centre studies and include other objective measures of asthma including exhaled nitric oxide in addition to the sputum analysis and traditional outcomes of spirometry and peak flow. Subjective outcome measures should also be determined including scores for asthma control and quality of life. Analysis of costs and possible adverse events of inhaled and oral corticosteroids would also provide additional important information. New RCTs should also report the success rate of sputum induction/differential cell count and adverse events associated with sputum induction.</P>
